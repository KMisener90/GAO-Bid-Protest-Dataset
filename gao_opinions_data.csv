DECISION  
 NARCORPS Specialties, LLC, a small business of Orange Park, Florida, protests the issuance of a task order to Vertical Jobs, Inc., a small business of Leesburg, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  70T01024Q7670N009, issued by the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), for role player support services for training administered to TSA and other components of DHS.

 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.

BACKGROUND  
 On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the subject solicitation to General Services Administration schedule contract holders in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 8.405- 2 as a set -aside for small businesses.  Contracting 
Officer’s St atement (COS) at  1; Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, RFQ at  15, 168.
1  The 
agency sought a vendor to provide role player support services as part of training exercises for  the TSA, Federal Air Marshal Service, Federal Flight Deck Officer 
recurrent training programs, and the TSA Canine Training Center.  RFQ at 78.   The 
solicitation anticipated the issuance of a hybrid task order with time- and-materials and 
fixed -price contract line item numbers for a base period of one year and four, 1 -year 
option periods.  Id.  at 21, 88.  The due date for quotations, as amended, was 
May 13, 2024.  COS at  2. 
 
The solicitation anticipated issuance of the order to the vendor submitting the lowest -
priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) quotation based on the following factors:  
technical approach, past performance, and price.  RFQ at  168.  Under the technical 
approach factor, vendors were to provide a service plan and a transition- in plan that the 
agency would evaluate to determine whether the vendor quoted an executable 
approach or a non- executable approach to the requirement.  Id.  at 170.  Under the past 
performance f actor, vendors were to complete a past performance questionnaire that 
the agency would evaluate to determine whether the vendor demonstrated “a history of developing and delivering satisfactory services/products in the areas described in the 
solicitation ( or areas similar in size, scope and complexity to the solicitation and the 
[statement of work (SOW)]).”  Id. at 168-170.  The agency would assign quotations a 
rating of acceptable or unacceptable under the technical approach and past 
performance factors.  Id. at 170.  The agency would evaluate price by adding the total 
price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Id. at 171. 
 
The agency received two quotations, from NARCORPS  and Vertical Jobs  respectively, 
by the due date on May  13.  COS at  2.  The agency issued the task order to Vertical 
Jobs on August 22, 2024.  Id.   NARCORPS filed a protest with our Office on August  30, 
challenging the agency’s evaluation of Vertical Jobs’ quotation.  Id.   In response, the 
agency informed our Office that it intended to take corrective action.  Id.   Specifically, 
the agency stated that it would cancel the task order, amend the RFQ, request and 
evaluate revised quotations, and make a new source selection decision.  Id.   Based on 
the agency’s proposed corrective action, our Office dismissed the protest as academic 
on September 16.  NARCORPS Specialties, LLC, B-422886, Sept. 16, 2024 
(unpublished decision).  
 
Following the agency’s corrective action, the new due date for quotations was 
October  2, 2024.  COS at  3.  Both NARCORPS and Vertical Jobs submitted quotations.  
 
1 All citations reference the Adobe PDF page number.   Page 3 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  Id.  Vertical Jobs quoted a price of $ 36,097,680; NARCORPS quoted a price of 
$37,841,280.  AR, Tab  16, Unsuccessful Vendor Notification at 2.2  Once the agency 
determined that Vertical Jobs submitted the lowest price, it evaluated Vertical Jobs’ 
technical proposal and concluded that it was technically acceptable.  AR, Tab 14, SSD 
at 1-3.  On December 26, the agency selected Vertical Jobs’ quotation for receipt of the 
task order.  Id. at 3.  This protest followed.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 NARCORPS raises several challenges to the agency’s evaluation of quotations.  The 
protester first contends that agency should have eliminated Vertical Jobs’  quotation 
from the competition because its price was unrealistically low  and demonstrated a lack 
of understanding of the requirements .  Protest at  9-13.  The protester next argues that 
the agency should have assigned Vertical Jobs’ quotation a technical rating of 
unacceptable because, according to the protester, Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past perform ance.  Id. at 13-17.  In its supplemental protest, NARCORPS contends that the 
agency failed to properly document its evaluation under the technical approach factor.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  32.  For reasons discussed below, we dismiss the 
protest in part and deny it in part.

 Challenge to the Absence of a Price Realism Analysis  
 NARCORPS first argues that the agency should have eliminated Vertical Jobs’ quotation from the competition because its quoted price was unrealistically low and reflected a misunderstanding of the requirements.  Protest at  9-10.  In other words, the 
protest er argues that the agency should have, but failed to, conduct a price realism 
analysis.  The intervenor requests dismissal of this argument, contending that the solicitation did not require the agency to conduct a price realism analysis.  Intervenor’s Req.  for Dismissal at  1-3. 
 Price realism is an assessment of whether prices are too low, such that there may be a  
risk of poor performance.  Maxim Healthcare Servs. , Inc. , B-412967.9, B-412967.11, 
June 25, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 230 at  8.  While an agency may conduct a price realism 
analysis in awarding a fixed- price or time -and-materials task order for the limited 
purpose of assessing whether a vendor’s low price reflects a lack of technical understand ing or risk, the solicitation must advise vendors that it will conduct such an 
analysis.  Advanced C4 Solutions , Inc., B-416250.2 et al. , Oct.  2, 2018, 2018 CPD 
¶ 344 at  5.  If the solicitation does not contain an express price realism provision, we will 
 
2 The evaluated prices of the two quotations, as adjusted for FAR clause 52.217- 8 
(Option to Extend Services), were $39,707,448 and $41,642,226 respectively.  AR, Tab 13, Price Evaluation Team Report at 2; AR, Tab 14, Source Selection Decision 
(SSD) at 1.  
3 Although we do not address every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them and find none to be meritorious.   Page 4 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  conclude that a solicitation contemplates a price realism evaluation only where the 
solicitation provides that:  (1) the agency will review prices to determine whether they are so low that they reflect a lack of technical understanding and (2) a quotation can be rejected or assessed technical risk for offering low prices .  Id. at 6.  Absent such 
solicitation language, agencies are neither required nor permitted to evaluate price realism in awarding a fixed- price contract.  Facility Servs. Mgmt., Inc. , B-420102.3, 
Mar. 29, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 93 at 7 . 
 In support of its argument that the solicitation required a price realism analysis, the protester argues that the solicitation provided that the agency “may reject any quote that is evaluated to be non- compliant with the solicitation requirements or reflec ts a failure to 
comprehend the complexity and risks of the work to be performed.”  Protest at  7; see 
RFQ at  172.  This language, however, does not contain an express provision for a price 
realism analysis.  Nor does it state that the agency would review pr ices to determine 
whether they reflect a lack of technical understanding, or that the agency may reject or assess technical risk to quotations for low prices.  As such, we conclude the solicitation does not authorize the agency to conduct a price realism analysis.  We therefore dismiss this protest ground because it fails to provide a valid basis of protest.  See  
PricewaterhouseCoopers Pub. Sector LLP , B-415129.3, July 31,  2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 272 
at 1 (dismissing challenge to agency’s failure to conduct a pric e realism analysis where 
the solicitation did not obligate the agency to perform a price realism evaluation).  
 Challenge to Past Performance Evaluation  
 The protester  next argues that the agency should have assigned Vertical Jobs’ 
quotation a technical rating of unacceptable because, according to the protester, Vertical Jobs  lacks “adequate past performance” as it has “absolutely no experience 
performing role- playing services  under contracts of the magnitude described in the 
[s]olicitation.  . . over the past three years[.]”  Protest at  13-15.  The protester also 
contends, bas ed on its independent research, that the dollar value for Vertical Jobs’ 
prior cont racts is significantly below the value of the current requirement.  Id.  at 15-16. 
 The evaluation of a vendor ’s past performance is within  the discretion of the contracting 
agency, and we will not substitute our judgment for  reasonably based past performance 
ratings.  See Patricio Enters., Inc. , B-412740 et al. , May 26, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 152 at 7.  
Where a protester challenges an agency’s  past performance evaluation and source 
selection, we will review the evaluation and award decision to determine if they were 
reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’ s evaluation criteria and procurement 
statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency ’s rationale is adequately 
documented.  See id.  
 Based on the record, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation.  Contrary to the protester’s argument that Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past performance in role-playing services that are comparable in size to the subject procurement, Vertical 
Jobs’ quotation included a reference to a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for role-playing services for the Department of Justice with a 5- year period of performance  Page 5 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  and a total value of $5,000, 000, a BPA for role -playing services for DHS with a 1- year 
period of performance and a total value of $2,149,840, and a BPA for role- playing 
services for the Department of State with a 5- year period of performance and a total 
value of $7,000,000.  AR, Tab 10, Vertical Jobs’ Past Performance Quotation at  1-5.  In 
evaluating these references, the technical evaluation team (TET) report documented 
that Vertical Jobs’ quotation “demonstrated multiple Role Player task orders, with several different Government agencies, running concurrently, each with valuations in the several millions and combined values at tens of millions.”  AR, Tab  12, TET Report 
at 5.  The TET report further noted that the agency spoke with representatives from two 
of Vertical Jobs’ submitted references and concluded that, in both instances, their performance received positive feedback and the references closely aligned with the agency ’s current training needs.  Id.   The agency’s independent review of the 
Contractor Performance Assessment Repor ting System also supported these findings.  
See id.  at 5-6.  Therefore, the protester’s contention that Vertical Jobs has no 
comparable experience is unsupported by the evaluation record.  This protest ground is denied.
4 
 Challenge to Technical Approach Evaluation  
 In its supplemental protest, the protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of the Vertical Jobs’ quotation under the technical approach factor, arguing there “is not sufficient documentation or detail to enable the GAO to review TSA’s actions, much less  
to determine if they were reasonable.”  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37.  According 
to the protester, the agency’s evaluation of Vertical Jobs’ quotation “consists largely of a regurgitation of the terms of the [s]olicitation and SOW” and a “parroting” of language 
from Vertical Jobs’ quotation.  Id.  at 33-34.  The agency contends that the evaluation 
was both reasonable and well -documented, but the protester “cherry -picks” portions of 
the TET report to support its argument.  Supp. MOL at  1. 
 
 
4 The protester raises a substantively identical challenge to the agency’s evaluation of 
corporate experience, arguing that “[a] similar analysis” can be applied to both its 
challenge of the agency’s past performance evaluation and the corporate experience evaluation.  See Protest at  13-17.  As the agency points out that, however , the 
evaluation of a vendor’s corporate experience was “simply not a part of the RFQ.”  
Memorandum of Law (MOL)  at 4.  Although the protester cites the SOW as the basis for 
its argument that the solicitation required an evaluation of corporate experience, it is clear from the terms of the solicitation that corporate experience was not an evaluation factor.  RFQ at  168.  Instead, the solicitation provided only for the evaluation of a 
vendor’s technical approach, past performance, and price.  Id.  We therefore dismiss 
this protest ground for failure to state a valid basis of protest as the solicitation here did not contemplate an evaluation of corporate experience.  See Brackett Aircraft Radio Co., B-246282, Jan. 8, 1992, 92- 1 CPD ¶ 43 at 2 (dismissing allegation as failing to 
state valid basis when the allegation did not, on its face, demonstrate improper agency action).   Page 6 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  Based on our review of the record, we find the agency’s evaluation reasonable.  While 
the protester cites Bio -Rad Labs., Inc. , B-297553, Feb.  15, 2006, 2007 CPD ¶ 58 for the 
proposition that an agency cannot simply “parrot back” definitional language from the solicitation in conducting its evaluation, that decision makes clear that our Office took issue with the fact that the evaluation record, in a FAR part 15 procur ement, was 
“devoid of any meaningful documentation.”  Id.  at 11.  The current facts are mar kedly 
different.  Here, the subject solicitation provided for the evaluation of quotations on an LPTA basis, meaning that the agency needed to determine only whether the vendor’s approach met the requirements of the solicitation.  RFQ at  170.  The record r eflects that 
the agency satisfied that standard.  
 For instance, the solicitation provided that vendors “must be experienced in providing role player support services[.]”  RFQ at  78.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs’ service plan, the 
agency noted that Vertical Jobs’ quotation demonstrated twenty -two years of law 
enforcement/canine role- playing experience .  AR, Tab 12, TET Report at 3.   Similarly, 
for the transition -in plan, the solicitation required vendors to “develop and implement the 
detailed transition strategies and processes needed to enable an efficient  transfer of 
services[.]”  RFQ at 87.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs’ quotation, the agency noted that 
Vertical Jobs would “commence a 60- day transition period in order to ensure that 
mission and operational requirement are fully positioned to maintain conti nuous 
coverage without any interruption[.]”  AR, Tab  12, TET Report at  4.  The protester’s 
argument that the agency quoted portions of Vertical Jobs’ quotation and the solicitation in conducting the evaluation does not, in itself, prove that the evaluation was 
unreasonable or lacked adequate documentation.  Instead, the record reflects that the agency considered whether aspects of Vertical Jobs’ quotation met the requirements, 
as required by the solicitation.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.

Vertical Jobs’ past performance.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37-41.  We have 
addressed the adequacy of the agency’s past performance evaluation above, 
concluding that the agency’s evaluation was unobjectionable.  Accordingly, we do not further address the protester’s argument that the evaluation record lacked adequate documentation in this area.",,"

DECISION  
 NARCORPS Specialties, LLC, a small business of Orange Park, Florida, protests the issuance of a task order to Vertical Jobs, Inc., a small business of Leesburg, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  70T01024Q7670N009, issued by the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), for role player support services for training administered to TSA and other components of DHS.  The protester contends that the agency failed to evaluate quotations in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.

BACKGROUND  
 On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the subject solicitation to General Services Administration schedule contract holders in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 8.405- 2 as a set -aside for small businesses.  Contracting 
Officer’s St atement (COS) at  1; Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, RFQ at  15, 168.
1  The 
agency sought a vendor to provide role player support services as part of training exercises for  the TSA, Federal Air Marshal Service, Federal Flight Deck Officer 
recurrent training programs, and the TSA Canine Training Center.  RFQ at 78.   The 
solicitation anticipated the issuance of a hybrid task order with time- and-materials and 
fixed -price contract line item numbers for a base period of one year and four, 1 -year 
option periods.  Id.  at 21, 88.  The due date for quotations, as amended, was 
May 13, 2024.  COS at  2. 
 
The solicitation anticipated issuance of the order to the vendor submitting the lowest -
priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) quotation based on the following factors:  
technical approach, past performance, and price.  RFQ at  168.  Under the technical 
approach factor, vendors were to provide a service plan and a transition- in plan that the 
agency would evaluate to determine whether the vendor quoted an executable 
approach or a non- executable approach to the requirement.  Id.  at 170.  Under the past 
performance f actor, vendors were to complete a past performance questionnaire that 
the agency would evaluate to determine whether the vendor demonstrated “a history of developing and delivering satisfactory services/products in the areas described in the 
solicitation ( or areas similar in size, scope and complexity to the solicitation and the 
[statement of work (SOW)]).”  Id. at 168-170.  The agency would assign quotations a 
rating of acceptable or unacceptable under the technical approach and past 
performance factors.  Id. at 170.  The agency would evaluate price by adding the total 
price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Id. at 171. 
 
The agency received two quotations, from NARCORPS  and Vertical Jobs  respectively, 
by the due date on May  13.  COS at  2.  The agency issued the task order to Vertical 
Jobs on August 22, 2024.  Id.   NARCORPS filed a protest with our Office on August  30, 
challenging the agency’s evaluation of Vertical Jobs’ quotation.  Id.   In response, the 
agency informed our Office that it intended to take corrective action.  Id.   Specifically, 
the agency stated that it would cancel the task order, amend the RFQ, request and 
evaluate revised quotations, and make a new source selection decision.  Id.   Based on 
the agency’s proposed corrective action, our Office dismissed the protest as academic 
on September 16.  NARCORPS Specialties, LLC, B-422886, Sept. 16, 2024 
(unpublished decision).  
 
Following the agency’s corrective action, the new due date for quotations was 
October  2, 2024.  COS at  3.  Both NARCORPS and Vertical Jobs submitted quotations.

determined that Vertical Jobs submitted the lowest price, it evaluated Vertical Jobs’ 
technical proposal and concluded that it was technically acceptable.  AR, Tab 14, SSD

task order.  Id. at 3.  This protest followed.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 NARCORPS raises several challenges to the agency’s evaluation of quotations.  The 
protester first contends that agency should have eliminated Vertical Jobs’  quotation 
from the competition because its price was unrealistically low  and demonstrated a lack 
of understanding of the requirements .  Protest at  9-13.  The protester next argues that 
the agency should have assigned Vertical Jobs’ quotation a technical rating of 
unacceptable because, according to the protester, Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past perform ance.  Id. at 13-17.  In its supplemental protest, NARCORPS contends that the 
agency failed to properly document its evaluation under the technical approach factor.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  32.  For reasons discussed below, we dismiss the 
protest in part and deny it in part.

 Challenge to the Absence of a Price Realism Analysis  
 NARCORPS first argues that the agency should have eliminated Vertical Jobs’ quotation from the competition because its quoted price was unrealistically low and reflected a misunderstanding of the requirements.  Protest at  9-10.  In other words, the 
protest er argues that the agency should have, but failed to, conduct a price realism 
analysis.  The intervenor requests dismissal of this argument, contending that the solicitation did not require the agency to conduct a price realism analysis.  Intervenor’s Req.  for Dismissal at  1-3. 
 Price realism is an assessment of whether prices are too low, such that there may be a  
risk of poor performance.  Maxim Healthcare Servs. , Inc. , B-412967.9, B-412967.11, 
June 25, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 230 at  8.  While an agency may conduct a price realism 
analysis in awarding a fixed- price or time -and-materials task order for the limited 
purpose of assessing whether a vendor’s low price reflects a lack of technical understand ing or risk, the solicitation must advise vendors that it will conduct such an 
analysis.  Advanced C4 Solutions , Inc., B-416250.2 et al. , Oct.  2, 2018, 2018 CPD

(Option to Extend Services), were $39,707,448 and $41,642,226 respectively.  AR, Tab 13, Price Evaluation Team Report at 2; AR, Tab 14, Source Selection Decision 
(SSD) at 1.  
3 Although we do not address every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them and find none to be meritorious.   Page 4 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  conclude that a solicitation contemplates a price realism evaluation only where the 
solicitation provides that:  (1) the agency will review prices to determine whether they are so low that they reflect a lack of technical understanding and (2) a quotation can be rejected or assessed technical risk for offering low prices .  Id. at 6.  Absent such 
solicitation language, agencies are neither required nor permitted to evaluate price realism in awarding a fixed- price contract.  Facility Servs. Mgmt., Inc. , B-420102.3, 
Mar. 29, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 93 at 7 . 
 In support of its argument that the solicitation required a price realism analysis, the protester argues that the solicitation provided that the agency “may reject any quote that is evaluated to be non- compliant with the solicitation requirements or reflec ts a failure to 
comprehend the complexity and risks of the work to be performed.”  Protest at  7; see 
RFQ at  172.  This language, however, does not contain an express provision for a price 
realism analysis.  Nor does it state that the agency would review pr ices to determine 
whether they reflect a lack of technical understanding, or that the agency may reject or assess technical risk to quotations for low prices.  As such, we conclude the solicitation does not authorize the agency to conduct a price realism analysis.  We therefore dismiss this protest ground because it fails to provide a valid basis of protest.  See  
PricewaterhouseCoopers Pub. Sector LLP , B-415129.3, July 31,  2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 272 
at 1 (dismissing challenge to agency’s failure to conduct a pric e realism analysis where 
the solicitation did not obligate the agency to perform a price realism evaluation).  
 Challenge to Past Performance Evaluation  
 The protester  next argues that the agency should have assigned Vertical Jobs’ 
quotation a technical rating of unacceptable because, according to the protester, Vertical Jobs  lacks “adequate past performance” as it has “absolutely no experience 
performing role- playing services  under contracts of the magnitude described in the 
[s]olicitation.  . . over the past three years[.]”  Protest at  13-15.  The protester also 
contends, bas ed on its independent research, that the dollar value for Vertical Jobs’ 
prior cont racts is significantly below the value of the current requirement.  Id.  at 15-16. 
 The evaluation of a vendor ’s past performance is within  the discretion of the contracting 
agency, and we will not substitute our judgment for  reasonably based past performance 
ratings.  See Patricio Enters., Inc. , B-412740 et al. , May 26, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 152 at 7.  
Where a protester challenges an agency’s  past performance evaluation and source 
selection, we will review the evaluation and award decision to determine if they were 
reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’ s evaluation criteria and procurement 
statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency ’s rationale is adequately 
documented.  See id.  
 Based on the record, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation.  Contrary to the protester’s argument that Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past performance in role-playing services that are comparable in size to the subject procurement, Vertical 
Jobs’ quotation included a reference to a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for role-playing services for the Department of Justice with a 5- year period of performance  Page 5 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  and a total value of $5,000, 000, a BPA for role -playing services for DHS with a 1- year 
period of performance and a total value of $2,149,840, and a BPA for role- playing 
services for the Department of State with a 5- year period of performance and a total 
value of $7,000,000.  AR, Tab 10, Vertical Jobs’ Past Performance Quotation at  1-5.  In 
evaluating these references, the technical evaluation team (TET) report documented 
that Vertical Jobs’ quotation “demonstrated multiple Role Player task orders, with several different Government agencies, running concurrently, each with valuations in the several millions and combined values at tens of millions.”  AR, Tab  12, TET Report 
at 5.  The TET report further noted that the agency spoke with representatives from two 
of Vertical Jobs’ submitted references and concluded that, in both instances, their performance received positive feedback and the references closely aligned with the agency ’s current training needs.  Id.   The agency’s independent review of the 
Contractor Performance Assessment Repor ting System also supported these findings.  
See id.  at 5-6.  Therefore, the protester’s contention that Vertical Jobs has no 
comparable experience is unsupported by the evaluation record.  This protest ground is denied.

 Challenge to Technical Approach Evaluation  
 In its supplemental protest, the protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of the Vertical Jobs’ quotation under the technical approach factor, arguing there “is not sufficient documentation or detail to enable the GAO to review TSA’s actions, much less  
to determine if they were reasonable.”  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37.  According 
to the protester, the agency’s evaluation of Vertical Jobs’ quotation “consists largely of a regurgitation of the terms of the [s]olicitation and SOW” and a “parroting” of language 
from Vertical Jobs’ quotation.  Id.  at 33-34.  The agency contends that the evaluation 
was both reasonable and well -documented, but the protester “cherry -picks” portions of 
the TET report to support its argument.  Supp. MOL at  1. 
 
 
4 The protester raises a substantively identical challenge to the agency’s evaluation of 
corporate experience, arguing that “[a] similar analysis” can be applied to both its 
challenge of the agency’s past performance evaluation and the corporate experience evaluation.  See Protest at  13-17.  As the agency points out that, however , the 
evaluation of a vendor’s corporate experience was “simply not a part of the RFQ.”  
Memorandum of Law (MOL)  at 4.  Although the protester cites the SOW as the basis for 
its argument that the solicitation required an evaluation of corporate experience, it is clear from the terms of the solicitation that corporate experience was not an evaluation factor.  RFQ at  168.  Instead, the solicitation provided only for the evaluation of a 
vendor’s technical approach, past performance, and price.  Id.  We therefore dismiss 
this protest ground for failure to state a valid basis of protest as the solicitation here did not contemplate an evaluation of corporate experience.  See Brackett Aircraft Radio Co., B-246282, Jan. 8, 1992, 92- 1 CPD ¶ 43 at 2 (dismissing allegation as failing to 
state valid basis when the allegation did not, on its face, demonstrate improper agency action).   Page 6 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  Based on our review of the record, we find the agency’s evaluation reasonable.  While 
the protester cites Bio -Rad Labs., Inc. , B-297553, Feb.  15, 2006, 2007 CPD ¶ 58 for the 
proposition that an agency cannot simply “parrot back” definitional language from the solicitation in conducting its evaluation, that decision makes clear that our Office took issue with the fact that the evaluation record, in a FAR part 15 procur ement, was 
“devoid of any meaningful documentation.”  Id.  at 11.  The current facts are mar kedly 
different.  Here, the subject solicitation provided for the evaluation of quotations on an LPTA basis, meaning that the agency needed to determine only whether the vendor’s approach met the requirements of the solicitation.  RFQ at  170.  The record r eflects that 
the agency satisfied that standard.  
 For instance, the solicitation provided that vendors “must be experienced in providing role player support services[.]”  RFQ at  78.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs’ service plan, the 
agency noted that Vertical Jobs’ quotation demonstrated twenty -two years of law 
enforcement/canine role- playing experience .  AR, Tab 12, TET Report at 3.   Similarly, 
for the transition -in plan, the solicitation required vendors to “develop and implement the 
detailed transition strategies and processes needed to enable an efficient  transfer of 
services[.]”  RFQ at 87.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs’ quotation, the agency noted that 
Vertical Jobs would “commence a 60- day transition period in order to ensure that 
mission and operational requirement are fully positioned to maintain conti nuous 
coverage without any interruption[.]”  AR, Tab  12, TET Report at  4.  The protester’s 
argument that the agency quoted portions of Vertical Jobs’ quotation and the solicitation in conducting the evaluation does not, in itself, prove that the evaluation was 
unreasonable or lacked adequate documentation.  Instead, the record reflects that the agency considered whether aspects of Vertical Jobs’ quotation met the requirements, 
as required by the solicitation.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.

5 The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly document its evaluation of 
Vertical Jobs’ past performance.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37-41.  We have 
addressed the adequacy of the agency’s past performance evaluation above, 
concluding that the agency’s evaluation was unobjectionable.  Accordingly, we do not further address the protester’s argument that the evaluation record lacked adequate documentation in this area.  "
B-423294,"May 2, 2025",Lockheed Martin Corporation,"1.  Protest that the agency failed to properly consider organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) is denied where the record shows that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to whether the prospective offeror had OCIs and there is no clear evidence in the record that the agency’s conclusion was unreasonable.  
 2.  Supplemental protest challenging the adequacy of the agency’s waiver of rules and procedures pertaining to an OCI is dismissed, where the waiver was executed shortly before GAO’s statutory 100- day deadline, our Office was already prepared to conclude 
that the OCI allegation s had no merit, and GAO’s decision to deny the OCI challenge 
renders academic the challenge to the waiver.  
 3.  Protest that solicitation deprives vendors of the ability to compete intelligently is denied where the record shows that the solicitation is drafted in a fashion that enables 
vendors to intelligently  prepare their proposals.  
DECISION  
 Lockheed Martin Corporation, of Fort Worth, Texas, protests the actions of the Department of the Air Force in connection with fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR)

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has

investigate and evaluate organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) on the part of 
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), of Reston, Virginia,  another 
prospective offeror.  In addition, the protester argues that the FOPR does not provide sufficient information to permit offerors to compete intelligently and fairly.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The Air Force established the distributed battle management node (DBMN) effort to focus on command, control, communications, and battle management capabilities with clear mission value and operational impact by leveraging capabilities from next generation sensors, providing decision support, and if necessary, prosecuting targets 
that would deny access to an area of operations.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 18, FOPR amend. 5, Statement of Objections (SOO) at 13.
1  Among the Air Force’s requirements 
developed under the DBMN effort is the TOC -L, a lightweight, scalable mission system 
that enables tactical command and control elements to quickly relocate, establish datalinks, and connect to a variety of sensors, incl uding military and civilian sources, 
joint coalition, allied, and mission partner networks.  Id.  
 The Air Force has pursued the TOC -L acquisition in two phases.  Id.  The first phase, a 
36-month effort which began in January 2023, includes material procurement of 16 
“TOC -L experimental systems, integration with sensors,” and delivery to units for 
experimentation in operational exercises.  Id.   Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor 
for the first phase.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 15.  
 This protest concerns the second phase (Phase II) of the TOC -L procurement, through 
which the Air Force seeks a systems integrator to design, procure, build, test, deliver, and maintain TOC -L prototype systems.  Id.  at 2.  In 2024, the agency issued the first 
version of the solicitation pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16 under the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) indefinite- delivery, 
indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract.
2  Protest, B -422718, July 3, 2024, 
at 17.  The solicitation provided for a two- step proposal and evaluation process.  Id.  In 
the first step, offerors submitted white papers.  Id.  at 17 -18.  Based on those white 
papers, the agency selected five offerors, including Lockheed Martin and SAIC, to proceed to the second step of submitting “full proposal[s].”  Id. at 18; COS at 2.  
 After receiving and evaluating proposals, the agency selected SAIC for award at an estimated price of approximately $293 million.  Protest, B -422718, July 3, 2024, 
at 7, 24.  Lockheed Martin and another offeror filed protests with our Office challenging

July 30, 2024 (unpublished decision).  Among other things, Lockheed Martin alleged 
that the agency had failed to conduct a reasonable assessment of SAIC’s alleged OCIs.  Lockheed Martin Corp. , supra.  
 In response to the protests, the agency notified our Office that it would take corrective action by amending the solicitation, “receive updated proposals, evaluate updated proposals, and make a new award decision,” as well as “investigate the alleged” OCIs .  
Id.  As a result, on July 30, 2024, we dismissed the prior protests of the issuance of the 
task order to SAIC as academic.   Id.; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra . 
 Following dismissal of the protests, the agency investigated whether OCIs existed for any of the five offerors, and “how to resolve such conflicts.”  AR, Tab 12, OCI Determination and Findings (D&F) at 1.  This inquiry included requesting OCI mitigation plans from offerors.  See  AR, Tab 5, Request for OCI Mitigation Plan at 1.  At the 
conclusion of the investigation, the contracting officer determined that the offerors --
including SAIC and Lockheed Martin--did not have “actual OCIs” and “any potential OCI has been mitigated by the offerors and the government” such that no offeror was precluded from competing.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 23.  
 Subsequently, on November 16, the Air Force issued the current solicitation, now identified as FOPR No.  FA8612- 25-R-B001, as “an amendment” to the initial Phase II 
solicitation ( FA8612- 24-R-B000).  AR, Tab  13, FOPR at 80.  The new FOPR is limited 
to resoliciting step- two proposals from the five offerors that had previously been 
selected to proceed.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at  5.  The FOPR contemplates the 
issuance of one or more cost -plus-fixed -fee task orders with 2- year terms and various 
options.  Id.  at 5.   
 The solicitation provides that the source selection will be made on a best -value tradeoff 
basis considering technical approach and cost factors.  Id. at 13.  The technical 
approach factor has three equally important subfactors:  (1) program management approach; (2) system engineering approach; and (3) existing prototype system.  Id.   
Cost is to be evaluated for realism, reasonableness, and balance. Id.  at 15.  As relevant 
to this protest, offerors must address, among other things, a requirement to integrate third-party software provided as government -furnished equipment (GFE) --specifically 
“Raytheon Solipsys Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3)” --and any 
“contractor proposed software” to meet the technical requirements identified in the FOPR’s system  requirements document (SRD).  AR, Tab 18, FOPR amend.  5 at 24.  
  Page 4 B-423294  The FOPR established a proposal deadline of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 23, 
2025.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at 6.  Lockheed Martin filed this protest on January  23, prior to the submission deadline.

 DISCUSSION 
 
Lockheed Martin asserts that SAIC should be eliminated from the competition due to 
unmitigated OCIs.  In addition, Lockheed Martin argues that the solicitation fails to provide sufficient information for offerors to prepare their proposals on an intelligent and equal basis.  Although we do not specifically address all of Lockheed Martin’s 
arguments, we have considered them all and find that none affords a basis to sustain 
the protest.  
 
Organizational Conflicts of Interest  
 The protester claims that SAIC has unmitigated OCIs.   Comments at 8- 29.  Specifically, 
the protester alleges that SAIC’s role--under a separate contract --as the cloud- based 
command and control (CBC2) software integrator for the Air Force, as well as SAIC’s membership in the Digital Infrastructure (DI) Consor tium,
4 give rise to an impaired 
objectivity OCI and an unequal access to information OCI.5  Protest at 11- 12, 24- 43.  In 
Lockheed Martin’s view, had the agency properly investigated these OCIs, SAIC would have been deemed ineligible for award.  Id.  at 24- 43.  The agency, in response to the 
earlier protests of this procurement, conducted an OCI investigation and determined that SAIC has no “actual OCIs” and “any potential OCI has been mitigated.”  AR, 
Tab 12, OCI D&F at 23.   
 
The FAR requires that contracting officials avoid, neutralize, or mitigate potential 
significant conflicts of interest to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the

our jurisdiction to review protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award

10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
4 According to the protester, the DI Consortium is “the group of contractors that are 
responsible for the development of the DI architecture, digital models, and hardware 
solutions that will be provided as GFE” for this task order.  Protest at 11- 12. 
5 Lockheed Martin initially argued that SAIC also suffers from an unmitigable biased 
ground rules OCI.  Protest at 43- 45.  The agency substantively responded to the 
allegation in the agency report, arguing that the Air Force had appropriately considered and mitigated any potential biased ground rules OCI.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) 
at 22-23.  In its comments on the agency report, Lockheed Martin neither rebutted nor 
responded to the agency’s response.  As such, we find the allegation to be abandoned and will n ot consider it further.   4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); Medical Staffing Sols. USA,

9.505.  The situations in which OCIs arise, as described in FAR subpart 9.5 and the 
decisions of our Office, can be categorized into three groups: (1) biased ground rules; 
(2) unequal access to information; and (3)  impaired objectivity.  Strategic Mgmt . Sols., 
LLC, B-416598.3, B -416598.4, Dec. 17, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 426 at 5.   
 The primary responsibility for determining whether an organizational  conflict is likely to 
arise, and the resulting appropriate action, rests with the contracting agency.  FAR 9.504.  In reviewing protests that challenge an agency’s conflict of interest  
determination, our Office reviews the reasonableness of the contracting officer’s investigation.  Where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether an OCI exists--even when this consideration is given after award --we will not substitute our 
judgment for the agency’s, absent clear evidence that the agency’s conclusion is 
unreasonable.  S uperlative Techs., Inc.; Atlantic Sys. Grp., Inc. , B-415405 et al. , Jan. 5, 
2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 19 at 5.  In this regard, the identification of conflicts of interest  is a 
fact-specific inquiry that requires the exercise of considerable discretion.  Guident 
Techs., Inc. , B-405112.3, June 4, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  166 at 7.  A protester must identify 
hard facts that indicate the existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough.  DV United, LLC , B-411620, 
B-411620.2, Sept. 16, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 300 at 6.  
 
Impaired Objectivity  
 Lockheed Martin first argues that the agency failed to meaningfully consider an alleged impaired objectivity OCI stemming from SAIC’s performance on a different Air Force 
contract.  Comments at 8 -25.  According to the protester, as the CBC2 software 
integr ator, “SAIC would have a potential impaired objectivity OCI with respect to its 
service as both the CBC2 software integrator and the DBMN Phase II contractor at the same time,” based on SAIC’s performance of systems engineering work under the CBC2 contract .  Id. at 9-13. 
 As relevant here, an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm ’s ability to render 
impartial advice to the government in connection with an evaluation of its own products or services, or those of a competitor, is impaired because of the firm ’s competing 
interests.  FAR 9.505- 3; Serco Inc. , B-404033 et al. , Dec. 27, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 302 
at 2.  The concern in such impaired objectivity situations is that a firm ’s ability to render 
impartial advice to the government will be undermined by the firm ’s competing interests.  
PURVIS Sys., Inc. , B-293807.3, B -293807.4, Aug. 16, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 177 at 7.    
 During its OCI investigation, the Air Force recognized that the scope of work for SAIC, in its role as the CBC2 software integrator, includes “systems engineering” and other support.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 3.  As a starting point for the agency’s OCI anal ysis, 
the contracting officer provides the following:   
 
Systems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  determining specifications, identifying and resolving  Page 6 B-423294  interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, 
and supervising design.  Technical direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  developing work statements,  
determining parameters, directing other contractors’ operations, and resolving technical controversies.  In performing these activities, a contractor occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a system’s basic concepts and superv ising their execution by 
other contractors. Therefore, this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.   
 Id. at 8 (quoting FAR 9.505- 1(b)).   
 In reviewing the performance work statement for the CBC2 software integrator contract, the agency noted that the software integrator’s role does implicate at least some of these activities that could influence the instant task order for the TOC -L system, 
including identifying and resolving interface problems, evaluating design, and 
supervising design.  Id.  at 15- 16.  Because the “ CBC2 software is a key subsystem ” for 
the TOC -L system, and the agency expects the contractor under the Phase II 
solicitation “to  provide impartial advice on risk associated with integration of TOC -L and 
CBC2,” the Air Force recognized there “is at least a perception that SAIC may provide advice that is more favorable to their own product.”  Id.  at 17.  The contracting officer 
found, however, that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated by the Air Force’s systems engineering and design review processes.   Specifically, the Air Force identified 
the following factors as mitigating potential conflicts:  (1) the agency’s ownership of t he 
technical direction and approval authority for all TOC -L products; (2) the notice to all 
offerors that CBC2 software will be provided as GFE at a future time, and will not be 
evaluated as satisfying any particular SRD requirement under the Phase II FOPR ; and 
(3) the agency’s retention of final approval authority for all recommendations made by SAIC under the CBC2 contract.  Id. at 17- 18. 
 Lockheed Martin, for its part, acknowledges that the agency did review, and identify, a potential impaired objectivity based on the interplay between SAIC’s CBC2 software integrator work and the TOC -L system task order here.  Comments at 12- 13.  Lockheed 
Martin asserts, however, that the agency’s identified measures are “inadequate” to 
mitigate the OCI.  Id.  at 13- 25.  According to Lockheed Martin, the agency “erroneously 
concluded that because SAIC would only participate in--as opposed to having final responsibility for --evaluating software that it would integrate with CBC2 for [this task 
order], SAIC does not have an impaired objectivity OCI.”  Comments at 15.  In other words, Lockheed Martin insists that the Air Force is improperly relying on its final approval or decision- making authority as a talisman to assert that no impaired 
objectivity OCI exists, citing our decision in Safal Partners , where we found the 
contracting officer’s OCI analysis applied an improper legal standard to the facts of that decisi on.  See Safal Partners, Inc. , B-416937, B -416937.2, Jan. 15, 2019, 2019 CPD 
¶ 20 at 9.   
  Page 7 B-423294  Here, however, unlike in Safal Partners , the record reflects that the agency considered 
the scope and nature of the systems engineering responsibilities SAIC holds under the 
CBC2 contract to find that there was at least a possibility of an impaired objectivity OCI.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 17.  Considering the scope and nature of those responsibilities, the agency compared the possibility for biased recommendations against the implementation of detailed measures in a government system engineering plan for any DBMN requirement, with six defined technical design reviews to “serve as decision gates for design evolution, enabling data- driven and performance- based solutions to 
technical problems.”  See  id. at 10.  Based on the facts and circumstances of the 
potential for impartial advice from SAIC in the CBC2 or TOC -L efforts, and the 
government’s specific efforts to exercise independent oversight and ultimate decision-making authority under each effort, the contracting officer found that government control mitigat ed the potential OCI concerns here.  Id. at 17- 18. 
 Moreover, the contracting officer did not rely on government control alone to find that the OCI was mitigated.  Instead, the Air Force purposefully changed its approach to the procurement, specifying that CBC2 software will not be evaluated as satisfying any particular requirement of the SRD, and that any associated software will be provided as GFE through Air Force contracting channels.  Id. at 17.  Lockheed Martin argues that 
SAIC would nonetheless “be in a position to exercise subjective judgment that favors its own performance.”  Comments at 19.  The various hypothetical scenarios imagined by the protester to support its argument reflect a misconstruing of work at issue in light of the mitigation measures that the agency has carefully constructed and explained.  Simply put, although Lockheed Martin believes that it would be possible for SAIC to continue to advance its own interests rather than offering objective advice to the 
agency, that belief is insufficient to upset the agency’s different, well -documented 
understanding.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC , B-414268.3 et al. , May 30, 2017, 
2017 CPD ¶  175 at 8- 10 (denying allegation of impaired objectivity OCI where 
contractor at issue would not have the level of discretion or requisite decision- making 
authority implicit in protester’s argument).  
 We find that the contracting officer reasonably assessed the potential for competing roles should SAIC win the task order here and reasonably found that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated.  Although the protester essentially expresses disagreement with the contracting officer’s judgments, that provides no basis to find 
those judgments unreasonable.  Systems Made Simple, Inc. , B-412948.2, July 20, 
2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 207 at 12- 13.  This allegation is therefore denied.  
  Unequal Access to Information 
 The protester also challenges the reasonableness of the agency’s assessment of an alleged unequal access to information OCI associated with SAIC’s work on the CBC2 contract and as a member of the DI Consortium.  Comments at 25- 29.  The agency 
asserts that no offeror gained an unfair competitive advantage by their access to nonpublic information.  MOL at 7.  
  Page 8 B-423294  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic 
information as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm a competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmen t contract.  FAR 9.505(b), 9.505- 4; Raytheon Tech. Servs. Co. LLC , 
B-404655.4 et al., Oct. 11, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 236 at  4.  As the FAR makes clear, the  
concern regarding this category of OCIs is that a firm may gain a competitive advantage  based on its possession of ‟[p]roprietary information that was obtained from a  Government official without proper authorization,” or ‟[s]ource selection information . . .  
that is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and such  information would assist that contractor in obtaining the contract.”  FAR 9.505(b); Superlative Techs., Inc ., supra  at 5. 
 As part of the OCI investigation, the contracting officer identified that all “five (5) offerors have access to nonpublic information due to their performance within PEO C3BM and the ABMS Division.”
6  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  To aid in its OCI analysis, the agency 
created a “Bidder’s Library” where the “details for each offeror are provided to determine whether an existing contract gives the contractor access to nonpublic information that will give it an unfair competitive advantage over other offerors in the subject acquisition.”  Id.  The agency’s main measure to neutralize or resolve any unfair competitive 
advantage was the production of “a more complete Bidder’s Library” with information from the CBC2 and DI Consortium efforts.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  Lockheed Martin does not as sert that this release of information was insufficient to mitigate the alleged 
unequal access to information OCI.  
 Instead, Lockheed Martin contests the adequacy of SAIC’s firewall.  Lockheed Martin 
argues that the agency’s analysis did not go far enough because the agency did not 
ask--in the protester’s estimation--sufficient follow- up questions about the nature and 
extent of a firewall that SAIC erected between its CBC2 team and the proposal team 
under this solicitation.   Comments at 25- 29.  However, because the contracting officer 
identified two separate ways in which the potential for unequal access was mitigated--the release of information in the Bidder’s Library and SAIC’s firewall --by failing to 
challenge the adequacy  of the release of information in the Bidder’s Library, Lockheed 
Martin cannot demonstrate harm from its concerns about the adequacy of SAIC’s firewall.  Zolon Tech, Inc. , B-419280.4, Mar. 18, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 154 at 7 (denying 
allegation where agency reas onably concluded there was no unequal access to 
information OCI where record showed that protester and awardee could access the 
same information and protester had not identified any information that would have given awardee an advantage).  That is, as Lock heed Martin appears to concede that there is 
no error in the agency’s neutralization of any related OCI through the equal release of information to all offerors, the protester has identified no reason that we should find

Program Management Office is “one of several acquisition divisions within the . . . Program Executive Office, Command, Control, Communications and Battle Management (PEO C3BM), [that ] is executing the DBMN Phase II acquisition for design 
and production” of TOC -L prototype systems.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 1.   Page 9 B-423294  unreasonable the agency’s entire effort based on a separate firewall mitigation 
measure.  Further, disagreement with the contracting officer’s judgment regarding the scope of an OCI inquiry does not rise to the level of hard facts necessary to support a valid challenge.  Liquidity Servs., Inc. , B-409718 et al. , July 23, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 221 
at 9-10.  On this record, we have no basis to question the contracting officer’s 
conclusion that SAIC did not have access to nonpublic information that would provide the firm with a competitive advantage in this procurement.  LOGC2, Inc., B -416075,

  Waiver  
 On April 25, shortly  before the 100- day deadline for our Office to resolve the protest 
under the Competition in Contracting Act  (CICA) , 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1), the agency  
advised our Office that the Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) for the Air Force had waived th e application of the OCI provisions of FAR subpart 9.5 to this procurement .  
Req. for Partial Dismissal.  Section 9.503 of the FAR states that an agency head or a designee may waive any general rule or procedure of FAR subpart 9.5 by determining that its application in a particular situation would not be in the government’s interest.  
Three days later, on April 28--and 7 days before the 100- day deadline for our Office to 
issue a decision resolving this protest --Lockheed Martin responded, challengin g the 
adequacy of the Air Force’s waiver.  See  Resp. to Req. for Partial Dismissal.   
 As a general rule, our Office will dismiss as academic a protest challenging an OCI 
when the agency elects to waive the OCI.  See ARP Scis., LLC, B -415318.5,

B-407709.6, Dec. 3, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶  281 at 6.  In this case, however, we will not 
follow that general rule.  Our Office is prepared to conclude that the protester’s OCI allegations have no merit, and since a decision to deny the OCI challenges will render academic any associat ed allegation that the waiver was not properly issued--and given 
our statutory mandate under CICA to provide for the “inexpensive and expeditious” resolution of protests --we deny the protest.  31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1); see ARP Scis., 
LLC, supra.  To the extent that Lockheed Martin’s response represents a supplemental 
protest to the adequacy of the agency’s waiver, we dismiss that challenge as academic.  See ARP Scis., LLC , supra.  
 Information in the Solicitation  
 Finally, Lockheed Martin contends that the solicitation does not provide adequate information regarding integration of the BC3 software that will be provided as GFE  for 
the TOC -L system.  Protest at 45- 60.  According to the protester, there are 667 
essential requirements identified in the SRD regarding integration of the BC3 software, and “offerors must explain how they will satisfy those requirements as part of integration of hardware and other software into their proposal solutions” and propose associated costs accordingly.  Id.  at 47.  According to the protester, the agency has not provided  Page 10 B-423294  sufficient information about the capabilities of the BC3 software to allow offerors to 
intelligently prepare proposals on a fair basis.  Comments at 32- 34. 
 The Air Force responds that it has “provided all available information” on the status of the BC3 software, including its current capabilities and the expectations for future development and refinement of the software.  MOL at 26.  The agency asserts that all offerors have access to this information, and that it is appropriate and fair for the agency to require the offerors to propose their own solutions, accordingly, making assumptions and business judgments as needed.  Id.  
 The determination of an agency’s minimum needs and the best method of accommodating them is primarily within the contracting agency’s discretion, and we will not question such a determination unless it has no reasonable basis.  Apogee Eng’ g, 
LLC, B-415976, May 1, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 150 at 3.  In assessing a protester’s claim 
that a solicitation is inadequate, our Office will review the solicitation to determine whether it provides sufficient information for offerors to compete intelligently and on a relatively equal basis.  Fairwater Assocs. , B-414751.2, Sept. 11, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 285 
at 4.  There is no legal requirement that a solicitation be drafted so as to eliminate all 
performance uncertainties.  Northrop Grumman Tech. Servs., Inc. , B-406523, J une 22, 
2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 197 at 12.  Risk is inherent in most types of contracts, and firms must use their professional expertise and business judgment in anticipating a variety of influences affecting performance costs.  Katmai Info. Techs., LLC , B-406885, Sept. 20, 
2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 277 at 5.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment concerning the agency’s needs and how to accommodate them does not show that the agency’s judgment is unreasonable.  Apogee Eng’ g, LLC, supra.  
 Notwithstanding Lockheed Martin’s request for additional information, our review confirms that the solicitation has adequately defined its requirements and provided sufficient information to offerors.  Within the solicitation materials provided to all offerors, is an “SRD gap analysis” that identifies --by number description--each relevant SRD 
requirement, and then provides an assessment of whether the BC3 software as it currently exists satisfies the requirement (completely or partially) or does not satisfy  the 
requirement.  AR, Tab 17, FOPR amend. 4 at 261- 350.  The solicitation also includes 
the “BC3 Integration Plan” that describes the BC3 technology, identifying key technical specifications, integration timeline and responsibilities, and planned testing and validation efforts.  AR, Tab 13, FOPR at  522-26. 
 Although Lockheed Martin acknowledges that the information in the solicitation “tells the offeror where (in terms of the SRD) there are holes in the architectures or the critical BC3 software products,” the protester complains that there the agency has not  provided 
more about the places where the software only partially satisfies requirements or how much effort will be needed to integrate the BC3 software, provided as GFE, and any software the contractors propose to provide into the TOC -L systems.  Comments  
at 41-42.  Notwithstanding the protester’s dissatisfaction, we find nothing objectionable 
with the Air Force’s assessment that the information provided in the solicitation --
apparently all that exists --combined with the offerors’ business judgment, is suff icient for  Page 11 B-423294  offerors to intelligently prepare and assess the cost of their own strategy to meet the 
agency’s needs here.  See  LOGMET LLC , B-421838, Oct. 5, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 237 
at 5-6 (denying protest alleging that solicitation was inadequate where agency provided 
a variety of information about its requirements despite protester’s insistence that agency could provide more detailed informat ion or information in an alternate form).  This 
argument is therefore denied.  
 The protest is denied.

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest that the agency failed to properly consider organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) is denied where the record shows that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to whether the prospective offeror had OCIs and there is no clear evidence in the record that the agency’s conclusion was unreasonable.  
 2.  Supplemental protest challenging the adequacy of the agency’s waiver of rules and procedures pertaining to an OCI is dismissed, where the waiver was executed shortly before GAO’s statutory 100- day deadline, our Office was already prepared to conclude 
that the OCI allegation s had no merit, and GAO’s decision to deny the OCI challenge 
renders academic the challenge to the waiver.  
 3.  Protest that solicitation deprives vendors of the ability to compete intelligently is denied where the record shows that the solicitation is drafted in a fashion that enables 
vendors to intelligently  prepare their proposals.  
DECISION  
 Lockheed Martin Corporation, of Fort Worth, Texas, protests the actions of the Department of the Air Force in connection with fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR)  
No. FA8612- 25-R- B001 , issued for  Tactical Operations C enter  - Light (TOC -L) DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423294  prototype systems .  Lockheed Martin maintains that the agency failed to adequately 
investigate and evaluate organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) on the part of 
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), of Reston, Virginia,  another 
prospective offeror.  In addition, the protester argues that the FOPR does not provide sufficient information to permit offerors to compete intelligently and fairly.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The Air Force established the distributed battle management node (DBMN) effort to focus on command, control, communications, and battle management capabilities with clear mission value and operational impact by leveraging capabilities from next generation sensors, providing decision support, and if necessary, prosecuting targets 
that would deny access to an area of operations.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 18, FOPR amend. 5, Statement of Objections (SOO) at 13.
1  Among the Air Force’s requirements 
developed under the DBMN effort is the TOC -L, a lightweight, scalable mission system 
that enables tactical command and control elements to quickly relocate, establish datalinks, and connect to a variety of sensors, incl uding military and civilian sources, 
joint coalition, allied, and mission partner networks.  Id.  
 The Air Force has pursued the TOC -L acquisition in two phases.  Id.  The first phase, a 
36-month effort which began in January 2023, includes material procurement of 16 
“TOC -L experimental systems, integration with sensors,” and delivery to units for 
experimentation in operational exercises.  Id.   Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor 
for the first phase.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 15.  
 This protest concerns the second phase (Phase II) of the TOC -L procurement, through 
which the Air Force seeks a systems integrator to design, procure, build, test, deliver, and maintain TOC -L prototype systems.  Id.  at 2.  In 2024, the agency issued the first 
version of the solicitation pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16 under the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) indefinite- delivery, 
indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract.
2  Protest, B -422718, July 3, 2024, 
at 17.  The solicitation provided for a two- step proposal and evaluation process.  Id.  In 
the first step, offerors submitted white papers.  Id.  at 17 -18.  Based on those white 
papers, the agency selected five offerors, including Lockheed Martin and SAIC, to proceed to the second step of submitting “full proposal[s].”  Id. at 18; COS at 2.  
 After receiving and evaluating proposals, the agency selected SAIC for award at an estimated price of approximately $293 million.  Protest, B -422718, July 3, 2024, 
at 7, 24.  Lockheed Martin and another offeror filed protests with our Office challenging

B-422718, July 30, 2024 (unpublished decision); Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422718.2, 
July 30, 2024 (unpublished decision).  Among other things, Lockheed Martin alleged 
that the agency had failed to conduct a reasonable assessment of SAIC’s alleged OCIs.  Lockheed Martin Corp. , supra.  
 In response to the protests, the agency notified our Office that it would take corrective action by amending the solicitation, “receive updated proposals, evaluate updated proposals, and make a new award decision,” as well as “investigate the alleged” OCIs .  
Id.  As a result, on July 30, 2024, we dismissed the prior protests of the issuance of the 
task order to SAIC as academic.   Id.; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra . 
 Following dismissal of the protests, the agency investigated whether OCIs existed for any of the five offerors, and “how to resolve such conflicts.”  AR, Tab 12, OCI Determination and Findings (D&F) at 1.  This inquiry included requesting OCI mitigation plans from offerors.  See  AR, Tab 5, Request for OCI Mitigation Plan at 1.  At the 
conclusion of the investigation, the contracting officer determined that the offerors --
including SAIC and Lockheed Martin--did not have “actual OCIs” and “any potential OCI has been mitigated by the offerors and the government” such that no offeror was precluded from competing.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 23.  
 Subsequently, on November 16, the Air Force issued the current solicitation, now identified as FOPR No.  FA8612- 25-R-B001, as “an amendment” to the initial Phase II 
solicitation ( FA8612- 24-R-B000).  AR, Tab  13, FOPR at 80.  The new FOPR is limited 
to resoliciting step- two proposals from the five offerors that had previously been 
selected to proceed.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at  5.  The FOPR contemplates the 
issuance of one or more cost -plus-fixed -fee task orders with 2- year terms and various 
options.  Id.  at 5.   
 The solicitation provides that the source selection will be made on a best -value tradeoff 
basis considering technical approach and cost factors.  Id. at 13.  The technical 
approach factor has three equally important subfactors:  (1) program management approach; (2) system engineering approach; and (3) existing prototype system.  Id.   
Cost is to be evaluated for realism, reasonableness, and balance. Id.  at 15.  As relevant 
to this protest, offerors must address, among other things, a requirement to integrate third-party software provided as government -furnished equipment (GFE) --specifically 
“Raytheon Solipsys Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3)” --and any 
“contractor proposed software” to meet the technical requirements identified in the FOPR’s system  requirements document (SRD).  AR, Tab 18, FOPR amend.  5 at 24.  
  Page 4 B-423294  The FOPR established a proposal deadline of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 23, 
2025.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at 6.  Lockheed Martin filed this protest on January  23, prior to the submission deadline.

 DISCUSSION 
 
Lockheed Martin asserts that SAIC should be eliminated from the competition due to 
unmitigated OCIs.  In addition, Lockheed Martin argues that the solicitation fails to provide sufficient information for offerors to prepare their proposals on an intelligent and equal basis.  Although we do not specifically address all of Lockheed Martin’s 
arguments, we have considered them all and find that none affords a basis to sustain 
the protest.  
 
Organizational Conflicts of Interest  
 The protester claims that SAIC has unmitigated OCIs.   Comments at 8- 29.  Specifically, 
the protester alleges that SAIC’s role--under a separate contract --as the cloud- based 
command and control (CBC2) software integrator for the Air Force, as well as SAIC’s membership in the Digital Infrastructure (DI) Consor tium,
4 give rise to an impaired 
objectivity OCI and an unequal access to information OCI.5  Protest at 11- 12, 24- 43.  In 
Lockheed Martin’s view, had the agency properly investigated these OCIs, SAIC would have been deemed ineligible for award.  Id.  at 24- 43.  The agency, in response to the 
earlier protests of this procurement, conducted an OCI investigation and determined that SAIC has no “actual OCIs” and “any potential OCI has been mitigated.”  AR, 
Tab 12, OCI D&F at 23.   
 
The FAR requires that contracting officials avoid, neutralize, or mitigate potential 
significant conflicts of interest to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the

our jurisdiction to review protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award 
IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code. 
10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
4 According to the protester, the DI Consortium is “the group of contractors that are 
responsible for the development of the DI architecture, digital models, and hardware 
solutions that will be provided as GFE” for this task order.  Protest at 11- 12. 
5 Lockheed Martin initially argued that SAIC also suffers from an unmitigable biased 
ground rules OCI.  Protest at 43- 45.  The agency substantively responded to the 
allegation in the agency report, arguing that the Air Force had appropriately considered and mitigated any potential biased ground rules OCI.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) 
at 22-23.  In its comments on the agency report, Lockheed Martin neither rebutted nor 
responded to the agency’s response.  As such, we find the allegation to be abandoned and will n ot consider it further.   4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); Medical Staffing Sols. USA,

9.505.  The situations in which OCIs arise, as described in FAR subpart 9.5 and the 
decisions of our Office, can be categorized into three groups: (1) biased ground rules; 
(2) unequal access to information; and (3)  impaired objectivity.  Strategic Mgmt . Sols., 
LLC, B-416598.3, B -416598.4, Dec. 17, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 426 at 5.   
 The primary responsibility for determining whether an organizational  conflict is likely to 
arise, and the resulting appropriate action, rests with the contracting agency.  FAR 9.504.  In reviewing protests that challenge an agency’s conflict of interest  
determination, our Office reviews the reasonableness of the contracting officer’s investigation.  Where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether an OCI exists--even when this consideration is given after award --we will not substitute our 
judgment for the agency’s, absent clear evidence that the agency’s conclusion is 
unreasonable.  S uperlative Techs., Inc.; Atlantic Sys. Grp., Inc. , B-415405 et al. , Jan. 5, 
2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 19 at 5.  In this regard, the identification of conflicts of interest  is a 
fact-specific inquiry that requires the exercise of considerable discretion.  Guident 
Techs., Inc. , B-405112.3, June 4, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  166 at 7.  A protester must identify 
hard facts that indicate the existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough.  DV United, LLC , B-411620, 
B-411620.2, Sept. 16, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 300 at 6.  
 
Impaired Objectivity  
 Lockheed Martin first argues that the agency failed to meaningfully consider an alleged impaired objectivity OCI stemming from SAIC’s performance on a different Air Force 
contract.  Comments at 8 -25.  According to the protester, as the CBC2 software 
integr ator, “SAIC would have a potential impaired objectivity OCI with respect to its 
service as both the CBC2 software integrator and the DBMN Phase II contractor at the same time,” based on SAIC’s performance of systems engineering work under the CBC2 contract .  Id. at 9-13. 
 As relevant here, an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm ’s ability to render 
impartial advice to the government in connection with an evaluation of its own products or services, or those of a competitor, is impaired because of the firm ’s competing 
interests.  FAR 9.505- 3; Serco Inc. , B-404033 et al. , Dec. 27, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 302 
at 2.  The concern in such impaired objectivity situations is that a firm ’s ability to render 
impartial advice to the government will be undermined by the firm ’s competing interests.  
PURVIS Sys., Inc. , B-293807.3, B -293807.4, Aug. 16, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 177 at 7.    
 During its OCI investigation, the Air Force recognized that the scope of work for SAIC, in its role as the CBC2 software integrator, includes “systems engineering” and other support.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 3.  As a starting point for the agency’s OCI anal ysis, 
the contracting officer provides the following:   
 
Systems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  determining specifications, identifying and resolving  Page 6 B-423294  interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, 
and supervising design.  Technical direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  developing work statements,  
determining parameters, directing other contractors’ operations, and resolving technical controversies.  In performing these activities, a contractor occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a system’s basic concepts and superv ising their execution by 
other contractors. Therefore, this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.   
 Id. at 8 (quoting FAR 9.505- 1(b)).   
 In reviewing the performance work statement for the CBC2 software integrator contract, the agency noted that the software integrator’s role does implicate at least some of these activities that could influence the instant task order for the TOC -L system, 
including identifying and resolving interface problems, evaluating design, and 
supervising design.  Id.  at 15- 16.  Because the “ CBC2 software is a key subsystem ” for 
the TOC -L system, and the agency expects the contractor under the Phase II 
solicitation “to  provide impartial advice on risk associated with integration of TOC -L and 
CBC2,” the Air Force recognized there “is at least a perception that SAIC may provide advice that is more favorable to their own product.”  Id.  at 17.  The contracting officer 
found, however, that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated by the Air Force’s systems engineering and design review processes.   Specifically, the Air Force identified 
the following factors as mitigating potential conflicts:  (1) the agency’s ownership of t he 
technical direction and approval authority for all TOC -L products; (2) the notice to all 
offerors that CBC2 software will be provided as GFE at a future time, and will not be 
evaluated as satisfying any particular SRD requirement under the Phase II FOPR ; and 
(3) the agency’s retention of final approval authority for all recommendations made by SAIC under the CBC2 contract.  Id. at 17- 18. 
 Lockheed Martin, for its part, acknowledges that the agency did review, and identify, a potential impaired objectivity based on the interplay between SAIC’s CBC2 software integrator work and the TOC -L system task order here.  Comments at 12- 13.  Lockheed 
Martin asserts, however, that the agency’s identified measures are “inadequate” to 
mitigate the OCI.  Id.  at 13- 25.  According to Lockheed Martin, the agency “erroneously 
concluded that because SAIC would only participate in--as opposed to having final responsibility for --evaluating software that it would integrate with CBC2 for [this task 
order], SAIC does not have an impaired objectivity OCI.”  Comments at 15.  In other words, Lockheed Martin insists that the Air Force is improperly relying on its final approval or decision- making authority as a talisman to assert that no impaired 
objectivity OCI exists, citing our decision in Safal Partners , where we found the 
contracting officer’s OCI analysis applied an improper legal standard to the facts of that decisi on.  See Safal Partners, Inc. , B-416937, B -416937.2, Jan. 15, 2019, 2019 CPD 
¶ 20 at 9.   
  Page 7 B-423294  Here, however, unlike in Safal Partners , the record reflects that the agency considered 
the scope and nature of the systems engineering responsibilities SAIC holds under the 
CBC2 contract to find that there was at least a possibility of an impaired objectivity OCI.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 17.  Considering the scope and nature of those responsibilities, the agency compared the possibility for biased recommendations against the implementation of detailed measures in a government system engineering plan for any DBMN requirement, with six defined technical design reviews to “serve as decision gates for design evolution, enabling data- driven and performance- based solutions to 
technical problems.”  See  id. at 10.  Based on the facts and circumstances of the 
potential for impartial advice from SAIC in the CBC2 or TOC -L efforts, and the 
government’s specific efforts to exercise independent oversight and ultimate decision-making authority under each effort, the contracting officer found that government control mitigat ed the potential OCI concerns here.  Id. at 17- 18. 
 Moreover, the contracting officer did not rely on government control alone to find that the OCI was mitigated.  Instead, the Air Force purposefully changed its approach to the procurement, specifying that CBC2 software will not be evaluated as satisfying any particular requirement of the SRD, and that any associated software will be provided as GFE through Air Force contracting channels.  Id. at 17.  Lockheed Martin argues that 
SAIC would nonetheless “be in a position to exercise subjective judgment that favors its own performance.”  Comments at 19.  The various hypothetical scenarios imagined by the protester to support its argument reflect a misconstruing of work at issue in light of the mitigation measures that the agency has carefully constructed and explained.  Simply put, although Lockheed Martin believes that it would be possible for SAIC to continue to advance its own interests rather than offering objective advice to the 
agency, that belief is insufficient to upset the agency’s different, well -documented 
understanding.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC , B-414268.3 et al. , May 30, 2017, 
2017 CPD ¶  175 at 8- 10 (denying allegation of impaired objectivity OCI where 
contractor at issue would not have the level of discretion or requisite decision- making 
authority implicit in protester’s argument).  
 We find that the contracting officer reasonably assessed the potential for competing roles should SAIC win the task order here and reasonably found that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated.  Although the protester essentially expresses disagreement with the contracting officer’s judgments, that provides no basis to find 
those judgments unreasonable.  Systems Made Simple, Inc. , B-412948.2, July 20, 
2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 207 at 12- 13.  This allegation is therefore denied.  
  Unequal Access to Information 
 The protester also challenges the reasonableness of the agency’s assessment of an alleged unequal access to information OCI associated with SAIC’s work on the CBC2 contract and as a member of the DI Consortium.  Comments at 25- 29.  The agency 
asserts that no offeror gained an unfair competitive advantage by their access to nonpublic information.  MOL at 7.  
  Page 8 B-423294  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic 
information as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm a competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmen t contract.  FAR 9.505(b), 9.505- 4; Raytheon Tech. Servs. Co. LLC , 
B-404655.4 et al., Oct. 11, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 236 at  4.  As the FAR makes clear, the  
concern regarding this category of OCIs is that a firm may gain a competitive advantage  based on its possession of ‟[p]roprietary information that was obtained from a  Government official without proper authorization,” or ‟[s]ource selection information . . .  
that is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and such  information would assist that contractor in obtaining the contract.”  FAR 9.505(b); Superlative Techs., Inc ., supra  at 5. 
 As part of the OCI investigation, the contracting officer identified that all “five (5) offerors have access to nonpublic information due to their performance within PEO C3BM and the ABMS Division.”
6  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  To aid in its OCI analysis, the agency 
created a “Bidder’s Library” where the “details for each offeror are provided to determine whether an existing contract gives the contractor access to nonpublic information that will give it an unfair competitive advantage over other offerors in the subject acquisition.”  Id.  The agency’s main measure to neutralize or resolve any unfair competitive 
advantage was the production of “a more complete Bidder’s Library” with information from the CBC2 and DI Consortium efforts.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  Lockheed Martin does not as sert that this release of information was insufficient to mitigate the alleged 
unequal access to information OCI.  
 Instead, Lockheed Martin contests the adequacy of SAIC’s firewall.  Lockheed Martin 
argues that the agency’s analysis did not go far enough because the agency did not 
ask--in the protester’s estimation--sufficient follow- up questions about the nature and 
extent of a firewall that SAIC erected between its CBC2 team and the proposal team 
under this solicitation.   Comments at 25- 29.  However, because the contracting officer 
identified two separate ways in which the potential for unequal access was mitigated--the release of information in the Bidder’s Library and SAIC’s firewall --by failing to 
challenge the adequacy  of the release of information in the Bidder’s Library, Lockheed 
Martin cannot demonstrate harm from its concerns about the adequacy of SAIC’s firewall.  Zolon Tech, Inc. , B-419280.4, Mar. 18, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 154 at 7 (denying 
allegation where agency reas onably concluded there was no unequal access to 
information OCI where record showed that protester and awardee could access the 
same information and protester had not identified any information that would have given awardee an advantage).  That is, as Lock heed Martin appears to concede that there is 
no error in the agency’s neutralization of any related OCI through the equal release of information to all offerors, the protester has identified no reason that we should find

and production” of TOC -L prototype systems.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 1.   Page 9 B-423294  unreasonable the agency’s entire effort based on a separate firewall mitigation 
measure.  Further, disagreement with the contracting officer’s judgment regarding the scope of an OCI inquiry does not rise to the level of hard facts necessary to support a valid challenge.  Liquidity Servs., Inc. , B-409718 et al. , July 23, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 221 
at 9-10.  On this record, we have no basis to question the contracting officer’s 
conclusion that SAIC did not have access to nonpublic information that would provide the firm with a competitive advantage in this procurement.  LOGC2, Inc., B -416075,

  Waiver  
 On April 25, shortly  before the 100- day deadline for our Office to resolve the protest 
under the Competition in Contracting Act  (CICA) , 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1), the agency  
advised our Office that the Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) for the Air Force had waived th e application of the OCI provisions of FAR subpart 9.5 to this procurement .  
Req. for Partial Dismissal.  Section 9.503 of the FAR states that an agency head or a designee may waive any general rule or procedure of FAR subpart 9.5 by determining that its application in a particular situation would not be in the government’s interest.  
Three days later, on April 28--and 7 days before the 100- day deadline for our Office to 
issue a decision resolving this protest --Lockheed Martin responded, challengin g the 
adequacy of the Air Force’s waiver.  See  Resp. to Req. for Partial Dismissal.   
 As a general rule, our Office will dismiss as academic a protest challenging an OCI 
when the agency elects to waive the OCI.  See ARP Scis., LLC, B -415318.5,

B-407709.6, Dec. 3, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶  281 at 6.  In this case, however, we will not 
follow that general rule.  Our Office is prepared to conclude that the protester’s OCI allegations have no merit, and since a decision to deny the OCI challenges will render academic any associat ed allegation that the waiver was not properly issued--and given 
our statutory mandate under CICA to provide for the “inexpensive and expeditious” resolution of protests --we deny the protest.  31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1); see ARP Scis., 
LLC, supra.  To the extent that Lockheed Martin’s response represents a supplemental 
protest to the adequacy of the agency’s waiver, we dismiss that challenge as academic.  See ARP Scis., LLC , supra.  
 Information in the Solicitation  
 Finally, Lockheed Martin contends that the solicitation does not provide adequate information regarding integration of the BC3 software that will be provided as GFE  for 
the TOC -L system.  Protest at 45- 60.  According to the protester, there are 667 
essential requirements identified in the SRD regarding integration of the BC3 software, and “offerors must explain how they will satisfy those requirements as part of integration of hardware and other software into their proposal solutions” and propose associated costs accordingly.  Id.  at 47.  According to the protester, the agency has not provided  Page 10 B-423294  sufficient information about the capabilities of the BC3 software to allow offerors to 
intelligently prepare proposals on a fair basis.  Comments at 32- 34. 
 The Air Force responds that it has “provided all available information” on the status of the BC3 software, including its current capabilities and the expectations for future development and refinement of the software.  MOL at 26.  The agency asserts that all offerors have access to this information, and that it is appropriate and fair for the agency to require the offerors to propose their own solutions, accordingly, making assumptions and business judgments as needed.  Id.  
 The determination of an agency’s minimum needs and the best method of accommodating them is primarily within the contracting agency’s discretion, and we will not question such a determination unless it has no reasonable basis.  Apogee Eng’ g, 
LLC, B-415976, May 1, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 150 at 3.  In assessing a protester’s claim

performance uncertainties.  Northrop Grumman Tech. Servs., Inc. , B-406523, J une 22,

2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 277 at 5.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment concerning the agency’s needs and how to accommodate them does not show that the agency’s judgment is unreasonable.  Apogee Eng’ g, LLC, supra.  
 Notwithstanding Lockheed Martin’s request for additional information, our review confirms that the solicitation has adequately defined its requirements and provided sufficient information to offerors.  Within the solicitation materials provided to all offerors, is an “SRD gap analysis” that identifies --by number description--each relevant SRD 
requirement, and then provides an assessment of whether the BC3 software as it currently exists satisfies the requirement (completely or partially) or does not satisfy  the 
requirement.  AR, Tab 17, FOPR amend. 4 at 261- 350.  The solicitation also includes 
the “BC3 Integration Plan” that describes the BC3 technology, identifying key technical specifications, integration timeline and responsibilities, and planned testing and validation efforts.  AR, Tab 13, FOPR at  522-26. 
 Although Lockheed Martin acknowledges that the information in the solicitation “tells the offeror where (in terms of the SRD) there are holes in the architectures or the critical BC3 software products,” the protester complains that there the agency has not  provided 
more about the places where the software only partially satisfies requirements or how much effort will be needed to integrate the BC3 software, provided as GFE, and any software the contractors propose to provide into the TOC -L systems.  Comments  
at 41-42.  Notwithstanding the protester’s dissatisfaction, we find nothing objectionable 
with the Air Force’s assessment that the information provided in the solicitation --
apparently all that exists --combined with the offerors’ business judgment, is suff icient for  Page 11 B-423294  offerors to intelligently prepare and assess the cost of their own strategy to meet the 
agency’s needs here.  See  LOGMET LLC , B-421838, Oct. 5, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 237 
at 5-6 (denying protest alleging that solicitation was inadequate where agency provided 
a variety of information about its requirements despite protester’s insistence that agency could provide more detailed informat ion or information in an alternate form).  This 
argument is therefore denied.

DECISION  
 Patrona Corporation, a small business of Washington, District of Columbia, protests the issuance of a task order to KMS Solutions, LLC (KMS), a small business of Alexandria, Virginia, under request for proposal s No. N6660424R3003 (RFP), issued by the 
Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems  (NAVSEA)  Command, for nuclear 
submarine maintenance support services.  Patrona argues that the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal and source selection decision were unreasonable.   
 We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 On January 12, 2024, the agency, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 16.5, issued the solicitation as a small business set -aside to holders 
of the Navy’s Seaport Next Generation multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423282   quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Agency Report (AR), Exh. 2, RFP at 9- 10, 113;1 Contracting 
Officer Statement (COS) at 1.   
 
The solicitation sought proposals to provide nuclear submarine maintenance support services for  the Submarine Maintenance Engineering, Planning and Procurement 
(SUBMEPP)  activity , which is an independent field activity organized under the 
NAVSEA Command.  RFP at 9.  SUBMEPP’s mission is to keep assigned Naval ships and submersibles safe, reliable, and affordable though the use of its engineered life 
cycle maintenance and modernization products and services.  Id .  The solicitation 
sought support services to SUBMEPP in the areas of administration, program 
management, and engineering and logistics programs associated with life cycle 
maintenance, modernization, and modification of Naval ships, unique platforms, new 
construction units, and support facilities.  Id . at 10.  
 The solicitation contemplated the issuance of a single,  cost-plus-fixed -fee and cost -
reimbursable task order with a 1- year base period and four 1- year option periods.  RFP 
at 5-6, 113; COS at 3.  Award was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis , 
considering the following factors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) cost.  
RFP at 114.  The technical factor was more important than past performance, and the two non- cost factors, when combined, were significantly more important than the cost 
factor .  Id.  The technical factor comprised three subfactors:  (a) technical approach; 
(b) management approach; and (c) personnel approach.  Id.   The solicitation 
established that technical approach was the most important subfactor within the technical factor, with management approach and personnel approach of equal importance.  Id.  For the technical factor, and each of the subfactors, the agency would 
assign proposals an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id .         at 114- 115.   
 As relevant here, f or the personnel approach subfactor, the solicitation outlined that the 
agency would evaluate:  (1) a staffing plan; and (2) key personnel.  In this regard, the 
solicitation instructed offerors to submit (1) a staffing plan and labor matrix that identified 
all non- key personnel and key personnel; and (2) resumes demonstrating specific 
individual qual ifications for each of the nine positions the solicitation identified as key 
personnel.  Id. at 105- 106, 114; AR, Exh. 2, RFP attach. 6.2, Pe rsonnel Qualifications  
at 1-6.  The RFP provided that the Navy would “evaluate the extent to which the staffing 
plan addresses the labor hours identified in Section B [of the RFP] and proposed 
personnel are able to perform all aspects of the [performance work statement (PWS) /statement of work ( SOW )].”  RFP at 114.  The solicitation also stated that the 
agency would “evaluate the extent to which the proposal demonstrates a staffing plan and key personnel that are qualified, experienced, and suitable for performing the requirements.”  Id.   
 
 
1 All citations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this 
decision, unless otherwise paginated.    Page 3    B-423282   For the key personnel submission, the solicitation instructed offerors to provide one 
resume for each of the nine positions identified as “key personnel.”  Id.  at 106.  In this 
regard, resumes for key personnel were to be submitted in accordance with the format and instructions in RFP attachment 6.2 to include the “employee name, number of years of professional experience, current position/title/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience. ”  RFP 
attach. 6.2 at 6.  RFP attachment 6.2 also included the following note:   “Resumes are 
not required for N on-K ey Personnel.  Resumes submitted for N on-K ey Personnel, apart 
from that of the [senior technical representative], will not be evaluated.”  Id.   
 For past performance, the agency would assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of performance of submitted references.  RFP at 115.  For each past performance 
reference, the agency would first assign a rating of very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant or not relevant.  Id.  The agency would then assess the overall quality of the 
record of past performance and assign a performance confidence rating of substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral confidence, limited confidence or no confidence.  Id.  at 115-116.  As relevant here, the solicitation explained that the agency 
would evaluate “all past performance information collected and determine the quality of the Offeror’s performance, general trends, and usefulness of the information and 
incorporate these into the assignment of a performance confidence  assessment  rating.”  
Id.  More relevant past performance would “have more influence on the past 
performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance.”  Id. 
at 116. 
 The task order would be issued to the responsible offeror whose proposal 
“demonstrates the best value to the G overnment based on the evaluation factors.”  Id. 
at 112- 113.  The solicitation explained that a tradeoff analysis m ight be used when it 
was in the best interest of the government, and if one offeror had a better technical 
capability and a higher total evaluated cost, the agency would “decide whether the 
difference in technical capability [was]  worth the difference in price.”  Id. at 11 4. 
 
The Navy received three proposals, including proposals from Patrona and KMS.  COS at 2.  The agency’s evaluators assessed the proposals of Patrona, the incumbent 
contractor,  and KMS as follows:  
 
 
 
 KMS  Patrona  
Technical  Good  Acceptable  
     Technical Approach  Outstanding  Good  
     Management Approach  Good  Acceptable  
     Personnel Approach  Acceptable  Acceptable  
Past Performance  Substantial Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  
Total Evaluated Cost  $62,312,331  $57,729,578   Page 4    B-423282   AR, Exh. 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (S SEB) Report  at 3; AR, Exh. 6, Source 
Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 4.  The evaluators assigned Patrona’s 
proposal a single strength under the technical approach subfactor, and no weaknesses, 
significant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 16.  No other 
strengths were identified in Patrona’s proposal.  Id.   The evaluators assigned KMS’s 
proposal two strengths under the technical approach subfactor and a single strength under the management approach subfactor, with no identified weaknesses, significant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  Id.  at 3. 
 The evaluators presented a source selection recommendation document  to the source 
selection authority (SSA) that pr ovided the evaluators’ analysis and recommended 
issuing the task order to KMS.  AR, Exh. 5, Source Selection Recommendation Document (SSRD) at 8.  After reviewing this recommendation and all findings of the evaluators, the SSA determined that award to KMS represented the best overall value.  COS at 18; AR, Exh. 6, SSDD at 7 -8.  Specifically,  the SSA determined that , after taking 
into consideration the relative importance of the technical approach and management approach subfactors, KMS’s proposal was superior to Patrona’s under the technical factor.  Id. at 7.  In addition, the SSA determined that KMS’s record of past performance 
was superior to Patrona’s.  Id.  In sum, the SSA concluded that the technical superiority 
represented by KMS’s  proposal was worth the cost premium as compared to Patrona’s  
lower -cost, lower -rated proposal.  Id. at 8.  As a result, the Navy determined that the 
proposal submitted by KMS represented the best value to the government.  Id. 
 On December 31, the Navy issued the task order to KMS.  COS at 18.  After Patrona requested and received a debriefing,  it filed this protest.

 DISCUSSION 
 
The protester challenges the Navy’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal under the past 
performance and technical factor s, including challenges under the technical approach, 
management approach,  and personnel approach subfactors.  Patrona asserts that , 
because of these evaluation errors, the agency’s best -value tradeoff was flawed.  We 
have fully considered all of Patrona’s arguments, and while we do not specifically 
address every argument made, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain 
the protest.   
 
Technical Factor Evaluation  
 Patrona raises numerous challenges to the evaluation of its proposal under the 
solicitation’s most important factor, technical.  Patrona contends that the agency 
unreasonably evaluated Patrona’s technical proposal and failed to assess strengths for

Protest at 8- 13.  The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 15.  The 
agency contends that the protester’s arguments amount to disagreement with the judgment of agency evaluators and do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.  Id.  
 The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition, including the determination of  the relative merits of proposals, is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s  discretion, because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best  
method of accommodating them.  URS Fed. Servs., Inc. , B-413333, Oct. 11, 2016,

In reviewing protests of an agency’s evaluation and source  selection decision in a task or delivery order competition, we do not reevaluate  proposals; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation  criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

et al., Jan. 12, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 48 at 7.  
 
Technical Approach Subfactor  
 The protester first contends that the Navy overlooked multiple strengths in Patrona’s 
proposal under the technical approach subfactor.  Patrona also argues that its proposal would have earned the highest possible rating of “outstanding” under this subfactor, and a higher rating in the technical factor overall, had the Navy given Patrona’s proposal proper credit.  Protest at 8 -9.  The agency disagrees, defending its evaluation of 
Patrona’s technical approach as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  MOL   
at 3-8. 
 Under the technical approach subfactor, the RFP required offerors to respond to four sample problems, each of which required offerors to address various scenarios that implicate specific tasks identified in the solicitation’s PWS and SOW .  COS at 2; RFP 
at 104-105.  The Navy would then evaluate the extent to which the offerors’ responses 
to the four sample problems “demonstrates specific understanding, capability, and experience to successfully perform the requirements, and the soundness of the proposed tec hnical approach.”  RFP at 114.   
 Patrona argues  that the Navy should have awarded Patrona additional strengths for 
numerous aspects of the firm’s  responses to these four sample problems.  In this 
regard, Patrona argues that its responses “repeatedly went above and beyond specified performance requirements,” which the Navy failed to recognize.   Protest at 8.   Patrona 
cites various  proposal  attributes that warranted recognition as strengths by the agency 
but were instead “improperly discounted.”  Id.  at 8-9.    Page 6    B-423282    
The Navy responds  that the evaluators reasonably determined that Patrona’s proposal 
met, but did not exceed, solicitation requirements.  MOL  at 6-7.  In support, the Navy 
provided a declaration from the SSEB chairperson explaining why each of Patrona’s 
claimed strengths under the technical approach subfactor met, but did not exceed, solicitation requirements.  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 3- 5.  The Navy 
also argues that the protester made no attempt in its protest pleadings to establish that the claimed strengths exceed specific solicitation requirements or otherwise meet the 
solicitation’s definition of a strength.
3   MOL at 4.  In this regard, the Navy asserts  that 
Patrona’s protest allegations instead rely on “generalized and conclusory statements 
about its claimed strengths,” without any explanation for how these proposal features 
exceed requirements or would otherwise be entitled to a strength under the soli citation.  
Id. 
  
Our Office has explained that an agency’s judgment that proposal  features did not 
exceed the requirements of the solicitation--and thus did not warrant the assessment of 
unique strengths --is a matter within the agency’s discretion and one that we will not 
disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the ev aluation was 
unreasonable.  Protection Strategies, Inc ., B-416635, Nov. 1, 2018, 2019 CPD ¶ 33 at 8 
n.4.  Further , an agency’s contemporaneous evaluation record is not required to prove a 
negative or document all “determinations of adequacy” ( i.e., why a proposal did not 
receive a strength or weakness).  See, e.g., Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al., 
Nov. 13, 2020, 2021 CPD ¶ 3 at 8.  When a protester raises a challenge regarding why a proposal was not assigned a strength or weakness, we review whether the agency’s explanation or documentation--contemporaneous or otherwise--demonstrates that the 
evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  Id . at 7 -8. 
 
Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal  under this subfactor .  While  the protester repeatedly expresses 
disagreement with the agency’s judgment , Patrona does not demonstrate how its 
responses to these four sample problems  exceeded solicitation requirements or  
warranted additional strengths or significant strengths.   
 
For example,  sample problem No. 1 required offerors to describe the planning, 
development, sustainment and execution tasks necessary to return a submarine to the fleet on a limited timeline, and the solicitation  identified various  specific  PWS/SOW 
tasks applicable to such a scenario.  RFP at 104.  The protester  asserts that the agency 
unreasonably failed to proper ly credit Patrona’s  response to sample problem N o.1 and 
cites Patrona’s  reference to “Table 5” in its proposal as evidence of “Patrona’s expertise 
and knowledge” of maintenance methodology for various submarine systems.  Protest 
at 8.  The protester, however,  provides no explanation for how the content within table 5 
exceeds the solicitation requirements applicable to sample problem N o. 1 or would 
 
3 Relevant here, a strength was defined in the solicitation as “an aspect of an Offeror’s 
proposal with merit or will exceed specified performance or capability requirements to the advantage of the Government during contract performance.”  RFP at 113 .  Page 7    B-423282   otherwise merit the assignment of a strength, see id., nor is an explanation readily 
apparent from the text of Patrona’s proposal.4  See  AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona Technical 
Approach Proposal at 10.  The agency responds that Patrona’s response to sample 
problem No.1 “demonstrated that it understood the current SUBMEPP process it 
currently executes” but “provided no additional benefits other than what the SSEB 
considered the minimum required to be successful.”  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 3.  In this regar d, the agency notes  that Patrona’s response “lacked 
detail” and “was written in a way that assumed the evaluation team knew the processes in which Patrona operated,” which  relied on the evaluators “to fill in many blanks to fully 
understand Patrona’s responses.”  Id .   
 Similarly, Patrona argues that its responses to sample problems N os. 2 and 3 identified 
“multiple additional resources” that “mitigate quality risk and encapsulate expertise Patrona has developed by supporting SUBMEPP since 2014.”
5  Protest at 9.  Patrona 
asserts that the agency did not “consider [] the substantial significance of these 
additional documents.”  Id.   Patrona also contends that it should have been awarded a 
strength for the “risk mitigation process” detailed in its response to sample problem 
No. 4.6  Id.  In support of this point , Patrona explains that under the incumbent contact it 
has developed a virtual screening process for planned maintenance system service 
requests, requiring independent screening of these requests by a second technician--a feature that adds “significant val ue for SUBMEPP.”  Id .  The agency responds that the 
quality control resources Patrona references under sample problems Nos. 2 and 3, are 
“expected of any contractor that performed [the SOW  tasks associated with sample 
problems Nos. 2 and 3].”
7  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 4.  As for Patrona’s 
 
4 By Patrona’s own account,  table 5 simply “ identifies the processes and related 
products that address maintenance and modernization through submarine service life.”  See AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona Technical Approach Proposal at 10.  
5 Sample problem N o. 2 identified specific applicable PWS/SOW sections and 
requested the offeror’s approach to ordering and completing three tasks involving a 
neglected safety feature, a new maintenance documentation requirement, and a response to set of ships failure data that was  transferred to the contractor in advance of 
a scheduled maintenance event.  RFP at 104.  Sample problem N o. 3 also identified 
specific PWS/SOW tasks and requested, among other things, an equipment maintenance plan suitable for input into the Navy’s planned maintenance system information system  (PMSMIS).  Id. at 104- 105.   
6 Sample problem N o. 4 identified PWS/SOW task 4.7 and requested the offeror to 
provide submarine type commander (TYCOM) screening comments and TYCOM recommendations suitable for input into the PMSMIS database for a planned maintenance system service request.  RFP at 105.  
7 Patrona also contends that the Navy should have assigned multiple strengths, and not 
just a single strength, for Patrona’s “internal process guides and quality control checklists” because these guides and checklists were “applicable to multiple S ample 
(continued...)   Page 8    B-423282   “risk mitigation process” justifying a strength for sample problem No. 4, the agency 
explains that Patrona’s risk mitigation and secondary screening processes are standard 
business practices and “merely ensure adequacy of work product prior to delivering the work product to the Navy.”  Id.  at 5.  As such, the agency argues the risk mitigation 
process did not warrant the assessment of a strength.   MOL at 7 -8. 
 Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy’s evaluation. In this regard, t he protester has not demonstrated that its responses to the sample 
problems exceed solicitation requirements or that the agency unreasonably evaluated these aspects of Patrona’s proposal.  Although Patrona may consider aspects of its technical approach to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis on which to sustain the protest. STG, Inc ., supra at 7. 
 In addition, t hroughout its protest under this subfactor, Patrona argues that its proposal 
was “informed by its experience performing the very same requirements” sought  here 
and that its proposal included “meticulous detail that demonstrated its superior knowledge of the requirements, processes, and procedures” required by the solicitation.  See Protest at 8- 9.  Although the protester denies that it is demanding credit for its 
incumbent experience, see Comments at 10- 11, we find that the protester’s arguments, 
at their core, amount to a request that our Office substitute the agency’s  judgment for 
the protester ’s on the basis that Patrona’s experience performing the incumbent 
contract puts the firm in a  better position to determine whether its proposal exceeded 
the solicitation’s requirements.  We decline to do so.  See Systems Implementers, Inc.; Transcend Tech. Sys., LLC , B-418963.5 et al., June 1, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 138 at 16 
(denying contention that prot ester’s proposal merited assessment of multiple additional 
strengths for various aspects of protester’s experience where protester’s view of its experience expressed nothing more than its disagreement with the evaluators’ subjective judgments).  These allegations are denied.  
 
Management Approach Subfactor  
 Patrona next challenges the agency’s evaluation under the management approach subfactor.  Protest at 10- 11.  Patrona makes two principal arguments.  First, the 
protester  argues that its “proven management approach,” and the features and benefits 
 
Problems.”  Protest at 9.  T he agency responds  that it reasonably assigned Patrona’s 
proposal a single strength based on Patrona’s internal process guides and quality 
control checklists, in the aggregate, since they were applicable to all four sample problems .  AR, Exh. 10,  Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 4.  Based on our review of the 
record, we agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require the assignment of multiple  individual strengths for  repeat  occurrences of a positive aspect within an 
offeror’s  response to each sample problem.  We thus deny this protest allegation.   Page 9    B-423282   it outlined in table 16 of its proposal, “warranted a higher rating than A cceptable.”8  Id. 
at 11; Comments at 15.  Second, Patrona contends that the positive ratings it received 
on its 2023 interim Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) 
assessment , reflecting its performance on the incumbent contract, should have 
translated to a rating of “outstanding” under the management approach subfactor.  
Protest at 11.  In this regard, Patrona states that its management team and proposal 
approach mirror the team and approach it is using under the current incumbent contract 
where it has been recognized with several positive CPARS assessments.9  Id.   
 
Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to sustain Patrona’s protest.  First, 
although Patrona cites to the features and benefits included in table 16 of its proposal to 
argue for a higher rating under this subfactor, Patrona does not allege that the agency failed to consider these features.  Protest at 9- 10.  Nor does Patrona articulate how 
these proposal features merit the assignment of a strength or a higher adjectival rating under this subfactor.  See id .  Instead, Patrona’s protest simply r e-states the content of 
its proposal and notes its disagreement with the agency’s evaluation conclusion, which 
as discussed above, does not provide a basis to sustain a protest.   See Perspecta 
Eng’g, Inc ., B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 314 at 7.  
 Additionally, the agency explains that the evaluators considered the information noted in 
table 16 of Patrona’s proposal, such as  the firm’s  “experienced incumbent management 
team” and proposal to  “maintain an effective communication plan.”  See AR, Exh. 10, 
Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5 -6.  The agency concluded that these features and 
others in Patrona’s proposal “squarely met the requirements” and “aligned with standard 
business practices,” but did not reflect an exceptional approach or provide anticipated 
value to the Navy that exceeded solicitation requirements.  Id.  On this record, we see 
no basis to question the agency’s evaluation judgment.
10   
 
8 For the management approach subfactor, the solicitation instructed offerors to 
describe their “overall management approach including details about processes, tools, 
and other unique characteristics that demonstrate the ability to successfully manage this effort.”  RFP at 105.  In turn, the agency would “evaluate the extent to which the 
proposal demonstrates an effective management organization with the capability, processes, and tools to successfully perform the requirements and ensure the highest quality deliverables, communication, cost management, risk management, and subcontractor management.”  Id. at 114.  The agency’s evaluators assigned Patrona’s 
management approach proposal a rating of “acceptable,” noting that Patrona’s management approach “meets requirements and indicated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.   
 
9 Patrona notes that it received positive CPARS assessments spanning the time period 
between December 2020 and December 2023.  Comments  at 13.  
10 Patrona further argues that the agency’s documentation under this subfactor is 
“scant ,” and the protest should accordingly be sustained.  Protest at 11.  We disagree.  
Although we note that the contemporaneous  evaluation record rests on conclusory 
(continued...)   Page 10    B-423282    
Finally, we see no basis to find that the agency was required to align its evaluation findings under the management approach subfactor with Patrona’s prior CPARS ratings on the incumbent contract.  The solicitation’s submission instructions for the management approach subfactor did not request past performance references, nor did the evaluation criteria apprise offerors that the agency would be assessing records of past performance when assessing proposals under the management approach 
subfactor.  See  RFP at 105, 114.  
 The protester essentially urges that the agency’s understanding of Patrona’s performance on the incumbent contract should have supplemented the Navy’s evaluation of the text of Patrona’s management approach proposal.  We disagree.  We see no requirement in the evaluation criteria that would obligate the agency to consider 
an offeror’s prior incumbent performance--as opposed to the various descriptions of the offeror’s management approach the agency requested, and committed to evaluate, under this subfactor.   Additionally, while our decisions have concluded that, in some 
cases, past performance information in the agency’s possession cannot be ignored, we have specifically declined to extend that principle to an agency’s evaluation of technical proposals.  See Enterprise Sols. Realized, Inc. ; Unissant, Inc ., B-409642, B -409642.2, 
June 23, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 201 at 9.  As such, we find no merit to Patrona’s arguments  
here and accordingly deny these protest grounds.  
 
Personnel Approach Subfactor  
 The protester next argues that the agency failed to evaluate Patrona’s staffing plan and 
key personnel in accordance with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria, and that had the Navy done so, the agency would have assigned Patrona’s proposal  several strengths 
and significant strengths --and the highest possible adjectival rating of “outstanding”  
 
statements  about Patrona’s management approach proposal , see AR, Exh.  4, SSEB 
Report  at 21, as noted above, t he agency submitted,  with the agency report, a 
declaration from the SSEB chairperson providing  additional details  supporting the 
evaluators’ conclusions .  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6.  While we 
accord greater weight to contemporaneous materials as opposed to judgments made in response to protest contentions, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed 
rationale for contemporaneous c onclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded 
details, will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection 
decisions --so long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the 
contemporaneous record.  Science & Tech. Corp., B -420216, Jan. 3, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 1 at 8 n.6.  Here, we find that the agency’s post -protest statement  fills in previously 
unrecorded details and provides credible explanations that are consistent with the 
contemporaneous record.   See, e.g. , AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6 
(explaining that the evaluators considered the specific features of Patrona’s management approach proposal but concluded that these features “did not provide  
anticipated value to the Navy beyond the requirements, such as proposing improvements to process efficiency or quality control”) .    Page 11    B-423282   under the personnel approach subfactor.  Protest at 12- 13.  In this regard, Patrona 
makes two general allegations.  First, Patrona argues that the agency failed to consider 
qualifications information for non- key personnel that Patrona included in its staff ing plan.  
Id.  Second, Patrona contends that the Navy did not give Patrona sufficient credit for the 
qualifications of the key personnel it proposed.  Id.   The agency responds that the 
solicitation did not obligate or permit the agency to evaluate the qualification information Patrona elected to include for its proposed non- key personnel.  MOL at 10- 15.  In 
addition, the Navy argues that its evaluation of Patrona’s staffing plan and key personnel was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  Id.   For the reasons 
explained below, we deny this protest ground.  
 By way of background, f or the staffing plan submission, offerors were required to use 
the format provided in RFP attachment 6.1.  RFP at 105;  AR, Exh. 2,  RFP attach. 6.1, 
Staffing P lan.  In this regard, offerors were to provide a “complete labor matrix” that 
“demonstrates an appropriate mix of personnel to accomplish all tasks in the PWS/SOW.”  RFP attach. 6.2 at 1.  Offerors were instructed to use the required format 
to align the proposed mix of personnel with the labor hours identified in RFP section B and RFP attachment 6.2.  RFP at 105; RFP attach. 6.2 at  1.  As relevant here, the 
required format in RFP attachment 6.1 was a Microsoft excel spreadsheet that included columns for the names of proposed personnel, whether the individual is key or non- key, 
the PWS/SOW task area the individual would support, the i ndividual’s proposed labor 
hours, and a final column labeled “notes.”  RFP attach. 6.1.  Finally, the solicitation instructed that when filling out the staffing plan spreadsheet, offerors should “use ‘TBD’ [to be determined]  for non- key positions that do not have identified personnel.”  RFP    
at 105.   
    Non-Key Personnel  
 The protester argues that the solicitation required the agency to assess the individual qualifications and experience information for the non- key personnel identified in 
Patrona’s  staffing plan.  Protest at 12- 13.  Patrona asserts that it “included by name 
nearly 100 non- key incumbent personnel” and included in the “notes” column in the 
staffing plan a “vast amount of information” for its incumbent non- key personnel 
concerning thei r qualifications, certifications, and years of experience.  Id. at 13.  The 
protester contends that had the agency evaluated the qualifications of its non- key 
personnel, Patrona would have received strengths and a “higher rating due to the qualified and experienced individuals ” included in its staffing plan.  Id. at 12- 13. 
 The Navy disagrees, arguing that the solicitation did not contemplate the assessment of individual qualifications for  non-key personnel.  MOL at 10- 13.  The Navy contends that 
Patrona’s interpretation “read[s] an unstated evaluation requirement ” into the solicitation 
and is contradicted by the solicitation’s restriction barring the agency from considering 
non-key personnel resume information.  Id. at 11- 12.  The Navy notes that the 
solicitation did not request qualifications information for non- key personnel, and the 
required format for the staffing plan in RFP attachment 6.1 did not include a column for  
the qualifications for non- key personnel.  Id.  at 11.  Instead, as noted above, the  Page 12    B-423282   offeror’s staffing plan was to include information on whether the employee was key or 
non-key, the labor category, labor hours proposed, and the PWS/SOW task the 
employee would support.  Id. (citing RFP, attach. 6.1).  The solicitation requested this 
information so the Navy could evaluate the extent to which the offerors’ staffing plan addressed  the labor hours identified in RFP section B and confirm that the proposed 
personnel would perform all aspects of the PWS/SOW.  Id. (citing RFP at  114).   
 The Navy maintains that Patrona improperly used the “notes” column of the required labor mix  to insert resume qualifications information for non- key personnel --which the 
solicitation expressly prohibited the agency from considering.  See MOL  at 11- 12 (citing 
RFP attach. 6.2 at 6).  The protester responds that “ [t]he fact that the S olicitation stated 
that the A gency would not evaluate resumes for non- key personnel does not mean that 
the Agency could not consider their qualifications.”  Comments  at 19.   
 When a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of  its provisions.  MSK TriTech Group, LLC , B-421814, Oct. 3, 2023, 2023 
CPD ¶ 235 at 6.  An interpretation is not reasonable if it fails to give meaning to all of a solicitation’s provisions, renders any part of the solicitation absurd or surplus, or creates conflicts.  HumanTouch, LLC , B-419880 et al., Aug. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 283 at 6. 
Here, we find that the agency’s interpretation is reasonable, and the protester’s is not.   
 At the outset,  we note that the relevant  solicitation criterion--requiring the agency to  
evaluate the extent to which the “staffing plan and key personnel [] are qualified, experienced, and suitable for performing the requirements,” see RFP at 114-- appear s to 
suggest the agency was required to evaluate the individual qualifications of all non- key 
personnel identified in an offeror’s staffing plan, as urged by the protester.  This reading, 
however, fails to give effect to the solicitation language as a whole . 
 First, we disagree that the solicitation obligated the agency to evaluate the individual qualifications of non- key personnel that Patrona elected to submit with its staffing plan.  
The RFP instructed that offerors “shall” provide a staffing plan using the format provided in attachment 6.1, staffing plan, and in accordance with attachment 6.2, personnel qualifications.  RFP at 105.  As noted above, this required format did not include a column requesting the input of any qualifications information for non- key personnel.  
See id .  Moreover, the solicitation included a clear statement indicating that “[r]esumes 
submitted for N on-Key Personnel [] will not be evaluated.”   RFP attach. 6.2 at 6.   
 Reading the solicitation as a whole to give effect to all provisions, it is clear that the staffing plan portion of the personnel approach evaluation was intended to assess offerors’ proposed labor mix es for labor category mapping purposes, to ensure the 
staffing plan was aligned with section B, and to confirm that offerors could meet all requirements in the PWS/SOW.  See RFP at 105- 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 1- 3.  
This portion of the evaluation is in contrast with the key personnel evaluation, which, as noted above, involved a request for resumes  for the purpose of  evaluating the specific 
qualifications of nine identified key personnel .  RFP at 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 3- 6.   Page 13    B-423282   Although the sentence in the evaluation criteria, as noted above,  is not a model of 
clarity, it is clear from the solicitation as a whole that  the agency did not intend to 
request, or evaluate, individual qualifications information for the many non- key 
personnel (as opposed to the nine identified key personnel) an offeror could include in 
its staffing plan.  
 Moreover , we find that the vast majority of information Patrona included in the notes 
column for its identified non- key personnel to be, in all practical effect, resume 
information.
11  Faulting the agency for not evaluating individual qualifications information 
for non- personnel that Patrona inserted into the notes column in the staffing plan would 
render extraneous and absurd the solicitation’s prohibition on evaluating resumes for 
non-key personnel.  Cf. HumanTouch, LLC , supra at 6; CACI, Inc. --Fed., B-422774, 
B-422774.2, Oct. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 257.  We thus decline to adopt any 
interpretation that eschews the plain intent of the solicitation to evaluate resume qualifications information for the nine identified key personnel positions only.
12  As a 
result, we see no basis to sustain Patrona’s protest based on the argument that the Navy was obligated to assign strengths or significant strengths to Patrona’s proposal because of alleged superior qualifications of Patrona’s non- key personnel.
13   
 
11 For example, the notes column for non- key personnel in Patrona’s staffing plan 
included such information as the individual’s number of years of professional experience, current position, educational history, professional certifications, and years of experience on the SUBMEPP contract, among other highlighted qualifications, see AR, Exh. 7.2, Patrona Staffing Plan Proposal, which is closely aligned with the information the solicitation requested to be included in resumes for key personnel.  See RFP attach. 6.2 at 6 (requesting “ number of years of professional experience, current 
position/title/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience” ). 
12 To the extent that the protester’s arguments can be read as a challenge to the lack of 
clarity in the solicitation, we note any ambiguity here was apparent from the face of the 
solicitation.  As such, the ambiguity was patent, and any post -award challenge to these  
solicitation terms would be untimely.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1).  
13 We note that the unclear solicitation language at issue here is nearly identical to the 
solicitation language in CACI, Inc. --Fed. , supra, where a protester challenged the 
Navy’s failure to evaluate the qualifications of the awardee’s non- key personnel, which 
the protester argued would have revealed deficiencies in the awardee’s proposal.  Id .  
Our Office found the protester’s argument to be unreasonable given “language in the solicitation that allowed offerors to use unidentified ‘TBD’ employees for non- key 
personnel positions.”  Id . at 11.  As our Office explained, because offerors could 
propose “TBD” for non- key personnel, interpretating the solicitation to require the 
agency to evaluate all non- key personnel qualifications to determine compliance with 
minimum qualifications would “create an absurd situation where the solicitation permitted offerors to submit proposals that would be impossible for the agency to evaluate in accordance with the solicitation.”  Id.    
(continued...)   Page 14    B-423282    
   Key Personnel  
 The protester also argues that the Navy should have assigned Patrona a strength 
because all nine of Patrona’s key personnel met  or exceeded solicitation requirements , 
including meeting or exceeding many of the “desired qualifications” identified in the solicitation .  Protest at  13; Comments at 21- 27.  In particular, the protester asserts that 
the Navy should have assigned a strength for Patrona’s proposed senior technical representative, who Patrona contends exceeds the solicitation’s “desired experience and education criteria” and has over 25 years of experience leading submarine maintenance technical teams for SUBMEPP.  Protest at  13 (citing AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona 
Technical Proposal at 34); Comments at 21- 27.   
 The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably assessed the qualifications represented by Patrona’s proposed key personnel .  MOL at 14.  The evaluators noted 
that Patrona’s proposed key personnel were “suited to perform the requirements, inclusive of the S enior Technical Representative, ” and determined that “the capabilities 
and qualifications of the K ey Personnel are adequate to perform the tasking for which 
they are proposed.”   AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.  In addition, the Navy included a 
declaration from the SSEB chairperson stating that “[t]he SSEB reviewed the key personnel in total for each offeror and found that while some of Patrona’s key personnel met or exceeded some of the desired qualifications, many other s of Patrona’s key 
personnel did not meet or exceed the desired qualifications.”   AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of 
SSEB Chairperson at 7.   As an example, the agency notes that one of the individuals 
proposed for a key personnel position did not have the minimum  desired 10 years of 
supervisory experience, and another did not have a bachelor’s degree in an engineering discipline.  Id.  The Navy explai ns that when deciding whether to assess strengths  
under this subfactor , the evaluators  assessed the “sum total of all personnel” in 
Patrona’s proposal  and determined that the proposed key personnel , in the aggregate,  
“adequately met the requirements,” even if each key personnel  proposed “did not meet 
or exceed all desired qualifications .”  Id.   
 
In response to the Navy’s urging that we adopt a similar position here, Patrona contends that, although the instant solicitation has a comparable provision allowing offerors to submit “TBD” for non -key personnel, see RFP at  105, the same absurd result 
identified in CACI, Inc. --Fed would not arise.  See Comments at  20.  In this regard, 
Patrona does not argue that the solicitation required the agency to disqualify the awardee based on deficiencies in the awardee’s non- key personnel staffing plan but 
instead argues that the agency was required to evaluate t he qualifications of the non-
key personnel Patrona chose to identify in its staffing plan.   See id.  Although we 
acknowledge this distinction, we ultimately conclude that it produces no meaningful difference to the outcome here.  In this regard, reading the solicitation language as a whole and giving effect to all provisions --including the solicitation’s  prohibition on 
evaluating resumes for non- key personnel --we agree with the Navy that the solicitation 
here did not require the agency to assess the qualifications of the non- key personnel 
that Patrona elected to include in its staffing plan proposal.    Page 15    B-423282    
On this record, we can find no basis to sustain Patrona’s protest.   While the protester 
may believe it is entitled to a strength or  strengths because several of its proposed key 
personnel met or exceeded certain desired qualifications , the record shows that the 
agency was aware of both the benefits  and shortcomings  presented by  Patrona’s key 
personnel  proposal  and reasonably  determined that Patrona’s key personnel, overall,  
did not merit a strength.  Although the protester disagrees with the agency’s judgment, the protester has not shown that it was unreasonable for the agency to assess the overall qualifications represented by Patrona’s  key personnel proposal  when deciding 
whether to assign strengths.  See Assessment & Training Sols. Consulting Corp.,        
B-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 177 at 15- 16 (finding protester 
was not entitled to additional strengths for meeting desired qualifications, where the 
agency was aware of the benefits of the protester’s proposal and the protester did not show that the agency’s assignment of strengths was unreasonable) .  Accordingly, these 
allegations are denied.  
 Past Performance  Next, Patrona raises various challenges to the agency’s past performance evaluation.  
Patrona argues that the agency unreasonably failed to consider the relevant past performance of Patrona’s subcontractor on the incumbent project, ICI Services Corporation (ICI).  Patrona also argues that the Navy gave outsized weight to several 
negative performance issues that Patrona experienced on the incumbent contract.  In addition, Patrona contends that the agency unreasonably determined that one of Patrona’s  past per formance references was only “somewhat relevant.”  The protester 
contends that had the Navy not made these errors, Patrona would have been assigned the highest rating of “substantial confidence” instead of the second highest rating of “satisfactory confidence. ”
14  Protest at 13- 17; Comments at 29- 30. 
 The Navy responds that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  The agency argues that it  acted within its discretion to not double count the 
same record of past performance, which reflected the two entities’  (Patrona and ICI)  
performance on the incumbent contract.  The Navy also argues that it reasonably considered Patrona’s performance issues on the incumbent contract, which included staffing shortfalls and alleged falsified timesheets.  Finally, the Navy argues that the evaluators analyzed Patrona’s “reference N o. 2” and reasonably determined that it was 
only somewhat relevant when compared to the scope of this solicitation.  MOL at 15- 18; 
Supp. MOL at  4-6. 
 
14 Patrona also argued initially that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate the past 
performance proposal submitted by KMS.  Protest at 17.  After the agency argued that its evaluation of KMS’s past performance was reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation, the protester failed to address this argument in comments.  See  generally 
Comments.  Accordingly, we dismiss th is allegation as abandoned and do not consider 
it further.  4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr. 12, 2023, 2023 
CPD ¶ 92 at 4 n.3.   Page 16    B-423282    
At the outset, we note that an agency’s evaluation of past performance, including its  consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of an offeror’s performance  history, is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency’s  
assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.  
CrowderGulf, LLC et al. , B-418693.9 et al., Mar. 25, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 90 at 20; 
Metropolitan Interpreters & Translators, Inc ., B-415080.7, B -415080.8, May 14, 2019,  
2019 CPD ¶ 181 at 10.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment does  not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  CrowderGulf, supra at 20.  
Additionally, there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  ENGlobal Gov’t Servs., Inc. , B-419612, B -419612.2, May 14, 2021, 
2021 CPD ¶ 214 at 4- 5. 
 As discussed below, the record here demonstrates that the agency’s past performance evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.   
 First, we find that the Navy reasonably considered the reference Patrona submitted for its subcontractor, ICI, for work ICI performed with Patrona on the incumbent contract.  The record shows that the Navy considered both Patrona’s and ICI’s performance on 
the incumbent contract to be “recent” and “very relevant,” since the efforts on the incumbent contract “involve[] essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and 
complexities this solicitation requires.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 26.  The evaluat ors 
also noted that the reference that Patrona submitted for ICI was the same reference that Patrona submitted for itself as the prime contractor on the incumbent contract.  Id.  The 
evaluators considered this reference, but ultimately concluded that considering this record twice would “not add any additional value to the overall past performance assessment[.]”  Id.  
 The protester argues that the Navy was obligated to give Patrona double credit  for this 
reference, but the solicitation here gave no indication that the agency was required to assign a single past performance reference twice as much weight when the reference was submitted on behalf of both a prime contractor and its subcontractor.  Rather, since the R FP informed offerors that the agency intended to assess “the usefulness of the 
information” when assigning the confidence rating, see RFP at 115, we see no iss ue 
with the Navy’s determination that considering the same reference twice would not add any significant value to the agency’s past performance assessment or its confidence in Patrona’s performance.   
 In addition, Patrona included in its own past performance proposal the following statement:  “ICI’s contributions to the SUBMEPP contract are covered under the P rime 
Contractor [Patrona] CPARS.”  AR, Exh. 7.3, Patrona Past Performance Proposal at 8.  
In this regard, Patrona’s proposal informed the agency that it considered this CPARS to 
cover the performance history of both entities on the incumbent contract.   On this 
record, we find no basis to fault the agency for exercising reasonable discretion to not 
double- count this reference--particularly when Patrona’s own proposal informed the  Page 17    B-423282   Navy that Patrona considered ICI’s contributions  to be “covered under” the record of 
past performance that  Patrona submitted for the incumbent project.  See id.  
 
Second, we find that the Navy reasonably considered and weighed several negative performance issues, along with the positive ratings on Patrona’s CPARS, for the incumbent project.  The record shows that the Navy considered Patrona’s CPARS 
ratings of “very good” and “satisfactory” on the incumbent contract, noting also that performance on the incumbent contract was considered “very relevant” given the “minimal differences between the existing contract and this solicitation.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 23.  However, the Navy identified “two major performance issues” on 
the incumbent contract --both of which, the agency indicated, “significantly decreases 
the Government’s confidence in Patrona being able to successful[ly] execute this 
contract with minimal risk.”  Id.   
 In this regard, the agency’s evaluators explained that after a suspected discrepancy  
reported on a voucher Patrona submitted for the incumbent contract , between the 
observed work hours and the certified hours, the agency conducted an audit confirming that Patrona billed for hours that were not worked.  Id. at 23- 24.  The agency further 
explained that Patrona amended the voucher and removed the inaccurately charged hours, but that this issue nevertheless raised “significant concern with the ability of Patrona to maintain accurate accounting of their work” which “increases the risk of successful contract execution without the presence of fraud, waste or abuse.”  Id. at 24.  
Additionally , the agency identified a persistent issue with “Patrona’s inability to maintain 
staffing levels” consistent with the staffing levels for positions identified in its fixed- price 
tasking.  Id.   In this regard, the evaluators noted that the Navy  endured “periods of 
understaffing while being billed for the entire [fixed- price] amount.”  Id.   The evaluators 
“acknowledged the efforts Patrona was taking to resolve the issue,” but concluded that the “inability of Patrona to adequately staff positions on the contract decreases the level of confidence that Patrona can successfully execute the task ing of this solicitation.”  Id.  
 Patrona argues that “these incidents should not have negatively impacted Patrona’s Past Performance rating, as Patrona took prompt action to rectify these isolated issues.”  
Protest at 16.  In this regard, Patrona argues that the Navy should have given greater weight to Patrona’s explanations in its proposal concerning how it “promptly address ed 
and resolved” those performance issues.  See id. at 15- 16.  Beyond Patrona’s 
disagreement with the Navy’s evaluation judgment, however, Patrona has not provided our Office any basis to question the Navy’s consideration of Patrona’s performance 
issues on this “very relevant” contract.
 15   
 
15 Because we find that the agency reasonably considered these two “major 
performance issues” on Patrona’s “very relevant” incumbent project, AR, Exh. 4, SSEB 
Report  at 23, we see no basis to conclude that the agency would have raised Patrona’s 
past performance rating beyond the second- highest rating of “satisfactory confidence,” 
even if the protester’s other challenges to the past performance evaluation were to be sustained.  See Maywood Closure Co., LLC , B-408343 et al., Aug. 23, 2013, 2013 CPD 
(continued...)   Page 18    B-423282    
Finally, we find that the Navy reasonably assessed Patrona’s “reference N o. 2,” which 
involved Patrona’s program management support for the Navy’s submarine safety and

at 24.  Patrona contends that the Navy improperly overlooked the similarities between 
the two projects, arguing that the Navy ignored the many references to relevant sections of the SOW that Patrona included with this past performance reference.  Comments at 29-30.  The Navy argues in response that the solicitation required offerors to include 
“a written explanation describing [] how the work was or is relevant to the work being proposed in this solicitation,” see  RFP, attach. 6.3, but that Patrona only listed “a series 
of SOW citations, without providing any context.”  Supp. MOL at 3.  As a result, the Navy contends that it assessed the information Patrona provided and came to the reasonable conclusion that the pr oject was only “somewhat relevant.”  Id. at 6. 
 We can find no basis to question the agency’s past performance evaluation.  As our 
Office has said repeatedly, an offeror is responsible for submitting a well -written 
proposal with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the procuring a gency.  See  FEDSYNC BEI, LLC,  B-417492, B -417492.2, July 23, 2019,

performance reference that “listed functional requirements of the PWS without any 
explanati on of how the incumbent’s performance of that requirement satisfied the RFP’s 
requirements.”).  Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy’s conclusions about the relevance of this project.   
 In sum, w e see no merit to the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation of 
Patrona’s past performance; as a result, these allegations are denied.  
 Best-Value  Determination 
 As a final matter, the protester argues that the agency’s best -value determination  
was improper because it was based on a flawed evaluation.  Protest at 17.  This allegation is derivative of the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal.  As discussed above, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluat ion of the protester’s proposal.  Accordingly, we dismiss this argument because

DIGEST  
 Protest  alleging that agency unreasonably evaluated protester’s technical proposal and 
past performance is denied where the record demonstrates that the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  
DECISION  
 Patrona Corporation, a small business of Washington, District of Columbia, protests the issuance of a task order to KMS Solutions, LLC (KMS), a small business of Alexandria, Virginia, under request for proposal s No. N6660424R3003 (RFP), issued by the 
Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems  (NAVSEA)  Command, for nuclear 
submarine maintenance support services.  Patrona argues that the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal and source selection decision were unreasonable.   
 We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 On January 12, 2024, the agency, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 16.5, issued the solicitation as a small business set -aside to holders 
of the Navy’s Seaport Next Generation multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423282   quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Agency Report (AR), Exh. 2, RFP at 9- 10, 113;1 Contracting 
Officer Statement (COS) at 1.   
 
The solicitation sought proposals to provide nuclear submarine maintenance support services for  the Submarine Maintenance Engineering, Planning and Procurement 
(SUBMEPP)  activity , which is an independent field activity organized under the 
NAVSEA Command.  RFP at 9.  SUBMEPP’s mission is to keep assigned Naval ships and submersibles safe, reliable, and affordable though the use of its engineered life 
cycle maintenance and modernization products and services.  Id .  The solicitation 
sought support services to SUBMEPP in the areas of administration, program 
management, and engineering and logistics programs associated with life cycle 
maintenance, modernization, and modification of Naval ships, unique platforms, new 
construction units, and support facilities.  Id . at 10.  
 The solicitation contemplated the issuance of a single,  cost-plus-fixed -fee and cost -
reimbursable task order with a 1- year base period and four 1- year option periods.  RFP 
at 5-6, 113; COS at 3.  Award was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis , 
considering the following factors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) cost.  
RFP at 114.  The technical factor was more important than past performance, and the two non- cost factors, when combined, were significantly more important than the cost 
factor .  Id.  The technical factor comprised three subfactors:  (a) technical approach; 
(b) management approach; and (c) personnel approach.  Id.   The solicitation 
established that technical approach was the most important subfactor within the technical factor, with management approach and personnel approach of equal importance.  Id.  For the technical factor, and each of the subfactors, the agency would 
assign proposals an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id .         at 114- 115.   
 As relevant here, f or the personnel approach subfactor, the solicitation outlined that the 
agency would evaluate:  (1) a staffing plan; and (2) key personnel.  In this regard, the 
solicitation instructed offerors to submit (1) a staffing plan and labor matrix that identified 
all non- key personnel and key personnel; and (2) resumes demonstrating specific 
individual qual ifications for each of the nine positions the solicitation identified as key 
personnel.  Id. at 105- 106, 114; AR, Exh. 2, RFP attach. 6.2, Pe rsonnel Qualifications  
at 1-6.  The RFP provided that the Navy would “evaluate the extent to which the staffing 
plan addresses the labor hours identified in Section B [of the RFP] and proposed 
personnel are able to perform all aspects of the [performance work statement (PWS) /statement of work ( SOW )].”  RFP at 114.  The solicitation also stated that the 
agency would “evaluate the extent to which the proposal demonstrates a staffing plan and key personnel that are qualified, experienced, and suitable for performing the requirements.”  Id.   
 
 
1 All citations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this 
decision, unless otherwise paginated.    Page 3    B-423282   For the key personnel submission, the solicitation instructed offerors to provide one 
resume for each of the nine positions identified as “key personnel.”  Id.  at 106.  In this 
regard, resumes for key personnel were to be submitted in accordance with the format and instructions in RFP attachment 6.2 to include the “employee name, number of years of professional experience, current position/title/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience. ”  RFP 
attach. 6.2 at 6.  RFP attachment 6.2 also included the following note:   “Resumes are 
not required for N on-K ey Personnel.  Resumes submitted for N on-K ey Personnel, apart 
from that of the [senior technical representative], will not be evaluated.”  Id.   
 For past performance, the agency would assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of performance of submitted references.  RFP at 115.  For each past performance 
reference, the agency would first assign a rating of very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant or not relevant.  Id.  The agency would then assess the overall quality of the 
record of past performance and assign a performance confidence rating of substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral confidence, limited confidence or no confidence.  Id.  at 115-116.  As relevant here, the solicitation explained that the agency 
would evaluate “all past performance information collected and determine the quality of the Offeror’s performance, general trends, and usefulness of the information and 
incorporate these into the assignment of a performance confidence  assessment  rating.”  
Id.  More relevant past performance would “have more influence on the past 
performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance.”  Id. 
at 116. 
 The task order would be issued to the responsible offeror whose proposal 
“demonstrates the best value to the G overnment based on the evaluation factors.”  Id. 
at 112- 113.  The solicitation explained that a tradeoff analysis m ight be used when it 
was in the best interest of the government, and if one offeror had a better technical 
capability and a higher total evaluated cost, the agency would “decide whether the 
difference in technical capability [was]  worth the difference in price.”  Id. at 11 4. 
 
The Navy received three proposals, including proposals from Patrona and KMS.  COS at 2.  The agency’s evaluators assessed the proposals of Patrona, the incumbent 
contractor,  and KMS as follows:  
 
 
 
 KMS  Patrona  
Technical  Good  Acceptable  
     Technical Approach  Outstanding  Good  
     Management Approach  Good  Acceptable  
     Personnel Approach  Acceptable  Acceptable  
Past Performance  Substantial Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  
Total Evaluated Cost  $62,312,331  $57,729,578   Page 4    B-423282   AR, Exh. 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (S SEB) Report  at 3; AR, Exh. 6, Source 
Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 4.  The evaluators assigned Patrona’s 
proposal a single strength under the technical approach subfactor, and no weaknesses, 
significant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 16.  No other 
strengths were identified in Patrona’s proposal.  Id.   The evaluators assigned KMS’s 
proposal two strengths under the technical approach subfactor and a single strength under the management approach subfactor, with no identified weaknesses, significant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  Id.  at 3. 
 The evaluators presented a source selection recommendation document  to the source 
selection authority (SSA) that pr ovided the evaluators’ analysis and recommended 
issuing the task order to KMS.  AR, Exh. 5, Source Selection Recommendation Document (SSRD) at 8.  After reviewing this recommendation and all findings of the evaluators, the SSA determined that award to KMS represented the best overall value.  COS at 18; AR, Exh. 6, SSDD at 7 -8.  Specifically,  the SSA determined that , after taking 
into consideration the relative importance of the technical approach and management approach subfactors, KMS’s proposal was superior to Patrona’s under the technical factor.  Id. at 7.  In addition, the SSA determined that KMS’s record of past performance 
was superior to Patrona’s.  Id.  In sum, the SSA concluded that the technical superiority 
represented by KMS’s  proposal was worth the cost premium as compared to Patrona’s  
lower -cost, lower -rated proposal.  Id. at 8.  As a result, the Navy determined that the 
proposal submitted by KMS represented the best value to the government.  Id. 
 On December 31, the Navy issued the task order to KMS.  COS at 18.  After Patrona requested and received a debriefing,  it filed this protest.

 DISCUSSION 
 
The protester challenges the Navy’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal under the past 
performance and technical factor s, including challenges under the technical approach, 
management approach,  and personnel approach subfactors.  Patrona asserts that , 
because of these evaluation errors, the agency’s best -value tradeoff was flawed.  We 
have fully considered all of Patrona’s arguments, and while we do not specifically 
address every argument made, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain 
the protest.   
 
Technical Factor Evaluation  
 Patrona raises numerous challenges to the evaluation of its proposal under the 
solicitation’s most important factor, technical.  Patrona contends that the agency 
unreasonably evaluated Patrona’s technical proposal and failed to assess strengths for

Protest at 8- 13.  The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 15.  The 
agency contends that the protester’s arguments amount to disagreement with the judgment of agency evaluators and do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.  Id.  
 The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition, including the determination of  the relative merits of proposals, is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s  discretion, because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best  
method of accommodating them.  URS Fed. Servs., Inc. , B-413333, Oct. 11, 2016,

In reviewing protests of an agency’s evaluation and source  selection decision in a task or delivery order competition, we do not reevaluate  proposals; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation  criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

et al., Jan. 12, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 48 at 7.  
 
Technical Approach Subfactor  
 The protester first contends that the Navy overlooked multiple strengths in Patrona’s 
proposal under the technical approach subfactor.  Patrona also argues that its proposal would have earned the highest possible rating of “outstanding” under this subfactor, and a higher rating in the technical factor overall, had the Navy given Patrona’s proposal proper credit.  Protest at 8 -9.  The agency disagrees, defending its evaluation of 
Patrona’s technical approach as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  MOL   
at 3-8. 
 Under the technical approach subfactor, the RFP required offerors to respond to four sample problems, each of which required offerors to address various scenarios that implicate specific tasks identified in the solicitation’s PWS and SOW .  COS at 2; RFP 
at 104-105.  The Navy would then evaluate the extent to which the offerors’ responses 
to the four sample problems “demonstrates specific understanding, capability, and experience to successfully perform the requirements, and the soundness of the proposed tec hnical approach.”  RFP at 114.   
 Patrona argues  that the Navy should have awarded Patrona additional strengths for 
numerous aspects of the firm’s  responses to these four sample problems.  In this 
regard, Patrona argues that its responses “repeatedly went above and beyond specified performance requirements,” which the Navy failed to recognize.   Protest at 8.   Patrona 
cites various  proposal  attributes that warranted recognition as strengths by the agency 
but were instead “improperly discounted.”  Id.  at 8-9.    Page 6    B-423282    
The Navy responds  that the evaluators reasonably determined that Patrona’s proposal 
met, but did not exceed, solicitation requirements.  MOL  at 6-7.  In support, the Navy 
provided a declaration from the SSEB chairperson explaining why each of Patrona’s 
claimed strengths under the technical approach subfactor met, but did not exceed, solicitation requirements.  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 3- 5.  The Navy 
also argues that the protester made no attempt in its protest pleadings to establish that the claimed strengths exceed specific solicitation requirements or otherwise meet the 
solicitation’s definition of a strength.
3   MOL at 4.  In this regard, the Navy asserts  that 
Patrona’s protest allegations instead rely on “generalized and conclusory statements 
about its claimed strengths,” without any explanation for how these proposal features 
exceed requirements or would otherwise be entitled to a strength under the soli citation.  
Id. 
  
Our Office has explained that an agency’s judgment that proposal  features did not 
exceed the requirements of the solicitation--and thus did not warrant the assessment of 
unique strengths --is a matter within the agency’s discretion and one that we will not 
disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the ev aluation was 
unreasonable.  Protection Strategies, Inc ., B-416635, Nov. 1, 2018, 2019 CPD ¶ 33 at 8 
n.4.  Further , an agency’s contemporaneous evaluation record is not required to prove a 
negative or document all “determinations of adequacy” ( i.e., why a proposal did not 
receive a strength or weakness).  See, e.g., Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al., 
Nov. 13, 2020, 2021 CPD ¶ 3 at 8.  When a protester raises a challenge regarding why a proposal was not assigned a strength or weakness, we review whether the agency’s explanation or documentation--contemporaneous or otherwise--demonstrates that the 
evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  Id . at 7 -8. 
 
Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal  under this subfactor .  While  the protester repeatedly expresses 
disagreement with the agency’s judgment , Patrona does not demonstrate how its 
responses to these four sample problems  exceeded solicitation requirements or  
warranted additional strengths or significant strengths.   
 
For example,  sample problem No. 1 required offerors to describe the planning, 
development, sustainment and execution tasks necessary to return a submarine to the fleet on a limited timeline, and the solicitation  identified various  specific  PWS/SOW 
tasks applicable to such a scenario.  RFP at 104.  The protester  asserts that the agency 
unreasonably failed to proper ly credit Patrona’s  response to sample problem N o.1 and 
cites Patrona’s  reference to “Table 5” in its proposal as evidence of “Patrona’s expertise 
and knowledge” of maintenance methodology for various submarine systems.  Protest 
at 8.  The protester, however,  provides no explanation for how the content within table 5 
exceeds the solicitation requirements applicable to sample problem N o. 1 or would 
 
3 Relevant here, a strength was defined in the solicitation as “an aspect of an Offeror’s 
proposal with merit or will exceed specified performance or capability requirements to the advantage of the Government during contract performance.”  RFP at 113 .  Page 7    B-423282   otherwise merit the assignment of a strength, see id., nor is an explanation readily 
apparent from the text of Patrona’s proposal.4  See  AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona Technical 
Approach Proposal at 10.  The agency responds that Patrona’s response to sample 
problem No.1 “demonstrated that it understood the current SUBMEPP process it 
currently executes” but “provided no additional benefits other than what the SSEB 
considered the minimum required to be successful.”  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 3.  In this regar d, the agency notes  that Patrona’s response “lacked 
detail” and “was written in a way that assumed the evaluation team knew the processes in which Patrona operated,” which  relied on the evaluators “to fill in many blanks to fully 
understand Patrona’s responses.”  Id .   
 Similarly, Patrona argues that its responses to sample problems N os. 2 and 3 identified 
“multiple additional resources” that “mitigate quality risk and encapsulate expertise Patrona has developed by supporting SUBMEPP since 2014.”
5  Protest at 9.  Patrona 
asserts that the agency did not “consider [] the substantial significance of these 
additional documents.”  Id.   Patrona also contends that it should have been awarded a 
strength for the “risk mitigation process” detailed in its response to sample problem 
No. 4.6  Id.  In support of this point , Patrona explains that under the incumbent contact it 
has developed a virtual screening process for planned maintenance system service 
requests, requiring independent screening of these requests by a second technician--a feature that adds “significant val ue for SUBMEPP.”  Id .  The agency responds that the 
quality control resources Patrona references under sample problems Nos. 2 and 3, are 
“expected of any contractor that performed [the SOW  tasks associated with sample 
problems Nos. 2 and 3].”
7  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 4.  As for Patrona’s 
 
4 By Patrona’s own account,  table 5 simply “ identifies the processes and related 
products that address maintenance and modernization through submarine service life.”  See AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona Technical Approach Proposal at 10.  
5 Sample problem N o. 2 identified specific applicable PWS/SOW sections and 
requested the offeror’s approach to ordering and completing three tasks involving a 
neglected safety feature, a new maintenance documentation requirement, and a response to set of ships failure data that was  transferred to the contractor in advance of 
a scheduled maintenance event.  RFP at 104.  Sample problem N o. 3 also identified 
specific PWS/SOW tasks and requested, among other things, an equipment maintenance plan suitable for input into the Navy’s planned maintenance system information system  (PMSMIS).  Id. at 104- 105.   
6 Sample problem N o. 4 identified PWS/SOW task 4.7 and requested the offeror to 
provide submarine type commander (TYCOM) screening comments and TYCOM recommendations suitable for input into the PMSMIS database for a planned maintenance system service request.  RFP at 105.  
7 Patrona also contends that the Navy should have assigned multiple strengths, and not 
just a single strength, for Patrona’s “internal process guides and quality control checklists” because these guides and checklists were “applicable to multiple S ample 
(continued...)   Page 8    B-423282   “risk mitigation process” justifying a strength for sample problem No. 4, the agency 
explains that Patrona’s risk mitigation and secondary screening processes are standard 
business practices and “merely ensure adequacy of work product prior to delivering the work product to the Navy.”  Id.  at 5.  As such, the agency argues the risk mitigation 
process did not warrant the assessment of a strength.   MOL at 7 -8. 
 Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy’s evaluation. In this regard, t he protester has not demonstrated that its responses to the sample 
problems exceed solicitation requirements or that the agency unreasonably evaluated these aspects of Patrona’s proposal.  Although Patrona may consider aspects of its technical approach to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis on which to sustain the protest. STG, Inc ., supra at 7. 
 In addition, t hroughout its protest under this subfactor, Patrona argues that its proposal 
was “informed by its experience performing the very same requirements” sought  here 
and that its proposal included “meticulous detail that demonstrated its superior knowledge of the requirements, processes, and procedures” required by the solicitation.  See Protest at 8- 9.  Although the protester denies that it is demanding credit for its 
incumbent experience, see Comments at 10- 11, we find that the protester’s arguments, 
at their core, amount to a request that our Office substitute the agency’s  judgment for 
the protester ’s on the basis that Patrona’s experience performing the incumbent 
contract puts the firm in a  better position to determine whether its proposal exceeded 
the solicitation’s requirements.  We decline to do so.  See Systems Implementers, Inc.; Transcend Tech. Sys., LLC , B-418963.5 et al., June 1, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 138 at 16 
(denying contention that prot ester’s proposal merited assessment of multiple additional 
strengths for various aspects of protester’s experience where protester’s view of its experience expressed nothing more than its disagreement with the evaluators’ subjective judgments).  These allegations are denied.  
 
Management Approach Subfactor  
 Patrona next challenges the agency’s evaluation under the management approach subfactor.  Protest at 10- 11.  Patrona makes two principal arguments.  First, the 
protester  argues that its “proven management approach,” and the features and benefits 
 
Problems.”  Protest at 9.  T he agency responds  that it reasonably assigned Patrona’s 
proposal a single strength based on Patrona’s internal process guides and quality 
control checklists, in the aggregate, since they were applicable to all four sample problems .  AR, Exh. 10,  Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 4.  Based on our review of the 
record, we agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require the assignment of multiple  individual strengths for  repeat  occurrences of a positive aspect within an 
offeror’s  response to each sample problem.  We thus deny this protest allegation.   Page 9    B-423282   it outlined in table 16 of its proposal, “warranted a higher rating than A cceptable.”8  Id. 
at 11; Comments at 15.  Second, Patrona contends that the positive ratings it received 
on its 2023 interim Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) 
assessment , reflecting its performance on the incumbent contract, should have 
translated to a rating of “outstanding” under the management approach subfactor.  
Protest at 11.  In this regard, Patrona states that its management team and proposal 
approach mirror the team and approach it is using under the current incumbent contract 
where it has been recognized with several positive CPARS assessments.9  Id.   
 
Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to sustain Patrona’s protest.  First, 
although Patrona cites to the features and benefits included in table 16 of its proposal to 
argue for a higher rating under this subfactor, Patrona does not allege that the agency failed to consider these features.  Protest at 9- 10.  Nor does Patrona articulate how 
these proposal features merit the assignment of a strength or a higher adjectival rating under this subfactor.  See id .  Instead, Patrona’s protest simply r e-states the content of 
its proposal and notes its disagreement with the agency’s evaluation conclusion, which 
as discussed above, does not provide a basis to sustain a protest.   See Perspecta 
Eng’g, Inc ., B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 314 at 7.  
 Additionally, the agency explains that the evaluators considered the information noted in 
table 16 of Patrona’s proposal, such as  the firm’s  “experienced incumbent management 
team” and proposal to  “maintain an effective communication plan.”  See AR, Exh. 10, 
Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5 -6.  The agency concluded that these features and 
others in Patrona’s proposal “squarely met the requirements” and “aligned with standard 
business practices,” but did not reflect an exceptional approach or provide anticipated 
value to the Navy that exceeded solicitation requirements.  Id.  On this record, we see 
no basis to question the agency’s evaluation judgment.
10   
 
8 For the management approach subfactor, the solicitation instructed offerors to 
describe their “overall management approach including details about processes, tools, 
and other unique characteristics that demonstrate the ability to successfully manage this effort.”  RFP at 105.  In turn, the agency would “evaluate the extent to which the 
proposal demonstrates an effective management organization with the capability, processes, and tools to successfully perform the requirements and ensure the highest quality deliverables, communication, cost management, risk management, and subcontractor management.”  Id. at 114.  The agency’s evaluators assigned Patrona’s 
management approach proposal a rating of “acceptable,” noting that Patrona’s management approach “meets requirements and indicated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.   
 
9 Patrona notes that it received positive CPARS assessments spanning the time period 
between December 2020 and December 2023.  Comments  at 13.  
10 Patrona further argues that the agency’s documentation under this subfactor is 
“scant ,” and the protest should accordingly be sustained.  Protest at 11.  We disagree.  
Although we note that the contemporaneous  evaluation record rests on conclusory 
(continued...)   Page 10    B-423282    
Finally, we see no basis to find that the agency was required to align its evaluation findings under the management approach subfactor with Patrona’s prior CPARS ratings on the incumbent contract.  The solicitation’s submission instructions for the management approach subfactor did not request past performance references, nor did the evaluation criteria apprise offerors that the agency would be assessing records of past performance when assessing proposals under the management approach 
subfactor.  See  RFP at 105, 114.  
 The protester essentially urges that the agency’s understanding of Patrona’s performance on the incumbent contract should have supplemented the Navy’s evaluation of the text of Patrona’s management approach proposal.  We disagree.  We see no requirement in the evaluation criteria that would obligate the agency to consider 
an offeror’s prior incumbent performance--as opposed to the various descriptions of the offeror’s management approach the agency requested, and committed to evaluate, under this subfactor.   Additionally, while our decisions have concluded that, in some 
cases, past performance information in the agency’s possession cannot be ignored, we have specifically declined to extend that principle to an agency’s evaluation of technical proposals.  See Enterprise Sols. Realized, Inc. ; Unissant, Inc ., B-409642, B -409642.2, 
June 23, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 201 at 9.  As such, we find no merit to Patrona’s arguments  
here and accordingly deny these protest grounds.  
 
Personnel Approach Subfactor  
 The protester next argues that the agency failed to evaluate Patrona’s staffing plan and 
key personnel in accordance with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria, and that had the Navy done so, the agency would have assigned Patrona’s proposal  several strengths 
and significant strengths --and the highest possible adjectival rating of “outstanding”  
 
statements  about Patrona’s management approach proposal , see AR, Exh.  4, SSEB 
Report  at 21, as noted above, t he agency submitted,  with the agency report, a 
declaration from the SSEB chairperson providing  additional details  supporting the 
evaluators’ conclusions .  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6.  While we 
accord greater weight to contemporaneous materials as opposed to judgments made in response to protest contentions, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed 
rationale for contemporaneous c onclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded 
details, will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection 
decisions --so long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the 
contemporaneous record.  Science & Tech. Corp., B -420216, Jan. 3, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 1 at 8 n.6.  Here, we find that the agency’s post -protest statement  fills in previously 
unrecorded details and provides credible explanations that are consistent with the 
contemporaneous record.   See, e.g. , AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6 
(explaining that the evaluators considered the specific features of Patrona’s management approach proposal but concluded that these features “did not provide  
anticipated value to the Navy beyond the requirements, such as proposing improvements to process efficiency or quality control”) .    Page 11    B-423282   under the personnel approach subfactor.  Protest at 12- 13.  In this regard, Patrona 
makes two general allegations.  First, Patrona argues that the agency failed to consider 
qualifications information for non- key personnel that Patrona included in its staff ing plan.  
Id.  Second, Patrona contends that the Navy did not give Patrona sufficient credit for the 
qualifications of the key personnel it proposed.  Id.   The agency responds that the 
solicitation did not obligate or permit the agency to evaluate the qualification information Patrona elected to include for its proposed non- key personnel.  MOL at 10- 15.  In 
addition, the Navy argues that its evaluation of Patrona’s staffing plan and key personnel was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  Id.   For the reasons 
explained below, we deny this protest ground.  
 By way of background, f or the staffing plan submission, offerors were required to use 
the format provided in RFP attachment 6.1.  RFP at 105;  AR, Exh. 2,  RFP attach. 6.1, 
Staffing P lan.  In this regard, offerors were to provide a “complete labor matrix” that 
“demonstrates an appropriate mix of personnel to accomplish all tasks in the PWS/SOW.”  RFP attach. 6.2 at 1.  Offerors were instructed to use the required format 
to align the proposed mix of personnel with the labor hours identified in RFP section B and RFP attachment 6.2.  RFP at 105; RFP attach. 6.2 at  1.  As relevant here, the 
required format in RFP attachment 6.1 was a Microsoft excel spreadsheet that included columns for the names of proposed personnel, whether the individual is key or non- key, 
the PWS/SOW task area the individual would support, the i ndividual’s proposed labor 
hours, and a final column labeled “notes.”  RFP attach. 6.1.  Finally, the solicitation instructed that when filling out the staffing plan spreadsheet, offerors should “use ‘TBD’ [to be determined]  for non- key positions that do not have identified personnel.”  RFP    
at 105.   
    Non-Key Personnel  
 The protester argues that the solicitation required the agency to assess the individual qualifications and experience information for the non- key personnel identified in 
Patrona’s  staffing plan.  Protest at 12- 13.  Patrona asserts that it “included by name 
nearly 100 non- key incumbent personnel” and included in the “notes” column in the 
staffing plan a “vast amount of information” for its incumbent non- key personnel 
concerning thei r qualifications, certifications, and years of experience.  Id. at 13.  The 
protester contends that had the agency evaluated the qualifications of its non- key 
personnel, Patrona would have received strengths and a “higher rating due to the qualified and experienced individuals ” included in its staffing plan.  Id. at 12- 13. 
 The Navy disagrees, arguing that the solicitation did not contemplate the assessment of individual qualifications for  non-key personnel.  MOL at 10- 13.  The Navy contends that 
Patrona’s interpretation “read[s] an unstated evaluation requirement ” into the solicitation 
and is contradicted by the solicitation’s restriction barring the agency from considering 
non-key personnel resume information.  Id. at 11- 12.  The Navy notes that the 
solicitation did not request qualifications information for non- key personnel, and the 
required format for the staffing plan in RFP attachment 6.1 did not include a column for  
the qualifications for non- key personnel.  Id.  at 11.  Instead, as noted above, the  Page 12    B-423282   offeror’s staffing plan was to include information on whether the employee was key or 
non-key, the labor category, labor hours proposed, and the PWS/SOW task the 
employee would support.  Id. (citing RFP, attach. 6.1).  The solicitation requested this 
information so the Navy could evaluate the extent to which the offerors’ staffing plan addressed  the labor hours identified in RFP section B and confirm that the proposed 
personnel would perform all aspects of the PWS/SOW.  Id. (citing RFP at  114).   
 The Navy maintains that Patrona improperly used the “notes” column of the required labor mix  to insert resume qualifications information for non- key personnel --which the 
solicitation expressly prohibited the agency from considering.  See MOL  at 11- 12 (citing 
RFP attach. 6.2 at 6).  The protester responds that “ [t]he fact that the S olicitation stated 
that the A gency would not evaluate resumes for non- key personnel does not mean that 
the Agency could not consider their qualifications.”  Comments  at 19.   
 When a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of  its provisions.  MSK TriTech Group, LLC , B-421814, Oct. 3, 2023, 2023 
CPD ¶ 235 at 6.  An interpretation is not reasonable if it fails to give meaning to all of a solicitation’s provisions, renders any part of the solicitation absurd or surplus, or creates conflicts.  HumanTouch, LLC , B-419880 et al., Aug. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 283 at 6. 
Here, we find that the agency’s interpretation is reasonable, and the protester’s is not.   
 At the outset,  we note that the relevant  solicitation criterion--requiring the agency to  
evaluate the extent to which the “staffing plan and key personnel [] are qualified, experienced, and suitable for performing the requirements,” see RFP at 114-- appear s to 
suggest the agency was required to evaluate the individual qualifications of all non- key 
personnel identified in an offeror’s staffing plan, as urged by the protester.  This reading, 
however, fails to give effect to the solicitation language as a whole . 
 First, we disagree that the solicitation obligated the agency to evaluate the individual qualifications of non- key personnel that Patrona elected to submit with its staffing plan.  
The RFP instructed that offerors “shall” provide a staffing plan using the format provided in attachment 6.1, staffing plan, and in accordance with attachment 6.2, personnel qualifications.  RFP at 105.  As noted above, this required format did not include a column requesting the input of any qualifications information for non- key personnel.  
See id .  Moreover, the solicitation included a clear statement indicating that “[r]esumes 
submitted for N on-Key Personnel [] will not be evaluated.”   RFP attach. 6.2 at 6.   
 Reading the solicitation as a whole to give effect to all provisions, it is clear that the staffing plan portion of the personnel approach evaluation was intended to assess offerors’ proposed labor mix es for labor category mapping purposes, to ensure the 
staffing plan was aligned with section B, and to confirm that offerors could meet all requirements in the PWS/SOW.  See RFP at 105- 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 1- 3.  
This portion of the evaluation is in contrast with the key personnel evaluation, which, as noted above, involved a request for resumes  for the purpose of  evaluating the specific 
qualifications of nine identified key personnel .  RFP at 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 3- 6.   Page 13    B-423282   Although the sentence in the evaluation criteria, as noted above,  is not a model of 
clarity, it is clear from the solicitation as a whole that  the agency did not intend to 
request, or evaluate, individual qualifications information for the many non- key 
personnel (as opposed to the nine identified key personnel) an offeror could include in 
its staffing plan.  
 Moreover , we find that the vast majority of information Patrona included in the notes 
column for its identified non- key personnel to be, in all practical effect, resume 
information.
11  Faulting the agency for not evaluating individual qualifications information 
for non- personnel that Patrona inserted into the notes column in the staffing plan would 
render extraneous and absurd the solicitation’s prohibition on evaluating resumes for 
non-key personnel.  Cf. HumanTouch, LLC , supra at 6; CACI, Inc. --Fed., B-422774, 
B-422774.2, Oct. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 257.  We thus decline to adopt any 
interpretation that eschews the plain intent of the solicitation to evaluate resume qualifications information for the nine identified key personnel positions only.
12  As a 
result, we see no basis to sustain Patrona’s protest based on the argument that the Navy was obligated to assign strengths or significant strengths to Patrona’s proposal because of alleged superior qualifications of Patrona’s non- key personnel.
13   
 
11 For example, the notes column for non- key personnel in Patrona’s staffing plan 
included such information as the individual’s number of years of professional experience, current position, educational history, professional certifications, and years of experience on the SUBMEPP contract, among other highlighted qualifications, see AR, Exh. 7.2, Patrona Staffing Plan Proposal, which is closely aligned with the information the solicitation requested to be included in resumes for key personnel.  See RFP attach. 6.2 at 6 (requesting “ number of years of professional experience, current 
position/title/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience” ). 
12 To the extent that the protester’s arguments can be read as a challenge to the lack of 
clarity in the solicitation, we note any ambiguity here was apparent from the face of the 
solicitation.  As such, the ambiguity was patent, and any post -award challenge to these  
solicitation terms would be untimely.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1).  
13 We note that the unclear solicitation language at issue here is nearly identical to the 
solicitation language in CACI, Inc. --Fed. , supra, where a protester challenged the 
Navy’s failure to evaluate the qualifications of the awardee’s non- key personnel, which 
the protester argued would have revealed deficiencies in the awardee’s proposal.  Id .  
Our Office found the protester’s argument to be unreasonable given “language in the solicitation that allowed offerors to use unidentified ‘TBD’ employees for non- key 
personnel positions.”  Id . at 11.  As our Office explained, because offerors could 
propose “TBD” for non- key personnel, interpretating the solicitation to require the 
agency to evaluate all non- key personnel qualifications to determine compliance with 
minimum qualifications would “create an absurd situation where the solicitation permitted offerors to submit proposals that would be impossible for the agency to evaluate in accordance with the solicitation.”  Id.    
(continued...)   Page 14    B-423282    
   Key Personnel  
 The protester also argues that the Navy should have assigned Patrona a strength 
because all nine of Patrona’s key personnel met  or exceeded solicitation requirements , 
including meeting or exceeding many of the “desired qualifications” identified in the solicitation .  Protest at  13; Comments at 21- 27.  In particular, the protester asserts that 
the Navy should have assigned a strength for Patrona’s proposed senior technical representative, who Patrona contends exceeds the solicitation’s “desired experience and education criteria” and has over 25 years of experience leading submarine maintenance technical teams for SUBMEPP.  Protest at  13 (citing AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona 
Technical Proposal at 34); Comments at 21- 27.   
 The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably assessed the qualifications represented by Patrona’s proposed key personnel .  MOL at 14.  The evaluators noted 
that Patrona’s proposed key personnel were “suited to perform the requirements, inclusive of the S enior Technical Representative, ” and determined that “the capabilities 
and qualifications of the K ey Personnel are adequate to perform the tasking for which 
they are proposed.”   AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.  In addition, the Navy included a 
declaration from the SSEB chairperson stating that “[t]he SSEB reviewed the key personnel in total for each offeror and found that while some of Patrona’s key personnel met or exceeded some of the desired qualifications, many other s of Patrona’s key 
personnel did not meet or exceed the desired qualifications.”   AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of 
SSEB Chairperson at 7.   As an example, the agency notes that one of the individuals 
proposed for a key personnel position did not have the minimum  desired 10 years of 
supervisory experience, and another did not have a bachelor’s degree in an engineering discipline.  Id.  The Navy explai ns that when deciding whether to assess strengths  
under this subfactor , the evaluators  assessed the “sum total of all personnel” in 
Patrona’s proposal  and determined that the proposed key personnel , in the aggregate,  
“adequately met the requirements,” even if each key personnel  proposed “did not meet 
or exceed all desired qualifications .”  Id.   
 
In response to the Navy’s urging that we adopt a similar position here, Patrona contends that, although the instant solicitation has a comparable provision allowing offerors to submit “TBD” for non -key personnel, see RFP at  105, the same absurd result 
identified in CACI, Inc. --Fed would not arise.  See Comments at  20.  In this regard, 
Patrona does not argue that the solicitation required the agency to disqualify the awardee based on deficiencies in the awardee’s non- key personnel staffing plan but 
instead argues that the agency was required to evaluate t he qualifications of the non-
key personnel Patrona chose to identify in its staffing plan.   See id.  Although we 
acknowledge this distinction, we ultimately conclude that it produces no meaningful difference to the outcome here.  In this regard, reading the solicitation language as a whole and giving effect to all provisions --including the solicitation’s  prohibition on 
evaluating resumes for non- key personnel --we agree with the Navy that the solicitation 
here did not require the agency to assess the qualifications of the non- key personnel 
that Patrona elected to include in its staffing plan proposal.    Page 15    B-423282    
On this record, we can find no basis to sustain Patrona’s protest.   While the protester 
may believe it is entitled to a strength or  strengths because several of its proposed key 
personnel met or exceeded certain desired qualifications , the record shows that the 
agency was aware of both the benefits  and shortcomings  presented by  Patrona’s key 
personnel  proposal  and reasonably  determined that Patrona’s key personnel, overall,  
did not merit a strength.  Although the protester disagrees with the agency’s judgment, the protester has not shown that it was unreasonable for the agency to assess the overall qualifications represented by Patrona’s  key personnel proposal  when deciding 
whether to assign strengths.  See Assessment & Training Sols. Consulting Corp.,        
B-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 177 at 15- 16 (finding protester 
was not entitled to additional strengths for meeting desired qualifications, where the 
agency was aware of the benefits of the protester’s proposal and the protester did not show that the agency’s assignment of strengths was unreasonable) .  Accordingly, these 
allegations are denied.  
 Past Performance  Next, Patrona raises various challenges to the agency’s past performance evaluation.  
Patrona argues that the agency unreasonably failed to consider the relevant past performance of Patrona’s subcontractor on the incumbent project, ICI Services Corporation (ICI).  Patrona also argues that the Navy gave outsized weight to several 
negative performance issues that Patrona experienced on the incumbent contract.  In addition, Patrona contends that the agency unreasonably determined that one of Patrona’s  past per formance references was only “somewhat relevant.”  The protester 
contends that had the Navy not made these errors, Patrona would have been assigned the highest rating of “substantial confidence” instead of the second highest rating of “satisfactory confidence. ”
14  Protest at 13- 17; Comments at 29- 30. 
 The Navy responds that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  The agency argues that it  acted within its discretion to not double count the 
same record of past performance, which reflected the two entities’  (Patrona and ICI)  
performance on the incumbent contract.  The Navy also argues that it reasonably considered Patrona’s performance issues on the incumbent contract, which included staffing shortfalls and alleged falsified timesheets.  Finally, the Navy argues that the evaluators analyzed Patrona’s “reference N o. 2” and reasonably determined that it was 
only somewhat relevant when compared to the scope of this solicitation.  MOL at 15- 18; 
Supp. MOL at  4-6. 
 
14 Patrona also argued initially that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate the past 
performance proposal submitted by KMS.  Protest at 17.  After the agency argued that its evaluation of KMS’s past performance was reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation, the protester failed to address this argument in comments.  See  generally 
Comments.  Accordingly, we dismiss th is allegation as abandoned and do not consider 
it further.  4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr. 12, 2023, 2023 
CPD ¶ 92 at 4 n.3.   Page 16    B-423282    
At the outset, we note that an agency’s evaluation of past performance, including its  consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of an offeror’s performance  history, is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency’s  
assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.  
CrowderGulf, LLC et al. , B-418693.9 et al., Mar. 25, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 90 at 20; 
Metropolitan Interpreters & Translators, Inc ., B-415080.7, B -415080.8, May 14, 2019,  
2019 CPD ¶ 181 at 10.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment does  not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  CrowderGulf, supra at 20.  
Additionally, there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  ENGlobal Gov’t Servs., Inc. , B-419612, B -419612.2, May 14, 2021, 
2021 CPD ¶ 214 at 4- 5. 
 As discussed below, the record here demonstrates that the agency’s past performance evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.   
 First, we find that the Navy reasonably considered the reference Patrona submitted for its subcontractor, ICI, for work ICI performed with Patrona on the incumbent contract.  The record shows that the Navy considered both Patrona’s and ICI’s performance on 
the incumbent contract to be “recent” and “very relevant,” since the efforts on the incumbent contract “involve[] essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and 
complexities this solicitation requires.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 26.  The evaluat ors 
also noted that the reference that Patrona submitted for ICI was the same reference that Patrona submitted for itself as the prime contractor on the incumbent contract.  Id.  The 
evaluators considered this reference, but ultimately concluded that considering this record twice would “not add any additional value to the overall past performance assessment[.]”  Id.  
 The protester argues that the Navy was obligated to give Patrona double credit  for this 
reference, but the solicitation here gave no indication that the agency was required to assign a single past performance reference twice as much weight when the reference was submitted on behalf of both a prime contractor and its subcontractor.  Rather, since the R FP informed offerors that the agency intended to assess “the usefulness of the 
information” when assigning the confidence rating, see RFP at 115, we see no iss ue 
with the Navy’s determination that considering the same reference twice would not add any significant value to the agency’s past performance assessment or its confidence in Patrona’s performance.   
 In addition, Patrona included in its own past performance proposal the following statement:  “ICI’s contributions to the SUBMEPP contract are covered under the P rime 
Contractor [Patrona] CPARS.”  AR, Exh. 7.3, Patrona Past Performance Proposal at 8.  
In this regard, Patrona’s proposal informed the agency that it considered this CPARS to 
cover the performance history of both entities on the incumbent contract.   On this 
record, we find no basis to fault the agency for exercising reasonable discretion to not 
double- count this reference--particularly when Patrona’s own proposal informed the  Page 17    B-423282   Navy that Patrona considered ICI’s contributions  to be “covered under” the record of 
past performance that  Patrona submitted for the incumbent project.  See id.  
 
Second, we find that the Navy reasonably considered and weighed several negative performance issues, along with the positive ratings on Patrona’s CPARS, for the incumbent project.  The record shows that the Navy considered Patrona’s CPARS 
ratings of “very good” and “satisfactory” on the incumbent contract, noting also that performance on the incumbent contract was considered “very relevant” given the “minimal differences between the existing contract and this solicitation.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 23.  However, the Navy identified “two major performance issues” on 
the incumbent contract --both of which, the agency indicated, “significantly decreases 
the Government’s confidence in Patrona being able to successful[ly] execute this 
contract with minimal risk.”  Id.   
 In this regard, the agency’s evaluators explained that after a suspected discrepancy  
reported on a voucher Patrona submitted for the incumbent contract , between the 
observed work hours and the certified hours, the agency conducted an audit confirming that Patrona billed for hours that were not worked.  Id. at 23- 24.  The agency further 
explained that Patrona amended the voucher and removed the inaccurately charged hours, but that this issue nevertheless raised “significant concern with the ability of Patrona to maintain accurate accounting of their work” which “increases the risk of successful contract execution without the presence of fraud, waste or abuse.”  Id. at 24.  
Additionally , the agency identified a persistent issue with “Patrona’s inability to maintain 
staffing levels” consistent with the staffing levels for positions identified in its fixed- price 
tasking.  Id.   In this regard, the evaluators noted that the Navy  endured “periods of 
understaffing while being billed for the entire [fixed- price] amount.”  Id.   The evaluators 
“acknowledged the efforts Patrona was taking to resolve the issue,” but concluded that the “inability of Patrona to adequately staff positions on the contract decreases the level of confidence that Patrona can successfully execute the task ing of this solicitation.”  Id.  
 Patrona argues that “these incidents should not have negatively impacted Patrona’s Past Performance rating, as Patrona took prompt action to rectify these isolated issues.”  
Protest at 16.  In this regard, Patrona argues that the Navy should have given greater weight to Patrona’s explanations in its proposal concerning how it “promptly address ed 
and resolved” those performance issues.  See id. at 15- 16.  Beyond Patrona’s 
disagreement with the Navy’s evaluation judgment, however, Patrona has not provided our Office any basis to question the Navy’s consideration of Patrona’s performance 
issues on this “very relevant” contract.
 15   
 
15 Because we find that the agency reasonably considered these two “major 
performance issues” on Patrona’s “very relevant” incumbent project, AR, Exh. 4, SSEB 
Report  at 23, we see no basis to conclude that the agency would have raised Patrona’s 
past performance rating beyond the second- highest rating of “satisfactory confidence,” 
even if the protester’s other challenges to the past performance evaluation were to be sustained.  See Maywood Closure Co., LLC , B-408343 et al., Aug. 23, 2013, 2013 CPD 
(continued...)   Page 18    B-423282    
Finally, we find that the Navy reasonably assessed Patrona’s “reference N o. 2,” which 
involved Patrona’s program management support for the Navy’s submarine safety and 
quality assurance program office,  as “somewhat relevant.”  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB R eport  
at 24.  Patrona contends that the Navy improperly overlooked the similarities between 
the two projects, arguing that the Navy ignored the many references to relevant sections of the SOW that Patrona included with this past performance reference.  Comments at 29-30.  The Navy argues in response that the solicitation required offerors to include 
“a written explanation describing [] how the work was or is relevant to the work being proposed in this solicitation,” see  RFP, attach. 6.3, but that Patrona only listed “a series 
of SOW citations, without providing any context.”  Supp. MOL at 3.  As a result, the Navy contends that it assessed the information Patrona provided and came to the reasonable conclusion that the pr oject was only “somewhat relevant.”  Id. at 6. 
 We can find no basis to question the agency’s past performance evaluation.  As our 
Office has said repeatedly, an offeror is responsible for submitting a well -written 
proposal with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the procuring a gency.  See  FEDSYNC BEI, LLC,  B-417492, B -417492.2, July 23, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 303 at 10 (finding that  agency reasonably did not credit  a protester’s past 
performance reference that “listed functional requirements of the PWS without any 
explanati on of how the incumbent’s performance of that requirement satisfied the RFP’s 
requirements.”).  Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy’s conclusions about the relevance of this project.   
 In sum, w e see no merit to the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation of 
Patrona’s past performance; as a result, these allegations are denied.  
 Best-Value  Determination 
 As a final matter, the protester argues that the agency’s best -value determination  
was improper because it was based on a flawed evaluation.  Protest at 17.  This allegation is derivative of the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s proposal.  As discussed above, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluat ion of the protester’s proposal.  Accordingly, we dismiss this argument because

record on the whole supported the rating of “satisfactory confidence”).   As a result, on 
this record, we need not address any of the protester’s other past performance 
allegations as  Patrona cannot establish that it w ould be competitively  prejudiced by any 
other alleged error in the agency’s evaluation of Patrona’s past performance.  See id.   Page 19    B-423282   derivative allegations do not establish independent bases of protest.  DirectViz

On September 4, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, NNSA issued the RFQ to holders of the agency’s TEPS III  BPA.  Agency 
Report (AR), Tab 2, RFQ
1; Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law 
(COS/MOL) at 3.  The RFQ  sought a contractor to provide administrative support , 
including  project and budget analysis, document controls, payroll data entry, travel 
voucher processing, invoice tracking, purchase request processing, and technical editing and writing.  COS/MOL at 3.   The RFQ anticipated the issuance of a task order 
with a 1 -year base period, four 1- year option periods, and a 6- month option to extend 
services o n a primarily fixed- price basis with a time- and-materials component for travel.   
RFQ at  13; COS /MOL  at 4. 
 The RFQ provided that the agency intended to issue a task order to the vendor whose quotation represented the best value, considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  technical narrative/approach, staffing approach, key personnel resume, past performance, and price.  RFQ at 61- 68.  The nonprice factors, 
when combined, were significantly more important than price.  Id.  at 61.  The RFQ 
advised vendors that the agency would not issue a task order “at a price premium it consider s disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated non- price 
superiority,” and to the extent quotations were found to be close or similar in merit under the nonprice factors, price was more likely to be determinative.  Id.  at 68.  
 Relevant here, for the key personnel resume factor, vendors were required to provide a resume for the proposed program manager.  RFQ at 63.   The RFQ provided that the 
agency would evaluate the resume to assess whether the individual’s education, 
experience, and security clearance level demonstrated  the individual’s expertise and 
ability to successful ly perform the role in executing the relevant PWS tasks.  Id.   The 
RFQ did not identify any key personnel position other than the program manager.   
 NNSA received four quotations prior to the October 3 submission deadline, and the technical evaluation panel (TEP) determined that  only Harkcon and AMSG submitted 
technically acceptable quotations , leaving the other  vendors ineligible for award .
2  
COS/MOL at 7.   
 
1 The agency issued two amendments to the RFQ.  Amendment 2, issued on 
September 24, 2024, provided the final version of the performance work statement  
(PWS) , instructions, and evaluation criteria, and all citations to the RFQ in this decision 
refer to the version issued with amendment 2.  
2 As discussed further below, Harkcon submitted a quotation as a member of a 
contractor teaming arrangement (CTA).  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  A CTA under  the General Services Administration’s  (GSA)  federal 
supply schedule (FSS)  program  is a written agreement between two or more schedule 
contractors to work together to meet an agency ’s requirements and to maximize a 
vendor ’s competitiveness.  See GSA CTA Guidance, 
(continued...)   Page 3    B-423290; B -423290.2   When NNSA evaluated Harkcon’s quotation, the agency sent Harkcon clarification 
questions concerning its proposed program manager.  First, the agency asked Harkcon to confirm that its proposed program manager would be available on- site at OST 
headquarters, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  
Later, NNSA sent Harkcon a second question, noting that Harkcon proposed to capture 100 percent of the incumbent personnel but proposed a Harkcon employee as the program manager .  AR, Tab 9, Second Clarification at 2.  NNSA asked if Harkcon 
intended to capture the incumbent program manager and utilize its proposed program manager.  Id.   Harkcon responded, in relevant part:  “Harkcon is proposing [our 
employee] as the key person, but could capture the incumbent [program manager] upon award.”  Id.  at 1.   
 The TEP evaluated the quotations submitted by AMSG and Harkcon as follows

 AMSG  Harkcon  
Technical/Narrative Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  
Staffing Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  
Key Personnel Resume  Exceptional  Exceptional  
Past Performance  Pass  Pass  
Price  $11,746,269  $10,498,864  
 COS/MOL at 8.  
 The contracting officer, who was also the source selection official (SSO) reviewed the TEP’s findings for each quotation.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award at 10- 11, 12- 13.  The 
SSO noted that the quotations submitted by Harkcon and AMSG were equally rated under the nonprice factors, and Harkcon offered a price that was nearly 12 percent 
lower than the price offered by AMSG.  Id. at 17.  The SSO found that each vendor has 
“the same very high probability of successful performance” and “none of the unique 
 
www.gsa.gov/contractorteamarrangements.  The CTA details the responsibilities of 
each team member.  Id.  CTAs under GSA schedule contracts differ from traditional 
prime contractor -subcontractor arrangements in that:  (1) each team member has privity 
of contract with the government for the goods or services that it is providing, (2) each team member is responsible for its duties laid out in the CTA document, and (3) each team member must have a GSA schedule contract.   Id.; see also Veterans Healthcare 
Supply Sols., Inc. , B-409888, Sept. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 269 at 4.  Here, Harkcon is a 
member of a CTA, led by MELE Associates, Inc., the TEPS III BPA holder.  See  AR, 
Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 4; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  Harkcon does not hold a BPA.    
3 In evaluating AMSG’s quotation, the agency identified 11 strengths under the technical 
narrative/approach factor, six strengths under the staffing approach factor, and four strengths under the key personnel factor.  COS/MOL at 8.  In evaluating Harkcon’s quotation, the TEP  assigned eight strengths under the technical narrative/approach 
factor, four strengths under the staffing approach factor, and three strengths under the key personnel resume factor.  Id.    Page 4    B-423290; B -423290.2   attributes or strengths of AMSG’s proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an 
additional 11.9 [percent] price premium.”  Id.   The SSO stated that price was the 
“decisive factor,” and she selected Harkcon’s quotation for award.  Id.   
 On January 13, 2025, NNSA issued the task order to Harkcon.  COS/MOL at 15.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of Harkcon’s proposal and the best -value tradeoff decision.  In filing and pursuing this protest, AMSG  
has made arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed below.  While we do not address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester ’s 
arguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest .
4 
 At the outset, we note w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS contractors 
under FAR subpart 8.4, we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation 
is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Technology, Automation 
& Mgmt., Inc., B -418063.3, B -418063.4, Oct. 2, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  343 at 6.   In 
reviewing a protest challenging an agency ’s technical evaluation, our Office will not 
reevaluate the quotations; rather, we will examine the record to determine whether the agency ’s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  TSC Enter., LLC ,

4 For example, the protester  alleges that the agency treated the offerors unequally by 
assigning Harkcon’s quotation a strength for its approach to travel voucher processing and not assigning AMSG’s quotation a strength for an “identical feature” -- [DELETED] .  
Comments & Supp. Protest at 25.  Where a protester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the vendors ’ quotations .  Cloud All., Inc. , B-422884, Dec. 3, 2024, 
2024 CPD ¶  294 at 6.   
Here, contrary to AMSG’s claims, NNSA assigned a strength to Harkcon’s quotation 
because the TEP found that the “ approach . . . demonstrate[ d] a commitment to 
accuracy, efficiency, and responsiveness, ” and the methodology involved “meticulous 
verification” and “prompt resolution.”  AR, Tab 11, Harkcon TEP Report  at 4.  The TEP 
wrote:  “This comprehensive and professional approach enhances the overall travel experience and boosts operational efficiency.”  Id.   The TEP did not assign a strength to 
the awardee’s quotation because it proposed to [DELETED] --as AMSG claims --and the 
protester  has not demonstrated that its quotation included the same features as 
Harkcon’s.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.     Page 5    B-423290; B -423290.2   agency ’s judgment does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Amyx, 
Inc., B-416734.2, Apr. 9, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶  143 at 3.  
 
Availability of Proposed Program Manager    
 The protester alleges that Harkcon either misrepresented the availability of its proposed program manager or engaged in a “ bait and switch”  scheme, and AMSG asserts that 
NNSA should have found Harkon’s quotation ineligible for award.  Protest at 16.  The protester elaborates  that Harkcon has been recruiting for the position since before 
award, Harkcon attempted to recruit the incumbent program manager, and AMSG 
claims  the individual Harkcon proposed as its program manager cannot serve as a full -
time program  manager because he holds three other positions within the company.  
Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 12.   
 The issue of whether personnel identified in a vendor ’s quotation will, in fact, perform 
under the subsequently -awarded contract is generally a matter of contract 
administration that our Office does not review.  DarkStar Intelligence, LLC , B-420609, 
B-420609.2, June 24, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 153 at 6; see also 4 C.F.R. § 21.5(a).  
Nonetheless, our Office will consider allegations that an offeror proposed personnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to provide during contract performance in order t o obtain a more favorable evaluation, as such a material misrepresentation has 
an adverse effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system.  DarkStar 
Intelligence, supra.   Our decisions refer to such circumstances as a “ bait and switch. ”  
Id.  To establish an impermissible bait and switch, a protester must show that:  (1) the 
awardee either knowingly or negligently represented that it would rely on specific 
personnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to furnish during contract performance; (2) the misrepresentation was relied on by the agency; and (3) the 
agency ’s reliance had a material effect on the evaluation results.   Id.  
 On this record, we find that AMSG has not established that Harkcon engaged in an impermissible bait and switch.   As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that Harkcon’s 
recruiting efforts mandate the conclusion that Harkcon proposed a program manager that it did not intend to use.  For one,  as noted above, in its quotation Harkcon proposed 
to capture the incumbent personnel --including the program manager.  AR, Tab 9, 
Second Clarification at 1- 2.  As such, engagement with the incumbent program 
manager is c onsistent with Harkcon’s proposed approach and provides no basis to 
accept the protester’s allegation that Harkcon made a misrepresentation.

Intelligence, supra.          
 
 
5 Additionally, our Office has found that the mere fact that an awardee recruited 
incumbent personnel  after award does not establish that the proposed personnel are 
unavailable to perform ; it is neither unusual nor inherently improper for an awardee to 
recruit and hire personnel previously employed by an incumbent contractor.   AT&T 
Gov’t Sols., Inc. , B-406926 et al. , Oct. 2, 2012, 2013 CPD ¶ 88 at  15.  Page 6    B-423290; B -423290.2   In addition, while AMSG has provided our Office with a Harkcon job posting seeking a 
project manager to support a Department of Energy contract, evidence of recruitment 
efforts does not establish a knowing or negligent representation by Harkcon that it planned to rely on a specific program manager that it did not expect to furnish during performance.  See ICF Inc., L.L.C. , B-419049.3, B -419049.4, Mar ch 9, 2021, 2021 CPD 
¶ 117 at 8- 9.  Accordingly, the protester  has not provided any reasonable evidence to 
support its misrepresentation allegations.   We are also not persuaded by AMSG’s argument that the proposed program manager 
is unavailable to perform because he holds other positions within Harkcon.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 9.  The record shows that the agency asked Harkcon whether its 
proposed program manager would be available on site and in accordance with the PWS requirements, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  There is no credible evidence in the record that challenges the veracity of Harkcon’s 
quotation or its responses to the agency’s clarification request.   
 As there has been no showing by AMSG  of a material misrepresentation by Harkcon 
concerning its proposed program manager , we deny this protest ground.  
 Failure to Propose an Alternate P rogram Manager  
 AMSG also contends that Harkcon failed to propose an alternate program manager ; its 
quotation took exception to the requirement ; and its quotation should have been 
declared unacceptable.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 15; Supp. Comments at 13- 14.  
NNSA responds that the RFQ did not require vendors to identify an alternate program 
manager in their quotations.  Supp. MOL at 7.  
 Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s requirements, we begin by examining the 
plain language of the solicitation.  Point Blank Enters., Inc. , B‑411839, B ‑411839.2, 
Nov. 4, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 345 at 4.  We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation 
by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; 
to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a 
reading.  Desbuild Inc. , B‑413613.2, Jan. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 23 at 5.  If the 
solicitation language is unambiguous our inquiry ceases .  Id. 
 
Here, as noted above, the RFQ identified one key personnel position:  program manager.  RFQ at 63.  AMSG  contends that vendors were also required to identify an 
alternate program manager because PWS section 1.5.12, K ey Personnel, provided:  
 
The following personnel are considered key personnel by the government: 
Program Manager.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who 
shall be responsible for the performance of the work.  The name of this person and an alternate who shall act for t he Contractor when the 
manager is absent shall be designated in writing to the [contracting 
officer].  The Program Manager or alternate shall have full authority to act  Page 7    B-423290; B -423290.2   for the Contractor on all contract matters relating to daily operation of this 
contract.  
 Id. at 15.   
 We find the RFQ to be  unambiguous, and we disagree with AMSG ’s interpretation that 
vendors were required to identify an alternate program manager  in their quotations .  
The RFQ  required vendors to identify a proposed program manager and provide a 
resume for that individual.  Id.  at 63.  The RFQ provided that the agency would evaluate 
that single resume.  Id.  Neither the RFQ’s submission instructions nor the evaluation 
criteria referenced an “alternate program manager.”  Rather, the PWS established a post-award requirement to identify an alternate program manager during performance.  
Vendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotation submissions.  In sum, nothing in the RFQ required  vendors to identify an alternate 
program manager in their quotations; the PWS established a post -award requirement  to 
identify an alternate program manager .   
 AMSG contends that even if vendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotations, Harkcon took exception to the solicitation’s performance 
requirements  by including the following statement in its quotation:   “Harkcon’s Program 
Manager (PM), backed by Harkcon’s dedicated [Department of Energy]/NNSA Program Management Office (PMO), will be the singular touch point for all facets of work performed on the contract regardless of the Team Harkcon member/entity per forming 
the work.”  Supp. Comments at 13 ( quoting AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Q uotation at 8).  The 
protester argues that by using the phrase “singular touch point,” Harkcon’s quotation 
foreclosed the possibili ty that any other Harkcon employee could act on the company’s 
behalf --a violation of the requirement to have an alternate program manager.  Id.   
 
A proposal or quotation that takes exception to a solicitation’ s material terms and 
conditions should be considered unacceptable and may not form the basis for an award.

CPD ¶ 18 at 4; Deloitte Consulting LLP , B-417988.2 et al. , March  23, 2020, 2020 CPD

Inc., B-409981, B -409981.2, Oct. 3, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶  284 at 11.  In determining the 
technical acceptability of a proposal or quotation, an agency may not accept at face value a promise to meet a material requirement, where there is significant countervailing evidence that was, or should have been, reasonably known to the agency that should create doubt whether the offeror or vendor will or can comply with that requirement.   
Innovative Mgmt., supra.  
 Here, we find no basis to sustain AMSG’s protest based on the argument that  Harkcon’ s 
quotation took exception t o the PWS’s requirement to identify an alternate program 
manager .  The statement  in Harkcon’s quotation that AMSG  identifies does not conflict  
with the PWS’s  requirement for the contractor to designate an alternate program 
manager .  In this respect, we agree with the agency that stating the program manager  Page 8    B-423290; B -423290.2   would serve as the “singular touch point”  for communications with the agency --
regardless of the entity performing the work --does not mean Harkcon would fail to 
appoint an alternate program manager with full authority to act on the company’s behalf.  
Supp. MOL at 8.  Furthermore, AMSG does not point to any other language in Harkcon’s quotation to support its assertion that Harkcon took exception to the requirement to designate an alternate program manager.  We deny this protest.  
 Noncompliant CTA 
 The protester contends that the awardee was ineligible for award because Har kcon  
does not hold a TEPS III BPA.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments 
at 23- 25.  In this regard and as noted above, Harkcon submitted its quotation as a 
member of a CTA  relying on MELE’s BPA  as the basis authorizing Harkcon to submit a 
quotation.
6  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments at 23- 25.  NNSA 
responds that Harkcon was eligible for award because any CTA member may submit a quotation and lead an order issued under the BPA.   See Supp. MOL at 13; Supp. COS 
at 3; AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2, 4.   
 We have reviewed the record and deny this argument.  The TEPS III BPA ordering guide provides that BPA ’s were established with CTA leaders, and both the CTA 
leaders and CTA members have privity of contract with the government  as a result of 
the CTA members’ FSS contracts .  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 4.  The 
ordering guide states:   
 
The Government will have privity of contract with each business within the 
teams --allowing the government to engage small businesses directly 
rather than just through the CTA Leader or Order Lead under a standard 
teaming program.  For Task Order awards, the Team Leaders will select 
an Order Lead.  Orders will be issued directly against the Order Lead’s 
[FSS]  contract.  
 Id.  Additionally, the TEPS III BPA ordering guide and MELE’s TEPS III BPA each 
provide that BPA’s would not be established with CTA members.  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2 (“The CTA members will not be awarded their own BPA[’]s.”); 
 
6 Additionally, AMSG contends that Harkcon’s quotation was ineligible for award 
because Harkcon’s quotation utilized the rates and labor categories from Harkcon’s FSS contract, and those labor categories are absent from the FSS contracts held by MELE and another team member.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 34- 35.  The 
protester’s allegation appears to be premised on the notion that MELE and the other firm were proposed as CTA members ; and as discussed above, under the FSS program 
prime contractors in their own right .  However, the record establishes that MELE and 
the other firm were proposed as subcontractors, and the MELE BPA authorized CTA leaders and members to perform as subcontractors.  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; AR, Tab 16 MELE BPA at 6.  Consequently,  there was nothing improper in 
Harkcon using the rates and labor categories from its FSS contract in its quotation.     Page 9    B-423290; B -423290.2   AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 (same).  Furthermore, Harkcon is identified as a team 
member in MELE’s TEPS III BPA, and the BPA provides that CTA members will be 
issued task orders under their respective FSS contracts when they act as an order leader .  AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 -5.  Accordingly, the protester’s assertion that 
Harkcon was ineligible for award because it is not a BPA holder is contradicted by the TEPS III BPA ordering guid e and the BPA.   
 The protester also claims that even if a CTA member could be eligible for award, 
Harkcon was ineligible because Harkcon did not sign the BPA and therefore did not have privity of contract with the agency.  Protester Supp. Briefing at 3- 4.  We reject this 
argument because sig ning the BPA is irrelevant to the question of privity; a BPA is not a 
contract.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. v. United States , 741 F.3d 1380, 1382- 83 
(Fed. Cir.  2014).  Rather, BPA’s  are “frameworks for future contracts --'a set of  grounds 
rules as it were, and no obligations are assumed by either party until orders are given by the Government and accepted by the contractor. ’”  Id. at 1381 ( quoting Modern Sys. 
Tech. Corp. v. United States , 979 F.2d 200, 204 (Fed. Cir. 1992)) .  It is undisputed that  
Harkcon holds an  FSS contract, and an FSS contract establishes  privity of contract with 
the government.   See Roche Diagnostics Corp. , B-419510, B -419510.2, Apr. 16, 2021, 
2021 CPD ¶ 173 at 5 n.1 (stating members of a CTA are in privity of contract with the government as a result of the members’ FSS contracts).   As such, AMSG’s arguments 
concerning Harkcon’s alleged failure to sign the BPA are not persuasive.   On this record, we reject the protester’s argument that Harkcon’s quotation was ineligible for award because MELE, the CTA leader, held the BPA instead of Harkcon.        
 
Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Finally, AMSG challenges the best -value tradeoff decision, complaining the decision 
was based on a flawed evaluation, and the SSO failed to consider the substantive differences between the vendors’ quotations.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 36- 39; 
Supp. Comments at 2 6-28.  With respect to the latter argument, t he protester 
elaborates:  “ the [SSO]  never even acknowledged, much less substantively discussed, 
AMSG ’s six more strengths than Harkcon, much less explained why those six strengths, 
individually and col lectively, do not make AMSG technically superior. ”  Comments & 
Supp. Protest at  38.  NNSA replies that the SSO “considered the unique attributes of 
each quotation and reached a well -supported best value determination.”  COS/MOL 
at 22.  
 Where, as here, a procurement conducted pursuant to FAR subpart 8.4 provides for issuance of a task order on a “ best-value”  tradeoff basis, it is the function of the source 
selection authority  to perform a price/technical tradeoff, that is, to determine whether 
one quotation’ s technical superiority is worth its higher price.  Spatial Front, Inc. , 
B-422058.2, B -422058.3, May 21, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 120 at 14.  Even where a 
solicitation issued under FAR subpart 8.4 emphasizes technical merit over price, an agenc y properly may select a lower -priced, lower -rated quotation if the agency 
reasonably concludes that the price premium involved in selecting a higher -rated,  Page 10    B-423290; B -423290.2   higher -priced quotation is not justified in light of the acceptable level of technical 
competence available at a lower price.  Id.; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, 
B-422823.2, Nov.  18, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 272 at 8.   The extent to which technical 
superiority is traded for a lower price is governed only by the test of rationality and 
consistency with the stated evaluation criteria.  Spatial Front, supra; Booz Allen 
Hamilton, supra.   
 Additionally , there is no need for extensive documentation of every consideration 
factored into a tradeoff decision.  Alethix LLC , B-420920.3, B -420920.4, Dec. 15, 2022, 
2022 CPD ¶ 316 at 10.  Rather, the documentation need only be sufficient to establish 
that the agency was aware of the relative merits and costs of the competing quotations and that the source selection was reasonably based.  Id. 
 First, we reject AMSG’s protest of the agency ’s best -value tradeoff decision based on its 
challenges to the underlying evaluation.   Comments & Supp. Protest at 37- 38.  This 
assertion is derivative of AMSG’s  various complaints that we have rejected.   CORE 
O’Ahu, LLC , B-421714, B -421714.2, Aug. 31, 2023 , 2023 CPD ¶ 212 at 11.  
 Furthermore, the record here does not support the protester’s contention that the SSO failed to consider the substantive differences between the vendors’ quotations.  The award decision included  a detailed discussion of the evaluators’ findings for each 
quotation under each factor.  For example, for the technical narrative/approach factor, the TEP noted AMSG’s “ [DELETED] .”  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award  at 10.  The TEP also 
noted AMSG’s use of a [DELETED] .  Id.  The award decision includes a similar 
discussion  of AMSG’s quotation under the other factors.
7  Id. at 11.   After discussing the 
evaluation findings for each quotation, the SSO wrote:  
 
Harkcon’s quotation offered the best value to the government, providing 
the required services at a $1,247,405.00, or 11.9 [percent], lower price 
than AMSG while ensuring the same very high probability of successful 
performance.  While Harkcon’s and AMSG’s quotations each had unique 
attributes under the non- price factors, none of the unique attributes or 
strengths of AMSG's proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an 
additional 11.9 [percent] price premium.  
 Id. at 17.    
 
In light of the contemporaneous record, we see no basis to conclude that the agency did 
not adequately consider the technical benefits of AMSG’s quotation.  The SSO made a 
business decision that the advantages in the protester’s quotation did not justify the 
associated price premium , and the SSO’s reasoning was consistent with the RFQ’s 
 
7 In addition to discussing specific aspects of the vendors’ quotations, the SSO 
concurred with and adopted the TEP’s assessments of strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies, as well as the adjectival ratings assigned to each quotation.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of  Award at 10.    Page 11    B-423290; B -423290.2   statement that the agency would not pay “a price premium it considers disproportionate 
to the benefits associated with the evaluated non- price superiority.”  RFQ at 68.  O ur 
Office has consistently concluded that a source selection official may reasonably select 
a lower priced, lower technically rated quotation, even where price is the least important  
facto r.  Spatial Front, supra; Booz Allen Hamilton, supra.  Here, the protester simply 
disagrees with the agency ’s business judgment, and such disagreement provides no 
basis to sustain the protest.8 
 The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez

8 To the extent the protester asserts that the SSO was required to specifically address 
each strength that the TEP identified in the vendors’ quotations, the argument lacks merit because a procuring agency is not required to document every consideration that factored into the tradeoff decision.  Alethix LLC, supra.  Here, the SSO discussed several of the strengths identified in each quotation, and the SSO stated that she independently reviewed and adopted the TEP’s findings.

DECISION  
 Advanced Management Strategies Group, Inc. (AMSG), a service- disabled veteran-
owned small business (SDVOSB) of Dumfries, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task 
order to Harkcon, Inc., an SDVOSB of Fredericksburg, Virginia, under request for 
quotations (RFQ) No. 89233122QNA000226, issued by the Department of Energy, 
National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  under the agency’s technical, 
engineering, and programmatic services (TEPS III) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) .  
The RFQ sought administrative support services for the Office of Secure Transportation 
(OST).  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of vendors’  
quotations, as well as the best -value tradeoff decision.    
 
We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order. This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423290; B -423290.2   BACKGROUND  
 
On September 4, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, NNSA issued the RFQ to holders of the agency’s TEPS III  BPA.  Agency 
Report (AR), Tab 2, RFQ
1; Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law 
(COS/MOL) at 3.  The RFQ  sought a contractor to provide administrative support , 
including  project and budget analysis, document controls, payroll data entry, travel 
voucher processing, invoice tracking, purchase request processing, and technical editing and writing.  COS/MOL at 3.   The RFQ anticipated the issuance of a task order 
with a 1 -year base period, four 1- year option periods, and a 6- month option to extend 
services o n a primarily fixed- price basis with a time- and-materials component for travel.   
RFQ at  13; COS /MOL  at 4. 
 The RFQ provided that the agency intended to issue a task order to the vendor whose quotation represented the best value, considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  technical narrative/approach, staffing approach, key personnel resume, past performance, and price.  RFQ at 61- 68.  The nonprice factors, 
when combined, were significantly more important than price.  Id.  at 61.  The RFQ 
advised vendors that the agency would not issue a task order “at a price premium it consider s disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated non- price 
superiority,” and to the extent quotations were found to be close or similar in merit under the nonprice factors, price was more likely to be determinative.  Id.  at 68.  
 Relevant here, for the key personnel resume factor, vendors were required to provide a resume for the proposed program manager.  RFQ at 63.   The RFQ provided that the 
agency would evaluate the resume to assess whether the individual’s education, 
experience, and security clearance level demonstrated  the individual’s expertise and 
ability to successful ly perform the role in executing the relevant PWS tasks.  Id.   The 
RFQ did not identify any key personnel position other than the program manager.   
 NNSA received four quotations prior to the October 3 submission deadline, and the technical evaluation panel (TEP) determined that  only Harkcon and AMSG submitted 
technically acceptable quotations , leaving the other  vendors ineligible for award .
2  
COS/MOL at 7.   
 
1 The agency issued two amendments to the RFQ.  Amendment 2, issued on 
September 24, 2024, provided the final version of the performance work statement  
(PWS) , instructions, and evaluation criteria, and all citations to the RFQ in this decision 
refer to the version issued with amendment 2.  
2 As discussed further below, Harkcon submitted a quotation as a member of a 
contractor teaming arrangement (CTA).  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  A CTA under  the General Services Administration’s  (GSA)  federal 
supply schedule (FSS)  program  is a written agreement between two or more schedule 
contractors to work together to meet an agency ’s requirements and to maximize a 
vendor ’s competitiveness.  See GSA CTA Guidance, 
(continued...)   Page 3    B-423290; B -423290.2   When NNSA evaluated Harkcon’s quotation, the agency sent Harkcon clarification 
questions concerning its proposed program manager.  First, the agency asked Harkcon to confirm that its proposed program manager would be available on- site at OST 
headquarters, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  
Later, NNSA sent Harkcon a second question, noting that Harkcon proposed to capture 100 percent of the incumbent personnel but proposed a Harkcon employee as the program manager .  AR, Tab 9, Second Clarification at 2.  NNSA asked if Harkcon 
intended to capture the incumbent program manager and utilize its proposed program manager.  Id.   Harkcon responded, in relevant part:  “Harkcon is proposing [our 
employee] as the key person, but could capture the incumbent [program manager] upon award.”  Id.  at 1.   
 The TEP evaluated the quotations submitted by AMSG and Harkcon as follows
3: 
 
 AMSG  Harkcon  
Technical/Narrative Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  
Staffing Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  
Key Personnel Resume  Exceptional  Exceptional  
Past Performance  Pass  Pass  
Price  $11,746,269  $10,498,864  
 COS/MOL at 8.  
 The contracting officer, who was also the source selection official (SSO) reviewed the TEP’s findings for each quotation.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award at 10- 11, 12- 13.  The 
SSO noted that the quotations submitted by Harkcon and AMSG were equally rated under the nonprice factors, and Harkcon offered a price that was nearly 12 percent 
lower than the price offered by AMSG.  Id. at 17.  The SSO found that each vendor has 
“the same very high probability of successful performance” and “none of the unique 
 
www.gsa.gov/contractorteamarrangements.  The CTA details the responsibilities of 
each team member.  Id.  CTAs under GSA schedule contracts differ from traditional 
prime contractor -subcontractor arrangements in that:  (1) each team member has privity 
of contract with the government for the goods or services that it is providing, (2) each team member is responsible for its duties laid out in the CTA document, and (3) each team member must have a GSA schedule contract.   Id.; see also Veterans Healthcare 
Supply Sols., Inc. , B-409888, Sept. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 269 at 4.  Here, Harkcon is a 
member of a CTA, led by MELE Associates, Inc., the TEPS III BPA holder.  See  AR, 
Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 4; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  Harkcon does not hold a BPA.    
3 In evaluating AMSG’s quotation, the agency identified 11 strengths under the technical 
narrative/approach factor, six strengths under the staffing approach factor, and four strengths under the key personnel factor.  COS/MOL at 8.  In evaluating Harkcon’s quotation, the TEP  assigned eight strengths under the technical narrative/approach 
factor, four strengths under the staffing approach factor, and three strengths under the key personnel resume factor.  Id.    Page 4    B-423290; B -423290.2   attributes or strengths of AMSG’s proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an 
additional 11.9 [percent] price premium.”  Id.   The SSO stated that price was the 
“decisive factor,” and she selected Harkcon’s quotation for award.  Id.   
 On January 13, 2025, NNSA issued the task order to Harkcon.  COS/MOL at 15.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of Harkcon’s proposal and the best -value tradeoff decision.  In filing and pursuing this protest, AMSG  
has made arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed below.  While we do not address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester ’s 
arguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest .
4 
 At the outset, we note w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS contractors 
under FAR subpart 8.4, we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation 
is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Technology, Automation 
& Mgmt., Inc., B -418063.3, B -418063.4, Oct. 2, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  343 at 6.   In 
reviewing a protest challenging an agency ’s technical evaluation, our Office will not 
reevaluate the quotations; rather, we will examine the record to determine whether the agency ’s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  TSC Enter., LLC , 
B-415731, Feb. 8, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 71 at 2.  A protester ’s disagreement with the 
 
4 For example, the protester  alleges that the agency treated the offerors unequally by 
assigning Harkcon’s quotation a strength for its approach to travel voucher processing and not assigning AMSG’s quotation a strength for an “identical feature” -- [DELETED] .  
Comments & Supp. Protest at 25.  Where a protester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the vendors ’ quotations .  Cloud All., Inc. , B-422884, Dec. 3, 2024, 
2024 CPD ¶  294 at 6.   
Here, contrary to AMSG’s claims, NNSA assigned a strength to Harkcon’s quotation 
because the TEP found that the “ approach . . . demonstrate[ d] a commitment to 
accuracy, efficiency, and responsiveness, ” and the methodology involved “meticulous 
verification” and “prompt resolution.”  AR, Tab 11, Harkcon TEP Report  at 4.  The TEP 
wrote:  “This comprehensive and professional approach enhances the overall travel experience and boosts operational efficiency.”  Id.   The TEP did not assign a strength to 
the awardee’s quotation because it proposed to [DELETED] --as AMSG claims --and the 
protester  has not demonstrated that its quotation included the same features as 
Harkcon’s.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.     Page 5    B-423290; B -423290.2   agency ’s judgment does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Amyx, 
Inc., B-416734.2, Apr. 9, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶  143 at 3.  
 
Availability of Proposed Program Manager    
 The protester alleges that Harkcon either misrepresented the availability of its proposed program manager or engaged in a “ bait and switch”  scheme, and AMSG asserts that 
NNSA should have found Harkon’s quotation ineligible for award.  Protest at 16.  The protester elaborates  that Harkcon has been recruiting for the position since before 
award, Harkcon attempted to recruit the incumbent program manager, and AMSG 
claims  the individual Harkcon proposed as its program manager cannot serve as a full -
time program  manager because he holds three other positions within the company.  
Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 12.   
 The issue of whether personnel identified in a vendor ’s quotation will, in fact, perform 
under the subsequently -awarded contract is generally a matter of contract 
administration that our Office does not review.  DarkStar Intelligence, LLC , B-420609, 
B-420609.2, June 24, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 153 at 6; see also 4 C.F.R. § 21.5(a).  
Nonetheless, our Office will consider allegations that an offeror proposed personnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to provide during contract performance in order t o obtain a more favorable evaluation, as such a material misrepresentation has 
an adverse effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system.  DarkStar 
Intelligence, supra.   Our decisions refer to such circumstances as a “ bait and switch. ”  
Id.  To establish an impermissible bait and switch, a protester must show that:  (1) the 
awardee either knowingly or negligently represented that it would rely on specific 
personnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to furnish during contract performance; (2) the misrepresentation was relied on by the agency; and (3) the 
agency ’s reliance had a material effect on the evaluation results.   Id.  
 On this record, we find that AMSG has not established that Harkcon engaged in an impermissible bait and switch.   As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that Harkcon’s 
recruiting efforts mandate the conclusion that Harkcon proposed a program manager that it did not intend to use.  For one,  as noted above, in its quotation Harkcon proposed 
to capture the incumbent personnel --including the program manager.  AR, Tab 9, 
Second Clarification at 1- 2.  As such, engagement with the incumbent program 
manager is c onsistent with Harkcon’s proposed approach and provides no basis to 
accept the protester’s allegation that Harkcon made a misrepresentation.

Intelligence, supra.          
 
 
5 Additionally, our Office has found that the mere fact that an awardee recruited 
incumbent personnel  after award does not establish that the proposed personnel are 
unavailable to perform ; it is neither unusual nor inherently improper for an awardee to 
recruit and hire personnel previously employed by an incumbent contractor.   AT&T 
Gov’t Sols., Inc. , B-406926 et al. , Oct. 2, 2012, 2013 CPD ¶ 88 at  15.  Page 6    B-423290; B -423290.2   In addition, while AMSG has provided our Office with a Harkcon job posting seeking a 
project manager to support a Department of Energy contract, evidence of recruitment 
efforts does not establish a knowing or negligent representation by Harkcon that it planned to rely on a specific program manager that it did not expect to furnish during performance.  See ICF Inc., L.L.C. , B-419049.3, B -419049.4, Mar ch 9, 2021, 2021 CPD 
¶ 117 at 8- 9.  Accordingly, the protester  has not provided any reasonable evidence to 
support its misrepresentation allegations.   We are also not persuaded by AMSG’s argument that the proposed program manager 
is unavailable to perform because he holds other positions within Harkcon.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 9.  The record shows that the agency asked Harkcon whether its 
proposed program manager would be available on site and in accordance with the PWS requirements, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  There is no credible evidence in the record that challenges the veracity of Harkcon’s 
quotation or its responses to the agency’s clarification request.   
 As there has been no showing by AMSG  of a material misrepresentation by Harkcon 
concerning its proposed program manager , we deny this protest ground.  
 Failure to Propose an Alternate P rogram Manager  
 AMSG also contends that Harkcon failed to propose an alternate program manager ; its 
quotation took exception to the requirement ; and its quotation should have been 
declared unacceptable.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 15; Supp. Comments at 13- 14.  
NNSA responds that the RFQ did not require vendors to identify an alternate program 
manager in their quotations.  Supp. MOL at 7.  
 Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s requirements, we begin by examining the 
plain language of the solicitation.  Point Blank Enters., Inc. , B‑411839, B ‑411839.2, 
Nov. 4, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 345 at 4.  We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation 
by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; 
to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a 
reading.  Desbuild Inc. , B‑413613.2, Jan. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 23 at 5.  If the 
solicitation language is unambiguous our inquiry ceases .  Id. 
 
Here, as noted above, the RFQ identified one key personnel position:  program manager.  RFQ at 63.  AMSG  contends that vendors were also required to identify an 
alternate program manager because PWS section 1.5.12, K ey Personnel, provided:  
 
The following personnel are considered key personnel by the government: 
Program Manager.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who 
shall be responsible for the performance of the work.  The name of this person and an alternate who shall act for t he Contractor when the 
manager is absent shall be designated in writing to the [contracting 
officer].  The Program Manager or alternate shall have full authority to act  Page 7    B-423290; B -423290.2   for the Contractor on all contract matters relating to daily operation of this 
contract.  
 Id. at 15.   
 We find the RFQ to be  unambiguous, and we disagree with AMSG ’s interpretation that 
vendors were required to identify an alternate program manager  in their quotations .  
The RFQ  required vendors to identify a proposed program manager and provide a 
resume for that individual.  Id.  at 63.  The RFQ provided that the agency would evaluate 
that single resume.  Id.  Neither the RFQ’s submission instructions nor the evaluation 
criteria referenced an “alternate program manager.”  Rather, the PWS established a post-award requirement to identify an alternate program manager during performance.  
Vendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotation submissions.  In sum, nothing in the RFQ required  vendors to identify an alternate 
program manager in their quotations; the PWS established a post -award requirement  to 
identify an alternate program manager .   
 AMSG contends that even if vendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotations, Harkcon took exception to the solicitation’s performance 
requirements  by including the following statement in its quotation:   “Harkcon’s Program 
Manager (PM), backed by Harkcon’s dedicated [Department of Energy]/NNSA Program Management Office (PMO), will be the singular touch point for all facets of work performed on the contract regardless of the Team Harkcon member/entity per forming 
the work.”  Supp. Comments at 13 ( quoting AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Q uotation at 8).  The 
protester argues that by using the phrase “singular touch point,” Harkcon’s quotation 
foreclosed the possibili ty that any other Harkcon employee could act on the company’s 
behalf --a violation of the requirement to have an alternate program manager.  Id.   
 
A proposal or quotation that takes exception to a solicitation’ s material terms and 
conditions should be considered unacceptable and may not form the basis for an award.   
Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches , B-418823.3, B -418823.4, Jan. 8, 2021, 2021 
CPD ¶ 18 at 4; Deloitte Consulting LLP , B-417988.2 et al. , March  23, 2020, 2020 CPD 
¶ 128 at 6.   Material terms of a solicitation include those which affect the price, quantity, 
quality, or delivery of the goods or services being provided.  Arrington Dixon & As socs., 
Inc., B-409981, B -409981.2, Oct. 3, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶  284 at 11.  In determining the 
technical acceptability of a proposal or quotation, an agency may not accept at face value a promise to meet a material requirement, where there is significant countervailing evidence that was, or should have been, reasonably known to the agency that should create doubt whether the offeror or vendor will or can comply with that requirement.   
Innovative Mgmt., supra.  
 Here, we find no basis to sustain AMSG’s protest based on the argument that  Harkcon’ s 
quotation took exception t o the PWS’s requirement to identify an alternate program 
manager .  The statement  in Harkcon’s quotation that AMSG  identifies does not conflict  
with the PWS’s  requirement for the contractor to designate an alternate program 
manager .  In this respect, we agree with the agency that stating the program manager  Page 8    B-423290; B -423290.2   would serve as the “singular touch point”  for communications with the agency --
regardless of the entity performing the work --does not mean Harkcon would fail to 
appoint an alternate program manager with full authority to act on the company’s behalf.  
Supp. MOL at 8.  Furthermore, AMSG does not point to any other language in Harkcon’s quotation to support its assertion that Harkcon took exception to the requirement to designate an alternate program manager.  We deny this protest.  
 Noncompliant CTA 
 The protester contends that the awardee was ineligible for award because Har kcon  
does not hold a TEPS III BPA.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments 
at 23- 25.  In this regard and as noted above, Harkcon submitted its quotation as a 
member of a CTA  relying on MELE’s BPA  as the basis authorizing Harkcon to submit a 
quotation.
6  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments at 23- 25.  NNSA 
responds that Harkcon was eligible for award because any CTA member may submit a quotation and lead an order issued under the BPA.   See Supp. MOL at 13; Supp. COS 
at 3; AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2, 4.   
 We have reviewed the record and deny this argument.  The TEPS III BPA ordering guide provides that BPA ’s were established with CTA leaders, and both the CTA 
leaders and CTA members have privity of contract with the government  as a result of 
the CTA members’ FSS contracts .  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 4.  The 
ordering guide states:   
 
The Government will have privity of contract with each business within the 
teams --allowing the government to engage small businesses directly 
rather than just through the CTA Leader or Order Lead under a standard 
teaming program.  For Task Order awards, the Team Leaders will select 
an Order Lead.  Orders will be issued directly against the Order Lead’s 
[FSS]  contract.  
 Id.  Additionally, the TEPS III BPA ordering guide and MELE’s TEPS III BPA each 
provide that BPA’s would not be established with CTA members.  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2 (“The CTA members will not be awarded their own BPA[’]s.”); 
 
6 Additionally, AMSG contends that Harkcon’s quotation was ineligible for award 
because Harkcon’s quotation utilized the rates and labor categories from Harkcon’s FSS contract, and those labor categories are absent from the FSS contracts held by MELE and another team member.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 34- 35.  The 
protester’s allegation appears to be premised on the notion that MELE and the other firm were proposed as CTA members ; and as discussed above, under the FSS program 
prime contractors in their own right .  However, the record establishes that MELE and 
the other firm were proposed as subcontractors, and the MELE BPA authorized CTA leaders and members to perform as subcontractors.  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; AR, Tab 16 MELE BPA at 6.  Consequently,  there was nothing improper in 
Harkcon using the rates and labor categories from its FSS contract in its quotation.     Page 9    B-423290; B -423290.2   AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 (same).  Furthermore, Harkcon is identified as a team 
member in MELE’s TEPS III BPA, and the BPA provides that CTA members will be 
issued task orders under their respective FSS contracts when they act as an order leader .  AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 -5.  Accordingly, the protester’s assertion that 
Harkcon was ineligible for award because it is not a BPA holder is contradicted by the TEPS III BPA ordering guid e and the BPA.   
 The protester also claims that even if a CTA member could be eligible for award, 
Harkcon was ineligible because Harkcon did not sign the BPA and therefore did not have privity of contract with the agency.  Protester Supp. Briefing at 3- 4.  We reject this 
argument because sig ning the BPA is irrelevant to the question of privity; a BPA is not a 
contract.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. v. United States , 741 F.3d 1380, 1382- 83 
(Fed. Cir.  2014).  Rather, BPA’s  are “frameworks for future contracts --'a set of  grounds 
rules as it were, and no obligations are assumed by either party until orders are given by the Government and accepted by the contractor. ’”  Id. at 1381 ( quoting Modern Sys. 
Tech. Corp. v. United States , 979 F.2d 200, 204 (Fed. Cir. 1992)) .  It is undisputed that  
Harkcon holds an  FSS contract, and an FSS contract establishes  privity of contract with 
the government.   See Roche Diagnostics Corp. , B-419510, B -419510.2, Apr. 16, 2021, 
2021 CPD ¶ 173 at 5 n.1 (stating members of a CTA are in privity of contract with the government as a result of the members’ FSS contracts).   As such, AMSG’s arguments 
concerning Harkcon’s alleged failure to sign the BPA are not persuasive.   On this record, we reject the protester’s argument that Harkcon’s quotation was ineligible for award because MELE, the CTA leader, held the BPA instead of Harkcon.        
 
Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Finally, AMSG challenges the best -value tradeoff decision, complaining the decision 
was based on a flawed evaluation, and the SSO failed to consider the substantive differences between the vendors’ quotations.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 36- 39; 
Supp. Comments at 2 6-28.  With respect to the latter argument, t he protester 
elaborates:  “ the [SSO]  never even acknowledged, much less substantively discussed, 
AMSG ’s six more strengths than Harkcon, much less explained why those six strengths, 
individually and col lectively, do not make AMSG technically superior. ”  Comments & 
Supp. Protest at  38.  NNSA replies that the SSO “considered the unique attributes of 
each quotation and reached a well -supported best value determination.”  COS/MOL 
at 22.  
 Where, as here, a procurement conducted pursuant to FAR subpart 8.4 provides for issuance of a task order on a “ best-value”  tradeoff basis, it is the function of the source 
selection authority  to perform a price/technical tradeoff, that is, to determine whether 
one quotation’ s technical superiority is worth its higher price.  Spatial Front, Inc. , 
B-422058.2, B -422058.3, May 21, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 120 at 14.  Even where a 
solicitation issued under FAR subpart 8.4 emphasizes technical merit over price, an agenc y properly may select a lower -priced, lower -rated quotation if the agency 
reasonably concludes that the price premium involved in selecting a higher -rated,  Page 10    B-423290; B -423290.2   higher -priced quotation is not justified in light of the acceptable level of technical 
competence available at a lower price.  Id.; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, 
B-422823.2, Nov.  18, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 272 at 8.   The extent to which technical 
superiority is traded for a lower price is governed only by the test of rationality and 
consistency with the stated evaluation criteria.  Spatial Front, supra; Booz Allen 
Hamilton, supra.   
 Additionally , there is no need for extensive documentation of every consideration 
factored into a tradeoff decision.  Alethix LLC , B-420920.3, B -420920.4, Dec. 15, 2022, 
2022 CPD ¶ 316 at 10.  Rather, the documentation need only be sufficient to establish 
that the agency was aware of the relative merits and costs of the competing quotations and that the source selection was reasonably based.  Id. 
 First, we reject AMSG’s protest of the agency ’s best -value tradeoff decision based on its 
challenges to the underlying evaluation.   Comments & Supp. Protest at 37- 38.  This

 Furthermore, the record here does not support the protester’s contention that the SSO failed to consider the substantive differences between the vendors’ quotations.  The award decision included  a detailed discussion of the evaluators’ findings for each 
quotation under each factor.  For example, for the technical narrative/approach factor, the TEP noted AMSG’s “ [DELETED] .”  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award  at 10.  The TEP also 
noted AMSG’s use of a [DELETED] .  Id.  The award decision includes a similar 
discussion  of AMSG’s quotation under the other factors.
7  Id. at 11.   After discussing the 
evaluation findings for each quotation, the SSO wrote:  
 
Harkcon’s quotation offered the best value to the government, providing 
the required services at a $1,247,405.00, or 11.9 [percent], lower price 
than AMSG while ensuring the same very high probability of successful 
performance.  While Harkcon’s and AMSG’s quotations each had unique 
attributes under the non- price factors, none of the unique attributes or 
strengths of AMSG's proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an 
additional 11.9 [percent] price premium.  
 Id. at 17.    
 
In light of the contemporaneous record, we see no basis to conclude that the agency did 
not adequately consider the technical benefits of AMSG’s quotation.  The SSO made a 
business decision that the advantages in the protester’s quotation did not justify the 
associated price premium , and the SSO’s reasoning was consistent with the RFQ’s 
 
7 In addition to discussing specific aspects of the vendors’ quotations, the SSO 
concurred with and adopted the TEP’s assessments of strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies, as well as the adjectival ratings assigned to each quotation.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of  Award at 10.    Page 11    B-423290; B -423290.2   statement that the agency would not pay “a price premium it considers disproportionate 
to the benefits associated with the evaluated non- price superiority.”  RFQ at 68.  O ur 
Office has consistently concluded that a source selection official may reasonably select 
a lower priced, lower technically rated quotation, even where price is the least important  
facto r.  Spatial Front, supra; Booz Allen Hamilton, supra.  Here, the protester simply 
disagrees with the agency ’s business judgment, and such disagreement provides no 
basis to sustain the protest.8

8 To the extent the protester asserts that the SSO was required to specifically address 
each strength that the TEP identified in the vendors’ quotations, the argument lacks merit because a procuring agency is not required to document every consideration that factored into the tradeoff decision.  Alethix LLC, supra.  Here, the SSO discussed several of the strengths identified in each quotation, and the SSO stated that she independently reviewed and adopted the TEP’s findings.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award at 10.  In this regard, we have no basis to object to the agency ’s tradeoff determination.  "

DECISION  
 SysCom, Inc., of Colorado Springs, Colorado, protests the rejection of the proposal it submitted in response to request for proposals (RFP) No. FA481924R0009, issued by the Department of the Air Force for support services for multiple Air Force bases.  SysCom asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  
 We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The Air Force issued the solicitation on September 20, 2024, pursuant to Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15 as a competitive 8(a) set -aside.1  The 
solicitation provided for the award of a fixed- price  contract for support services for 
 
1 Section  8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes the Small B usiness  Administration 
(SBA)  to contract with other government agencies and to arrange for the performance of 
those contracts via subcontracts awarded to socially and economically disadvantaged 
small business concerns.  15 U.S.C.  § 637(a) .   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423334  multiple Air Force locations for a base year, four 1- year option periods, and one 6-
month extension period.  The solicitation provided for award on a best -value tradeoff 
basis, considering the following three evaluation factors:  technical, past performance, 
and price.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFP at 66.  The technical evaluation factor 
consisted of four subfactors:  staffing plan; security clearances; mission essential 
services plan; and quality control plan.  Each subfactor included multiple elements that 
offerors were required to address.  T he staffing plan subfactor was composed of four 
elements, including, as relevant here:  
 
(d) a description of how the offeror intends to maintain uninterrupted 
service during the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or 
other sustained leave to ensure no degradation to continued services.   
 
AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4.  
 
The RFP explained the evaluation and award selection process as follows.   
First, the agency would perform a compliance check to ensure that the proposal 
complied with all solicitation instructions.  Id. at 8.  Second, the agency would rank all 
compliant proposals in order of  price .  Id.  Third, starting with the lowest -
priced proposal, the agency would evaluate the technical proposals under the technical 
factor on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, until two or more quotations were found to 
be technically acceptable.   Id.  A proposal that was evaluated as unacceptable under 
any element of a subfactor was rated as unacceptable for that subfactor.  A proposal 
that was rated unacceptable under any technical subfactor was rated unacceptable 
under the technical factor.  Id.   Fourth, the agency would evaluate the technically 
acceptable proposals under the past performance factor until at least one proposal was 
rated substantial confidence for past performance or until all technically acceptable 
proposals were evaluated for past performance. 2  Id.  Finally, o nce the g overnment 
evaluated a proposal as technically acceptable with a substantial confidence rating for 
past performance or completed evaluations of all responsive proposals, the g overnment 
would conduct a best -value tradeoff analysis  based on those proposals determined to 
be technically acceptable consider ing the past performance rating and price.  Id. 
 
Eleven offerors, including SysCom, submitted proposals in response to the solicitation.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 3.  SysCom passed the initial compliance review and was ranked second lowest for price.  AR, Tab 39, Source Selection Decision (SSD) at 8; AR, Tab 38, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 20.  The 
agency evaluated SysCom’s proposal for technical acceptability and found that it was unacceptable under both the staffing plan and mission essential services plan 
subfactors.  AR, Tab 38, SSEB Report  at 22, 24.  The proposal was therefore evaluated 
as unacceptable under the technical factor and eliminated from the competition.  Id.  
at 26.   On February 18, SysCom timely filed its protest.       
 
2 The potential past performance ratings were substantial confidence, satisfactory 
confidence, neutral confidence, limited confidence, and no confidence.  AR, Tab 23, RFP, amend. 2, Evaluation Factors  at 7.    Page 3 B-423334   
DISCUSSION  SysCom protests that the agency unreasonably evaluated its technical proposal under the staffing plan and mission essential services subfactors.  SysCom also asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate its past performance and unreasonably evaluated its price.  The agency maintains that it reasonably evaluated SysCom’s proposal in accordance with the solicitation.  As discussed below, we deny the protest.  
 Staffing Plan  
 Under the staffing plan subfactor offerors were required to address four elements, including a description of how the offeror intends to maintain uninterrupted service in the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave to ensure no degradation in services.  AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4.  
SysCom’s proposal was rated unacceptable under this element because the agency concluded that SysCom’s proposal  did not describe how services would be maintained 
in the event of short term leave due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave, as required.  AR, Tab 38, SSEB Report at 22.  Specifically, the SSE B concluded: 
 
A review of the offerors proposal includes a description of their use of a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) which largely focuses on the need to maintain mission essential services.  Here, the offeror addresses circumstances such as incidents of disaster and risk mitigation; however, the offeror does not expressly discuss matters of individual personnel 
illness or injury, vacation or other forms of sustained leave.  As the 
offeror’s proposal fails to address these matters, this leaves the evaluators to assume that incidents such as those described in the COOP could 
apply to other incidents or life events to ensure maintaining uninterrupted 
services, but this is unclear.  Given this information as written, the offeror’s 
proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.  
 Id. at 22.    
 SysCom protests that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  SysCom specifically assert s that the agency failed to consider relevant information in its 
proposal.

The evaluation of proposals is generally a matter within the agency ’s discretion.  
Id.  Our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency ’s judgment  was 
reasonable and in accord with the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP.   Id.  A 
protester ’s disagreement with the agency ’s evaluation, without more, does not establish 
that the evaluation was unreasonabl e.  REEL  COH Inc., B-418095,  B-418095.2,   Page 4 B-423334  Jan. 10, 2020,  2020 CPD ¶ 55 at 8.  We have reviewed the agency’s evaluation of 
SysCom’s proposal with respect to maintaining uninterrupted service in the absence of 
personnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave and conclude that it was reasonable.  
 SysCom argues that its proposal included several examples of plans to maintain uninterrupted service during the absence of personnel for any reason, which included 
plans to fill open positions and cover unexpected openings as well as to identify candidates to fill unexpected openings.  SysCom specifically notes that its proposal 
provided that it would [DELETED] .  SysCom further asserts that in its proposal, it noted 
[DELETED] .  Finally, SysCom  states that it noted that it would [DELETED], and that it 
included a list on [DELETED].     
  These strategies, as the agency points out, concern filling open positions and vacancies, not dealing with short term absences that occur because of illness or vacation.  COS at 8.  In fact, SysCom does not dispute that its proposal did not specifically address how it planned to maintain uninterrupted services that resulted from 
absences due to illness or vacation.  Comments at 2- 3.  Rather, SysCom contends that 
it provided plans to address any “other sustained leave” and that this was sufficient to meet th e solicitation requirements.  See id.   Because the protester’s proposal  did not 
address how it would cover services in case of absence for vacations and sickness, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated SysCom’s  staffing plan, and as a result its 
proposal,  as unacceptable.  
 
In its comments submitted in response to the agency report , SysCom asserts that the 
solicitation instructed offerors to provide a plan to address how they would “ maintain 
uninterrupted service during the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or  
other sustained leave to ensure no degradation to continued services.”   Comments at 2 -
3; AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4 .  The protester argues that use 
of the word “ or” indicated that offerors were not required to provide plans for an 
exhaustive list of absence types.  That is, according to the protester, if the agency 
wanted the protester to address all types of absence, including those stemming from vacations and illness,  it should have instructed offerors to provide a plan for absences 
due to “ sickness, vacations, and other sustained leave.”   Id. at 3.  SysCom concludes 
that the solicitation therefore did not require offerors to address each category of potential absence.

 The debriefing provided to the protester explained that its proposal was evaluated as unacceptable under the staffing factor because:   
Technical subfactor element 1.d. of the staffing plan requires the offeror to provide a description of how they intend to maintain uninterrupted service during absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave ensuring no degradation in service.  The evaluators 
concluded the proposal failed to discuss matters of individual personnel illness or injury, vacation or other forms of sustained leave with adequate clarity to make an informed determination of technical acceptability.   
 Protest, exh. D, D ebriefing at 19.  
 SysCom knew from the debriefing, which was provided on February  11, 2025, and 
therefore knew when it filed its initial protest, that the agency evaluated SysCom’s proposal as unacceptable because it did not address how it intended to deal with 
absences due to illness or vacation.  SysCom’s protest  that the solicitation did not 
require it to provide a plan to deal with absences due to illness or vacation, raised for 
the first time in its comments submitted on March 31, is therefore untimely  as it 
represents a piecemeal presentation of the protest issue that could have been raised in 
the initial protest .     
 
Since the agency reasonably evaluated SysCom’s proposal under the staffing plan 
factor as unacceptable, SysCom is not eligible for award.  SysCom therefore is not an interested party to pursue its other challenge s to the evaluation of its proposal under the 
mission essential services plan subfactor, the past performance factor, or the price  
factor .  See  Tetra Tech Tesoro,  Inc., B-403797,  Dec. 14, 2010,  2011  CPD ¶ 7 at 6.

Seaport  Next Generation ( NxG) multiple -award, indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity 
(IDIQ) c ontract , pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423379   part 16.  Agency Report (AR), a ttach. 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation sought proposals to 
provide engineering and t echnical services and deliverables for cargo and weapons 
handling and stowage systems , as well as  aircraft launch and r ecovery systems.   Id. 
at 5, 8; Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 2.   The 
RFP, issued as a small business set -aside,  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-
fixed -fee task order with a 1 -year base period and four 1- year option periods .  RFP at 5. 
 
The solicitation required proposals to be submitted electronically through the SeaPort -
NxG portal.  Id.  at 95.  Proposals were due by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)  
on February 14, 2025.2  Id. at 2; COS/MOL at 3.  As relevant here, the RFP provided 
that, “in order to be considered for award,” “[p]roposals shall be submitted through the 
SeaPort -NxG portal by the solicitation closing date and time.”  RFP at 95.  The 
solicitation specified that “[i]t is not permissible to upload a link to an internet -based data 
center ( e.g. Google cloud or Dropbox),” but that offerors “shall submit all required 
proposal information as files uploaded directly in the SeaPort -NxG portal.”  Id.   The RFP 
cautioned that, “[i]n the rare event the portal is down or inaccessible, [the] Offeror shall 
immediately notify the cognizant Contracting Officer for the solicitation via email prior to the solicitation closing date and time. ”  Id.  In this regard, the solicitation also required 
that the offeror “ contact the SeaPort -NxG helpdesk to register a help ticket that the 
portal is down or inoperable prior to the closing time and date.”  Id.   In addition, the RFP 
explained that in the event “ of a portal malfunction, arrangements must be made with 
the Contracting Officer cognizant for the solicitation prior to the solicitation closing date and time in order to submit a proposal electronically outside the portal ” and that “[f] ailure  
to submit a  complete proposal prior to the solicitation closing date and time will render 
the proposal late and unacceptable. ”  Id.   
 In addition, t he solicitation also incorporated by reference FAR provision 52. 215-1, 
Instructions to Offerors –Competitive Acquisition,  which provided instructions for 
proposal submissions.  Id. at 91.   As relevant here, the provision provides that 
proposals not received by the contracting officer and contract specialist by the exact 
time specified would be “ late” and would not be evaluated unless the proposal  is 
received before award is made, the contracting officer determines that accepting the 
late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition, and one of three exceptions applies.

commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to 
the date specified for receipt of proposals , (2) there is acceptable evidence to establish 
that the proposal  was received at the g overnment installation designated for receipt of 
offers and was under the g overnment’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers,

5:07 p.m., seven minutes after the time set for receipt of proposals, LPI’s contracts

it completely threw me  out so I didn’t get a chance to enter the information . . . [or] all of 
the attachments[.]”  AR, a ttach. 5, Voicemail Screenshot at 1.  LPI’s contracts manager 
asked if the agency would “please let me email [ ] the proposal directly.”   Id.   
 Thereafter , at around 5:27 p.m., LPI email ed its proposal to the contracting officer and 
the contract specialist.  AR, attach. 8, Email Correspondence at 15- 16; COS/ MOL at  5.  
At 5:36 p.m., LPI called the contracting officer regarding its attempted proposal 
submission; the contracting officer advised that he would review the facts of LPI’s late proposal submission to determine whether the proposal could be accepted or must be rejected as untimely.  AR, attach. 7, Memorandum for Record, Mar. 3, 2025,  at 11.   
 After review, the Navy determined that LPI’s proposal was untimely and therefore must be rejected.  Id.  The Navy notified LPI on February 28, 2025, that its proposal was 
received late and thus would not be considered for award.   Id.; COS/MOL at 5.   On 
March 10, LPI filed th e instant  protest with our Office.

DISCUSSION 
 
LPI argues that the Navy unreasonably rejected its proposal as late because LPI’s late 
submission was the fault of the agency.  Protest at 5.  In the protester’s view, 
functionality issues with the agency’s SeaPort -NxG portal prevented LPI from submitting 
its proposal prior to the 5:00 p.m. deadline on the date proposals were due.  Id.  In this 
regard, the protester explains that it attempted to submit its proposal approximately 
30 minutes before the deadline, but that the SeaPort -NxG portal “froze” three times --
once roughly five minutes before the 5:00 p.m. deadline and two more times after several re- login attempts --preventing LPI from completing its proposal submission via 
the por tal prior to the deadline.  Protest at 5; Protest, exh. 1, Declaration of LPI 
 
or it is the only proposal received.  FAR provision 52.215- 1(c)(3)(ii)(A)(1 -3).  
Alternatively, the provision also provides that “ a late modification of an otherwise 
successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be 
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. ”  FAR provision 52.215-
1(c)(3)(ii)(B).  
4 Although an internal audit conducted by the agency indicates that the LPI first logged 
into the Seaport NgX portal at 4:39 p.m., the protester represents that it started uploading its submission at 4:20 p.m.  Protest at 5 .   
5 The estimated value of the task order is $46 million and is therefore within our 
jurisdiction to review protests related to the issuance of orders exceeding $3 5 million 
under multiple- award IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United 
States Code. 10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B); see also COS/MOL at 2 .    Page 4    B-423379   Contracts Specialist at 3.  According to the protester, the late submission of its proposal 
should be excused because the delay resulted from  “functionality issues” with the 
agency’s portal and that “[i]t is entirely unreasonable to expect LPI to submit a proposal when the required means by which to do so is malfunctioning completely” and that the government “must afford all eligible responsible vendors  . . . a reasonable opportunity to 
compete.”
 6  Protest at 6. 
 The agency asserts that the protester failed to submit its proposal before the submission deadline  and that the contracting officer ’s decision not to consider the 
protester ’s proposal was reasonable and in accordance with solicitation requirements 
and FAR provision 52.215- 1.  COS/MOL at 6 -11.  Based on the record before us, we 
agree with the agency and find no basis to question its decision to reject LPI’s proposal as late.  
 It is an offeror’s responsibility to deliver its proposal to the proper place at the proper time.  FAR provision 52.215- 1(c)(3); Washingtonian Coach Corp. , B-413809,

 As noted above, the solicitation explained that a proposal was considered timely and would be considered for award when “submitted through the SeaPort -NxG portal by the 
solicitation closing date and time, ” which was 5:00 p.m. EDT on February 14, 2025.  
RFP at 2, 95.  Moreover, FAR provision 52.215- 1, which was incorporated into the RFP 
be reference,  provides  in part, that proposals not received by the contracting officer by 
the exact time specified would be “late” and would not be evaluated.  Id. at 91.  In 
addition, the RFP advised that in the event of a “ portal malfunction, arrangements must

the Navy because, according to the protester, one of the exceptions permitted by FAR provision 52.215- 1 would make acceptance of its late proposal permissible.  Protest at 
5-6.  The agency substantively responded to this allegation in the agency report.  
COS/MOL at 5 -6, 9.  LPI neither refuted the agency’s response nor did it pursue this 
allegation in its comments to the agency report.  See  Comments.   Where, as here, an 
agency provides a detailed response to a protester ’s assertion and the protester fails to 
rebut the agency ’s arguments in its comments, the protester fails to provide us with a 
basis to conclude that the agency ’s position with respect to the issue in question is 
unreasonable.  4 C.F.R. §  21.3(i)(3); Medical Staffing Sols. USA, B -415571, 
B-415571.2, Dec. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 384 at  3.  We consider this  allegation to be 
abandoned and do not discuss it  further.  Medical Staffing Sols. USA, supra.   Page 5    B-423379   be made with the Contracting Officer cognizant for the solicitation prior to the solicitation 
closing date and time in order to submit a proposal electronically outside the portal” and that “[f]ailure to submit a complete proposal prior to the solicitation closing date and time 
will render the proposal late and unacceptable.”  Id. at 95.   Here, the protester concedes 
that it did not submit a complete copy of its  proposal via the Seaport -NxG portal by the 
5:00 p.m. deadline.  Protest at 5 ( The protester’s representative “was unable to 
complete the submission by the 5:00 PM deadline. ”).  In addition, LPI did not contact the 
SeaPort -NxG helpdesk to register a help ticket to report system issues or notify the 
cognizant contracting officer prior to the 5:00 p.m. February 14, 2025, closing time and date.  COS/MOL at 3, n. 2.  
 As noted above, LPI  argues that the late submission of its proposal should be excused 
because,  according to the protester, the delay was the result of problems with the 
normal operation of the SeaPort -NxG portal .  To investigate the facts related to 
protester ’s allegations and its attempts to submit its proposal, the SeaPort program 
management office, which is charged with maintaining the operation of the SeaPort 
electronic portal and administration of the SeaPort -NxG system, conducted an audit that 
revealed the portal was functioning properly on the date of submissions.  AR, a ttach. 3, 
Declaration of SeaPort System Project Manager at 2 .  Specifically, the audit revealed 
that there were “no service tickets or calls from offerors for February 13[th] [or]  14th,” 
including no service tickets or calls from LPI, “ reporting functionality issues. ”  COS/MOL 
at 6-7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  The audit  also found that another 
offeror “successfully uploaded its proposal into the Seaport portal at 3:59 p.m. EDT” on February 14--“40 minutes before LPI started its submission--with no issues reported by” that offeror.  COS/MOL at 7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  In addition, t he 
record reflects that the Navy also received proposals without issue from three other 
offerors via the SeaPort -NxG portal on February  13.  COS/MOL at 3 -4; AR, a ttach . 9, 
Time Stamped Proposals  at 25.  The record also shows that several subcontractors 
were able to upload documents into the portal from February 12 through February 14, 
without incident.  COS/MOL at 4; AR, a ttach. 9,  Time Stamped Proposals  at 25. 
 Based on the record before us, LPI  has not demonstrated that a disruption to the normal 
processes of the SeaPort -NxG portal occurred during the pertinent timeframe .  See 
Protest at 5 -7; Comments at 1 -3.  Although LPI points to an issue it experienced viewing 
a solicitation amendment in the portal on February 11, 2025 --three days prior to the 
proposal due date--which the protester reported to the portal help desk, Navy  
representatives have confirmed the operability of the SeaPort -NxG portal  during the 
period in question as normal .  As noted above, the Navy ’s audit found that  there were 
no service tickets or calls from offerors reporting functionality issues on February 13 or 14, and that another offeror successfully submitted a timely proposal via  the SeaPort -
NxG portal  at 3:59 p.m. on February 14, one hour before the proposal deadline.  
COS/MOL at 7.  Further, as pointed out by the agency, even assuming that there w ere 
periodic glitches in the SeaPort -NxG portal, the occasional malfunctioning of an on- line 
portal does  not rise to the level of systemic failure.   Id. at 9 (citing  Federal Acquisition 
Servs. Team , LLC, B -410466, Dec. 31, 2014, 2015 CPD ¶ 20 at 4) .  On these facts, 
there is no basis to conclude that the SeaPort -NxG portal  experienced a system failure 
during the period in question and LPI has not  otherwise  demonstrated government fault .  Page 6    B-423379   Finally, to the extent LPI alleges that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to 
compete, the record reflects that all offerors, including LPI, were provided ample time to submit proposals and were on notice that late proposals --i.e., proposals not submitted 
through the SeaPort -NxG portal by the solicitation closing date and time of 5:00 p.m. on 
February 14--would be rejected as unacceptable in accordance with the solicitation and FAR provision 52.215- 1.  RFP at 2, 95.  The record shows that the Navy ’s exclusion of 
LPI’s proposal as late is consistent with the terms of the solicitation  and FAR provision 
52.215- 1.  As a result, we have no basis to sustain the  protest . 
 The protest is denied.

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging agency ’s decision to reject the protester ’s proposal as late is denied 
where the proposal was not timely received by the agency in a manner consistent with the terms of the solicitation and there is no evidence of systemic failure of the web-based tool authorized for electronic submission of proposals. 
DECISION  
 La Playa, Inc . of Virginia , doing business as  LPI Technical Services  (LPI), a small 
business located in Chesapeake, Virginia, protests the exclusion of its proposal from 
consideration for award under request for proposals (RFP) No. N6449825R3042, issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center , for e ngineering and 
technical services and deliverables.   The protester contends that the agency should 
have considered its late proposal because the delay in submission was due to a system 
failure of the agency ’s web -based tool designated for electronic submission of 
proposals.  
 
We deny the protest.

DISCUSSION 
 
LPI argues that the Navy unreasonably rejected its proposal as late because LPI’s late 
submission was the fault of the agency.  Protest at 5.  In the protester’s view, 
functionality issues with the agency’s SeaPort -NxG portal prevented LPI from submitting 
its proposal prior to the 5:00 p.m. deadline on the date proposals were due.  Id.  In this 
regard, the protester explains that it attempted to submit its proposal approximately 
30 minutes before the deadline, but that the SeaPort -NxG portal “froze” three times --
once roughly five minutes before the 5:00 p.m. deadline and two more times after several re- login attempts --preventing LPI from completing its proposal submission via

should be excused because the delay resulted from  “functionality issues” with the

that it did not submit a complete copy of its  proposal via the Seaport -NxG portal by the 
5:00 p.m. deadline.  Protest at 5 ( The protester’s representative “was unable to 
complete the submission by the 5:00 PM deadline. ”).  In addition, LPI did not contact the 
SeaPort -NxG helpdesk to register a help ticket to report system issues or notify the 
cognizant contracting officer prior to the 5:00 p.m. February 14, 2025, closing time and date.  COS/MOL at 3, n. 2.  
 As noted above, LPI  argues that the late submission of its proposal should be excused 
because,  according to the protester, the delay was the result of problems with the 
normal operation of the SeaPort -NxG portal .  To investigate the facts related to 
protester ’s allegations and its attempts to submit its proposal, the SeaPort program 
management office, which is charged with maintaining the operation of the SeaPort 
electronic portal and administration of the SeaPort -NxG system, conducted an audit that 
revealed the portal was functioning properly on the date of submissions.  AR, a ttach. 3, 
Declaration of SeaPort System Project Manager at 2 .  Specifically, the audit revealed 
that there were “no service tickets or calls from offerors for February 13[th] [or]  14th,” 
including no service tickets or calls from LPI, “ reporting functionality issues. ”  COS/MOL 
at 6-7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  The audit  also found that another 
offeror “successfully uploaded its proposal into the Seaport portal at 3:59 p.m. EDT” on February 14--“40 minutes before LPI started its submission--with no issues reported by” that offeror.  COS/MOL at 7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  In addition, t he 
record reflects that the Navy also received proposals without issue from three other 
offerors via the SeaPort -NxG portal on February  13.  COS/MOL at 3 -4; AR, a ttach . 9, 
Time Stamped Proposals  at 25.  The record also shows that several subcontractors 
were able to upload documents into the portal from February 12 through February 14, 
without incident.  COS/MOL at 4; AR, a ttach. 9,  Time Stamped Proposals  at 25. 
 Based on the record before us, LPI  has not demonstrated that a disruption to the normal 
processes of the SeaPort -NxG portal occurred during the pertinent timeframe .  See 
Protest at 5 -7; Comments at 1 -3.  Although LPI points to an issue it experienced viewing 
a solicitation amendment in the portal on February 11, 2025 --three days prior to the 
proposal due date--which the protester reported to the portal help desk, Navy  
representatives have confirmed the operability of the SeaPort -NxG portal  during the 
period in question as normal .  As noted above, the Navy ’s audit found that  there were 
no service tickets or calls from offerors reporting functionality issues on February 13 or 14, and that another offeror successfully submitted a timely proposal via  the SeaPort -
NxG portal  at 3:59 p.m. on February 14, one hour before the proposal deadline.  
COS/MOL at 7.  Further, as pointed out by the agency, even assuming that there w ere 
periodic glitches in the SeaPort -NxG portal, the occasional malfunctioning of an on- line 
portal does  not rise to the level of systemic failure.   Id. at 9 (citing  Federal Acquisition 
Servs. Team , LLC, B -410466, Dec. 31, 2014, 2015 CPD ¶ 20 at 4) .  On these facts, 
there is no basis to conclude that the SeaPort -NxG portal  experienced a system failure 
during the period in question and LPI has not  otherwise  demonstrated government fault .  Page 6    B-423379   Finally, to the extent LPI alleges that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to 
compete, the record reflects that all offerors, including LPI, were provided ample time to submit proposals and were on notice that late proposals --i.e., proposals not submitted 
through the SeaPort -NxG portal by the solicitation closing date and time of 5:00 p.m. on 
February 14--would be rejected as unacceptable in accordance with the solicitation and FAR provision 52.215- 1.  RFP at 2, 95.  The record shows that the Navy ’s exclusion of 
LPI’s proposal as late is consistent with the terms of the solicitation  and FAR provision 
52.215- 1.  As a result, we have no basis to sustain the  protest . 
 The protest is denied.

restrictive of competition where protester can meet the requirements.   
 2.  Requirement in Small Business Innovation Research solicitation that proposal be signed by both a unique customer and a unique end- user is reasonable since it 
supports agency’s obligation to ensure that there is a customer who will support procurement of the item and an end- user that needs the item.  
DECISION  
 Compotech, Inc., of Brewer, Maine, pro tests the terms of small business innovation 
research (SBIR) phase II solicitation, topic AFX24.5, innovative defense- related dual 
purpose technologies/solutions with a clear Air Force stakeholder need, issued by the Air Force under broad agency announcement (BAA) Department of Defense (D OD) 
X25.5 commercial solutions opening.  Compotech asserts that the solicitation is unduly 
restrictive of competition  and that the agency is improperly treating a non- material 
requirement as mandatory.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 
The SBIR  program is conducted pursuant to the Small Business Innovation 
Development Act, 15 U.S.C. § 638, which requires certain federal agencies to reserve a 
portion of their research and development funds for awards to small businesses.  The DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423368  Small Business Administration (SBA) has the statutory obligation to issue policy 
directives for the general conduct of the government's SBIR programs.  See 15 U.S.C.  
§ 638(j) ; Agency Report  (AR), Tab 3, SBIR Program Policy Directive at 3.  The SBIR 
program has three phases:  p hase I, to determine the scientific, technical, and 
commercial merit of ideas; p hase II, to perform the principal research and development 
effort resulting in a well -defined, deliverable prototype for particular program needs; and 
phase III, during which the small business must obtain private or  non-SBIR designated 
public funding to develop the prototype into a viable commercial product for sale to 
military and/or private sector markets.  AR, Tab 3, SBIR Program Policy Directive at 18-25; See Photonics Optics Tech, Inc. , B-402967, July 28, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶  173 at 1- 2.  
 
The end items that the a gency acquires in the first two phases of the SBIR program are 
typically limited to prototypes or equipment that are incidental to demonstrating the 
feasibility of technical solutions.  Air Force o pen topics are primarily focused on non-
defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders’ needs.  See AR Tab 14, Phase II Solicitation, amend. 1 at  3, 4.  Air Force open topics do not 
state defined technological parameters, as the topics are agnostic of industry, technology, and a specific area that the agency wants to see addressed.  Id. at 4.  
However, offerors  are expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of how their 
existing mature non- defense technical solution can be adapted to meet a specific need 
of a Department of the Air Force customer.   Id.  
 On February 5, 2025, the agency issued the phase II t opic release instructions to 
businesses that had received p hase I awards.  AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation.  The 
objective of p hase II included exploring innovative technologies applicable to both 
defense and non- defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base 
for defense.  Id. at 3.  Offerors that submitted phase II proposals were expected to 
demonstrate a “high probability of identifying a product -mission fit between a[n] [Air 
Force] stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non- defense comm ercial 
solution. ”  Id.  The topic release instructions explained that this was best accomplished 
“through a proposal with a mature non- defense technical solution and a clear 
understanding of its adaptation to meet a[n] [Air Force] customer’s specific need, supported by documentation from a specific motivated, empowered [Air Force] end-user, customer, and technical point of contact . . . ready and willing to participate in the proposed prototype solution’s trial.”  Id.  
 Phase II  offerors were instructed that proposals should include development, 
installation, integration, demonstration or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.  Id. at 5.  The agency would evaluate proposals against three criteria -
-technical approach, defense need, and commercialization.  Id. at 10- 11.   
 As relevant to this protest, offerors were required to submit a customer memorandum with their phase II proposal s.  Id.  at 31- 32.  The purpose of the customer memorandum 
is to document interest from an Air Force organization in working with a phase II 
awardee on a proposed phase II effort.  AR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 1.  The solicitation required the customer memorandum  to be signed by a customer and an  Page 3 B-423368  end-user and to include all required signatures.  Phase II Solicitation at 32.  The 
solicitation also stated that the “[c]ustomer and [e]nd- [u]ser cannot be the same.”1  Id.  
The customer organization is the organization that will manage the future procurement 
or sustainment of the solution, and that will manage the funding, contracting, and 
logistics needs for p hase III awards, as appropriate.  Customer Memorandum  at 1, 7.  
The end-user organization is the operational user of the solution being prototyped and is 
the organization that directly benefits from the solution.  Id.  According to the solicitation,  
“Inclusion of a Customer Memorandum is mandatory for all proposals.  Proposals 
without a signed Customer Memorandum or proposals that do not follow the mandatory 
template will not be considered for award.”  Id.  at 15.  
 The solicitation also explained that under the defense need criterion, “[a] complete and compelling [customer memorandum] . . . signed by an appropriate end- user, customer, 
and [technical point of contact] indicates the appropriateness, relevance, and spec ificity 
of an identified [d]efense [n]eed.”  AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation at 10.  In addition, 
the solicitation stated that under the commercialization criterion, “[t]he existence of 
[p]hase II follow -on commitments for the subject research, and fundi ng commitments 
related to the subject effort, whether from government sources, as documented in the [Air Force] [c]ustomer [m]emorandum . . . are evidence of commercialization potential.”  
Id. at 10- 11. 
 
Compotech timely filed its protest challenging the terms of the phase II solicitation on 
March 6, the same day proposals were due.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Compotech protests that the requirement for two unique signatures --one from the 
customer and one from the end- user--is unduly restrictive of competition.  Compotech 
further asserts that the two -signature requirement should not be considered mandatory 
because it is immaterial  in that it does not affect price, quality, quantity, or delivery.   
 We deny the protest.  
 
Unduly Restrictive of Competition  
 Compotech protests that the requirement for two unique signatures --one from the 
customer and one from the end user --is unduly restrictive of competition.  According to 
Compotech only one signature is required to substantiate the information in the customer memorandum.   
 
 
1 The customer memorandum must also be signed by a technical point of contact who is 
expected to facilitate interactions between the company and the customer and end- user 
organizations, work to overcome tactical execution barriers, and resolve challenges.  
The technical point of contact can be the same person as the customer or the end- user.   
AR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 1.   Page 4 B-423368  Based on our review of the record, we find that Compotech is not an interested party to 
raise this issue since it is able to meet the requirement.  Compotech acknowledges in its 
protest that it could have met the requirement but had an issue with timely obtaining the required signatures.  Protest at 6.  Moreover, after the closing date for the receipt of proposals Compotech submitted a customer memorandum with unique signatures from the customer and end- user.  Protester Comments, Att. 1 at 16.  
 We have stated that a prospective offeror generally lacks standing to challenge a 
specification as unduly restrictive where it can meet the requirement set forth in the solicitation, as such a challenge would be, in essence, on behalf of other potential suppliers who are economically affected by the specification’s allegedly restrictive nature.  Government and Military Certification Systems, Inc., B- 409420, Apr. 2, 2014, 
2014 CPD ¶ 116 at 4; Accenture Federal Services, LLC, B- 418321.4, Jan. 29, 2021, 
2021 C PD ¶ 67 at 4.  Because Compotech has acknowledged that it is able to meet this 
requirement, and in fact has been able to meet it during the pendency of this protest, this basis of protest is dismissed.  
 Material Requirement  
 Com potech protests that it is unreasonable for the agency to treat the two- signature 
requirement  on the customer memorandum  as mandatory because it is not a material  
requirement .  That is, according to Compotech, the signatures do not concern the price, 
quantity, quality , or delivery terms  of the item being procured.     
 Contrary to Compotech’s  argument, agencies are not limited to establishing mandatory 
solicitation terms that concern only price, quality, quantity, or delivery.  Rather, a contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them provided the requirement is reasonably necessary to meet the agency’s needs.  Helionix Systems,  B-404905.2, May 26, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 106 at 4.    
   
Here, the phase II solicitation stated that offerors had to include two unique signatures --
one for the end- user and a different one for the customer --in the customer 
memorandum and made clear that the failure to provide the required signatures would 
render  the proposal unacceptable.  The Air Force reasonably established that the two-
signature requirement is material .  The agency explains that  the SBIR program is not a 
traditional procurement where the agency is procur ing a specific end item.  Contracting 
Officer’s Statement (COS) at 4.  Instead, the Air Force uses  the program with the goal 
of advancing scientific and technical knowledge and applying that knowledge to meet a 
recognized but unmet agency need, and to later develop a prototype into a viable 
commercial product for sale to military and or private sector markets.  Id.  at 3-4.  This 
explanation is consistent with the SBIR policy directive, which states that the purpose 
behind phase II awards is “to further develop work from p hase I that meets particular 
program needs and exhibits potential for commercial application.”  AR, Tab 3, SBIR 
Program Policy Directive  at 4.    
  Page 5 B-423368  The agency  further  explains  that the customer memorandum is the most material 
proposal submission requirement because it is a formalized way of ensuring that 
offerors submit crucial information that is necessary for the Air Force to make its selection decisions using two of its stated evaluation criteria--defense need and commercialization.  COS at 14 -15.  Specifically, as the solicitation indicated, t he 
customer memorandum documents the appropriateness, relevance, and specificity of an identified defense need.   AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation at 10.   The customer 
memorandum also documents phase II funding which is a key indicator of the potential 
for government or private sector commercialization and the benefits expected to accrue from commercialization.  Id. 
 The agency explains that the signature of the end-user evidences the validation of the 
defense need and the signature of the customer evidences the potential for commercialization.  COS at 15.  The agency maintains that the signatures also provide evidence of the formal commitment of the end-user and customer which “serve to 
safeguard both the Air Force and the [a]wardee interests in having specified individuals or groups of individuals who will use the technology proposed and their interests in having viab le acquisition and transition pathways for proposed technologies.”   Id. at 16.   
Consistent with these explanations, the customer memorandum states that the 
signatories must understand and exert influence over operational needs, formal requirements , or funding.  AR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 15.  
 While Compotech argues that the signatures themselves are not material because it is 
the narrative in the customer memorandum that documents the customer need and 
commercialization potential, the protester miss es the point.  The signatures document a 
formal commitment from the agency which does not flow from the narrative itself.  On 
this record, w e conclude that it is reasonable for the Air Force to require the signatures 
of a committed customer and a committed end- user so that it can meet its obligation t o 
award SBIR phase II  contracts that have a specific program need and 
commercialization potential.

DECISION  
 I. M. Systems Group, Inc. (IMSG), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, requests reconsideration of our decision in I. M. Sys . Grp., Inc., I. M. Sys. Grp ., B-422727.2, 
B-422727.3, Dec. 27, 2024, 2025 CPD ¶ 56,  in which we denied its protest of the 
issuance of a task order to Science and Technology Corporation (STC), a small business of Hampton, Virginia, under task order request for proposals (TORFP) No. 1332KP24R0005, issued by the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for scientific and technical services.  IMSG argues that our decision contains errors of fact and law that warrant reconsideration.  
 We deny the request for reconsideration.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the TORFP as a small business set -aside, pursuant 
to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505 procedures, to holders of NOAA’s  ProTech 2.0 Satellite Domain multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-422727.4   quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, TORFP at 2, 14.1  The 
contemplated task order , titled Atmospheric Science and Technology Applications 2.0, 
sought research and development services for NOAA’s satellite- based atmospheric and 
land surface- related mission goals, including monitoring and understanding Earth’s 
atmosphere and land surface using satellite observations.  Id. at 82.  The TORFP 
contemplated the issuance of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials task order to 
be performed for a base period of nine months with five option periods  totaling an 
additional four years .  Id. at 3 7-38, 71.  
 
The solicitation  provided that the task order would be issued on a best -value tradeoff 
basis, considering two factors:  technical approach and price.  Id . at 79 -80.  The 
technical factor included three elements, listed in descending order of importance: 
technical capability and experience, staffing, and key personnel.  Id . at 74- 75, 80.  The 
solicitation specified that the technical factor “is significantly more important than 
evaluated price” and advised that “as the non- price factor becomes more comparabl y 
equal amongst [ o]fferors[,] their total evaluated price becomes more important and 
influential in determining the best value.”  Id . at 80.  
 For the technical factor and its elements, proposals would be assigned confidence ratings
2 to determine the agency’s confidence in the offeror’s understanding of , and 
ability to effectively meet , the performance work statement (PWS) requirements.  Id.  As 
relevant here, under the staffing element, offerors were to “ [d]iscuss how the [o]fferor’s 
proposed labor mix satisfies the [PWS] requirements [,]” and the TORFP allowed 
offerors the option “to propose different labor mixes than what has historically been used[ .]”  Id.    
 Under the price factor, the solicitation indicated that the government “may use various price analysis techniques [in accordance with] FAR 15.404- 1” to conduct a price 
analysis  that “will determine if the proposed pricing is complete, fair, and reasonable, 
aligning with PWS requirements and ProTech 2.0 contract terms.”  Id. at 80.  As 
relevant here, the solicitation specified that an “[o]fferor’s proposed pricing information 
must be entirely compatible with its technical proposal [,]” id. at 75, and that “pr ices must 
align with the [o]fferor’s technical proposal.”  Id. at 80.   
 The agency received five proposals, including from IMSG (the incumbent contractor) and STC.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 6; AR, Tab 10, TET  Consensus 
Report at 8.  Following the agency’s selection of STC’s proposal  for award, IMSG filed 
its first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  In response, t he agency proposed to take corrective action by

confidence.  AR, Tab 10, Technical Evaluation Team (TET) Consensus Report at 8.    Page 3    B-422727.4   reevaluating technical proposals and conducting a new tradeoff decision, and we 
dismissed that protest as academic.  I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc ., B-422727, July 31, 2024 
(unpublished decision).  Consequently , the agency  reevaluated technical proposals as 
follows:

and 
Experience  Staffing  Key 
Personnel  Overall

IMSG  High 
Confidence  Confident  High 
Confidence  High

STC High 
Confidence  Confident  Confident  Confident  $35,574,367  
 AR, Tab  10, TET Consensus Report  at 8; COS at 8.  
 Based on this re evaluation, the agency  concluded that STC’s proposal represented the 
best value to the government , reasoning that IMSG’s technical advantages were not 
worth its associated price premium despite STC’s “slight technical inferiority.”  AR, Tab 12, Business Clearance Memorandum at 27- 28.  The agency again selected STC 
for award.    IMSG filed another protest on September 23, alleging  that the agency unreasonably 
evaluated the proposals submitted by IMSG and STC .  As relevant here, IMSG filed a 
supplemental protest on November 4, contending that the agency failed to analyze 
IMSG’s proposed labor mix under the solicitation’s staffing element  and evaluated the 
two offerors unequally .  Comments & Supp. Protest at 21- 24.  In addition, IMSG argued 
that the agency’s price evaluation--including the agency’s alleged obligation to assess whether an offeror’s price proposal was “entirely compatible” with its technical proposal -
-was unreasonable and inadequately documented.  Id . at 7 -8.      
 On December 27, our Office denied IMSG’s protest, finding that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and adequately documented.   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc.; I. M. Sys. Grp ., 
B-422727.2, B-422727.3, supra at 7-9.  After the issuance of our decision denying 
IMSG’s protest, IMSG requested that our Office reconsider our decision.

 DISCUSSION  IMSG alleges that our decision erred by failing to address  two “meritorious” protest  
grounds .  Req. for Recon. at 1.   In this regard, the requester first argues  that our Office  
 
3 As the value of the task order exceeded $10 million and wa s to be issued under an 
IDIQ contract vehicle by a civilian agency (NOAA), the underlying protest was within our 
Office ’s jurisdiction.   See 41 U.S.C. § 4106(f);  Analytic Strategies LLC; Gemini Indus. , 
Inc., B-413758.2, B- 413758.3, Nov. 28, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 340 at 4- 5.  Page 4    B-422727.4   erred, as a matter of law,  by not address ing one of IMSG’s  supplemental protest 
argument s, which  challenged  the agency ’s analy sis of  IMSG’s proposed labor mix 
under the solicitation’s staffing element.  Id.  at 1-8.  Second,  IMSG argues that our 
decision failed to acknowledge and address  the lack of documentation supporting the 
agency’s price evaluation.   Id. at 1, 8- 15.  In this regard, IMSG asserts that the 
“evaluation record contain[ ed] only a single, conclusory sentence” supporting the 
agency’s argument that  all offerors’ proposed pricing were “entirely compatible with their 
technical proposals [.]”  Id. at 1.  We have reviewed all of IMSG’s arguments and find no 
basis to reconsider our prior decision.  
 
Under our Bid Protest Regulations, to obtain reconsideration, a requesting party must demonstrate that our prior decision contains errors of fact or law, or present new information not previously considered, that would warrant reversal or modification of our earlier decision.  4 C.F.R. § 21.14(a); Department of Justice; Hope Village, Inc. --Recon. , 
B-414342.5, B -414342.6, May 21, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 195 at 4.  The repetition of 
arguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement wit h 
our prior decision do not meet this standard.  Bluehorse Corp. --Recon ., B-413929.2,  
B-413929.4, May 16, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 149 at 4.  In addition, our Office has  noted 
repeatedly that while we review , consider and resolve all issues raised by protesters, 
our decisions may not necessarily address, with specificity, every issue raised throughout the course of a protest.  See, e.g.,  Synergy Bus. Innovation & Sols., Inc. --
Recon. , B-419812.3, Dec. 15, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 389 at 4.   
 We have explained that this practice is consistent with the statutory mandate that our bid protest forum provide for “the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests.”  
See, e.g., SageCare, Inc. --Recon. , B-418292.8, June 23, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 203 at 3  
(citing  31 U.S.C. §  3554(a)(1)).  In keeping with this  statutory mandate, our Office will 
not reconsider prior decisions based on a requester’s dissatisfaction that the decision 
does not address each of its protest issues.  Id. ; accord Gunnison Consulting Grp. , Inc. -
-Recon., B-418876.5, Feb. 4, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 101 at 5  (“[O]ur  decisions may not 
necessarily address with specificity every issue raised; this practice is consistent with the statutory mandate that our bid protest forum provide for ‘the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests.’”) ( quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1)); accord Analytical 
Sols. by Kline, LLC , B-417161.3, July 11, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 398 at 4  (noting that “a 
lack of discussion is not indicative of an error of fact or law”).  
 The requester contends that by not specifically addressing its supplemental protest 
allegation (that the agency failed to properly analyze IMSG’s proposed labor mix ), our 
Office “violate[d] 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(3).”   Req. for Recon. at 4.   In furtherance of this 
argument , the requester first acknowledges our Office’s longstanding practice of not 
addressing all arguments, with specificity, in our written decisions.   Id. at 3 .  The 
requester nevertheless asserts that the statutory justification cited for this  practice--to 
provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests --does not apply here 
because “the argument which  GAO failed to analyze was a supplemental protest 
ground.”  Id.    
  Page 5    B-422727.4   In this regard, IMSG  argues  that when resolving supplemental protest grounds, if our 
Office cannot meet the statutory 100- day timeline, “Congress has instructed GAO to 
utilize the express protest option[.]”  Id.  at 4 (citing 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(3)).  The 
requester then notes  that the statutory mandate providing for the “inexpensive and 
expeditious resolution of protests” appears in 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(1) --and not in 
subsection (a)(3).  Id.  Consequently, the requester contends  that the language in (a)(1) 
“does not apply” to IMSG’s supplemental protest grounds and “therefore cannot be used 
to justify GAO’s decision to not address t his argument in its [d]ecision.”  Id .  In effect, the 
gravamen of the requester ’s argument is  that our statutory obligation to inexpensively 
and expeditiously resolve protests does not permit our Office to evade our purported 
statutory obligation to specifically  address every supplemental protest allegation raised 
by a protester --particularly because 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(3) provides our Office with 
additional time to decide supplemental protest grounds .  See id.   
 As detailed below, we find that this argument fails to allege a cognizable legal error.   
 As a threshold matter, t he requester  cites no statutory  support for the principle that our 
decisions are obligated to specifically address every argument raised by a protester.  Instead, the requester conflates our statutory requirement to resolve protests  within 100 
days with an obligation to specifically address , in our written decision,  every protest 
argument raised.   We find no support for this argument within the language of our 
statutory requirement, nor does the requester provide any support for such  an assertion.  
Here, as o ur underlying decision made clear , we considered and resolved all of IMSG’s 
protest arguments, even if we did not address each specific argument in our written 
decision.  I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc.; I. M. Sys. Grp. , B-422727.2, B -422727.3,  supra at 5 n.7 
(“In its various protest submissions, IMSG has raised arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those specifically discussed below.  While we do not address all the protester’s arguments, we have considered all of them and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.”).  Thus, we find unavailing the assertion that our Office 
“avoid[ed] resolving” IMSG’s protest grounds.   See Req. for Recon. at 4.  
 Beyond this conflation,  moreover,  the requester’s argument  that our decision violated 
applicable statutory requirements relies on an unreasonable interpretation of the cited 
statutory authority .  In matters concerning the interpretation of a statute, the first 
question is whether the statutory language provides an unambiguous expression of the intent of Congress.  See, e.g., EADS North Am., Inc. , B-291805, Mar. 26, 2003, 2003 
CPD ¶ 51 at 4 .  In this regard, we “begin with the language employed by Congress and 
the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.”   Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009).  If it 
does, the matter ends there, for the unambiguous expressed intent of Congress must be given effect.  ASRC Fed. Data Net work  Techs., LLC , B-418028, B -418028.2, 
Dec. 26, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 432 at 8.  Additionally, when  interpreting a statute, “the 
words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall  statutory scheme.”   FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 529 U.S. 120, 
133 (2000).  Consequently, statutory phrases and individual words cannot be viewed in isolation.  See Davis v. Michigan Dep’ t of the Treasury , 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989).   Page 6    B-422727.4    
As relevant here, under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), Congress conferred on our Office bid protest jurisdiction subject to specific parameters:   
 
To the maximum extent practicable, the Comptroller General shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter.  Except as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Comptroller General shall issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.  
 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1).  Congress, thr ough CICA, thus established that our office “shall” 
issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days --except as provided under 
paragraph (2).  Id.  In paragraph (2), Congress directed the Comptroller General to 
“establish an express option for deciding those protests which the Comptroller General determines suitable for resolution within 65 days after the date the protest is submitted.”
4  Id. at § 3554(a)(2).  Reading these two paragraphs together, we find that 
Congress instructed our Office to issue a final decision “concerning a protest” within 100 days --but allowed our Office the discretion to determine if certain protests are “suitable 
for resolution within 65 days [.]”  Id. at § 3554(a)(1), (2).  
 As noted above, t he requester  charges our Office with “violat [ing]” paragraph (3), which 
provides:  
 
An amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest, if timely made, should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limit 
established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for final decision of the initial 
protest.  If an amended protest cannot be resolved within such time limit, the Comptroller General may resolve the amended protest through the express option under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  
 Id. at § 3554(a)(3) .
5   
 Analyzing the words of this statute, we reject the premise of the requester’s argument that “Congress has instructed” our Office to use the express option to resolve supplemental protest allegations.   Req. for Recon. at 4.   Instead, by using the 
permissive term “may,” Congress gave our Office the discretion to resolve an amended 
protest within the 65- day timeline established in paragraph (2).   In this regard,  the first 
clause of section 3554(a)(3) indicates that the new ground of protest “should” be resolved within the mandatory 100- day timeline established in paragraph (1), to the 
 
4 Consistent with this statutory direction, our regulations establish procedures for use of 
the express option under appropriate circumstances.  See 4 C.F.R. §  21.10.   
5 “An amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest” refers to a 
“supplemental protest,” which is “a new ground of protest” that is timely filed after the “initial protest.”  See 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(3).   Page 7    B-422727.4   maximum extent practicable.  Id.   The second clause of section 3554(a)(3), however, 
allows that our Office “may resolve” the new ground of protest through the express 
option if the protest ground cannot be resolved within 100 days.6  Id.   
 We find that the use of the word “may” in section 3554(a)(3) represents an 
unambiguous expression of congressional intent to grant  our Office the discretion to 
resolve “[a]n amendment to a protest [,]” i.e., a supplemental protest ground, under the 
terms of the express option.  See id. ; cf. Huston v. United States , 956 F.2d 259, 262 
(Fed. Cir. 1992) (“When, within the same statute, Congress uses both ‘shall’ and ‘may,’ it is differentiating between mandatory and discretionary tasks.”).  We thus reject the 
requester’s contention that “Congress has instructed GAO to utilize the express protest 
option in order to resolve [IMSG’s] supplemental [protest] ground.”  See Req. for Recon. 
at 4. 
 
In contrast to the discretionary language used in section 3554(a)(3), the statute uses mandatory language that our Office “shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter,” to the maximum extent practicable.  Id.      
at § 3554(a)(1).  The language of the statute concerning “protests under this 
subchapter” does not limit this direction to “initial protests.”  Nor does the statute give 
any indication that by organizing this mandate under section 3554(a)(1), and not repeating it under section 3554(a)(3), Congress intended to direct our Office to provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of initial protests only.  Instead, we find 
that the plain words of the statute-- read in context and with a view to t heir place in the 
overall statutory scheme--reveal  the unambiguous congressional intent that we “ shall 
provide”  for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of all protests, to the maximum 
extent practicable.  This statutory direction applies to the “initial protest” and any 
“amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest,” which are both “protests 
under this subchapter.”   See 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a) (1), (3); accord 31 U.S.C. § 3551(1)(C)  
(defining a “protest” as “a written objection by an interested party to [] [a]n award or proposed award of such a contract.” ).   
 
In sum , IMSG fails to cite any basis, whether statutory or otherwise, to support the 
argument that  our Office is required to specifically address every argument advanced by 
a protester.  As a result, w e find no basis to question our Office’s longstanding practice 
of consider ing and resolv ing all protest grounds, while not necessarily addressing each 
argument or allegation , with specificity, in our written decision.  See, e.g., SageCare, 
Inc.--Recon., supra at 3.  We likewise affirm the principle that the absence of  a specific 
discussion of a protest ground or argument  is not  indicative of an error of fact or law , 
and does not, by itself, serve as a foundational basis for requests for  reconsideration.   
See, e.g., Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, supra at 4.   
 
6 Similarly, our regulations indicate that our Office  shall resolve supplemental protest 
grounds within the original 100- day time limit, to the maximum extent practicable, but if 
our Office cannot resolve the supplemental protest ground within that time limit, we 
“may resolve the supplemental or amended prot est using the express option 
procedures[.]”  See 4 C.F.R.  § 21.9.   Page 8    B-422727.4    
In addition to alleging that our Office erred by not addressing IMSG’s supplemental protest ground, the requester also a sserts that its prior challenge to the evaluation of 
IMSG’s staffing mix  was “clearly meritorious” and “objectively supported by the record[.]”  
Req. for Recon. at 4, 8.  In this regard, IMSG openly repeats its arguments from the 
underlying protest, which our Office considered and rejected.  The repetition of 
arguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet our  standard for granting reconsideration.
7   4 C.F.R.               
§ 21.14(c); Bluehorse Corp. --Recon., supra at 4.   
 
Next the requester argues that our Office committed legal and factual error , and acted 
“[i]nconsistent with [ p]recedent ,” by rejecting IMSG’s argument that the agency’s price 
evaluation was flawed and inadequately documented.  Req. for Recon. at 8- 15.  In this 
regard, IMSG asserts that our decision “fail[ed] to address the fact that the evaluation 
record contains only a single, conclusory sentence” that “all offerors’ proposed pricing were ‘entirely compatible with’ their technical proposals[.]”  Id. at 1.  Here, too, IMSG 
repeats arguments that it raised previously and urges that we reach a different 
conclusion.  IMSG’s repetition of its arguments, and disagreement with our conclusion, 
however, do not provide us a basis to reconsider our decision.   Bluehorse Corp. --
Recon., supra at 4. 
 As relevant background, i n its protest and supplemental protest, IMSG raised various 
arguments that the agency unreasonably evaluated STC’s price.  Specifically, IMSG asserted that STC’s prices were “too low to align” with the PWS requirements and the 
ProTech 2.0 master IDIQ contr act terms, as required by the TORFP.  Protest at 10.  
IMSG also alleged that STC’s low labor rates were too low to align with its technical 
approach and would prevent STC from matching incumbent salaries.  Comments & 
Supp. Protest at 3- 7.  Additionally, IM SG argued that the agency’s price evaluation 
documentation should have provided greater detail explaining how STC’s price was 
“entirely compatible with its technical proposal.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8. 
 
7 Even were we to consider these arguments, we would find no basis to grant 
reconsideration.  For example, the requester asserts that the agency did not respond directly to an argument that NOAA treated offerors disparately by crediting those offerors’ proposed labor mixes but not IMSG’s, and thus “conceded” IMSG’s claim of disparate treatment.  Req. for Recon. at 2, 7.  Contrary to the requester’s suggestion, however, the record reflects that the agency explained, in response to this protest ground, that the evaluators’ assessment of IMSG’s proposed labor mix was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria.  See  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  6-
7; Supp. COS at 6.  The agency’s response in the supplemental agency report wa s 
consistent with the initial agency report arguing that the agency reasonably and evenly evaluated IMSG and STC’s proposals under the staffing element.  See MOL at 6 -7, 16, 
23-25; COS at 6, 16, 18.  We thus  see no support for the requester’s argument that the 
agency “conceded” IMSG’s claim of disparate treatment under the staffing element or that IMSG’s protest ground was “objectively supported by the record.”  See  Req. for 
Recon. at 7- 8.    Page 9    B-422727.4    
In our decision, we analyzed all of IMSG’s protest and supplemental protest grounds and found that the documentation supporting the agency’s price evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  See   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; 
I. M. Sys. Grp., B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 5-7.   
 In its request for reconsideration, IMSG argues that our Office “erred legally by ignoring its own precedent and changing the standard for what constitutes a reasonable and adequately documented evaluation.”  Req. for Recon. at 15.  IMSG also argues that our decision rests on various “factual errors [,]” and “ignore[ d]” various facts and arguments 
that IMSG raised in its protest and supplemental protest.  See id . at 9 -15.  For example, 
IMSG asserts that our decision did not specifically address its  argument that “STC will 
not be able to match any incumbent employee’s salary, because STC’s proposed labor 
rates are all 60- 70 [percent]  lower than IMSG’s incumbent rates.”  Req. for Recon. at 12 
(citing  Supp. Protest at 10).  Finally, IMSG contends that our decision erred by 
“dismissing an argument that IMSG did not make,” citing the statement in our decision that “to the extent the protester is alleging the agency should have conducted a price realism analysis , we dismiss this aspect of the protest.”  See id.  at 8 n.4 (citing I. M. 
Sys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp.,  B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7-8 n.9) .  The 
requester argues that our decision erred by including this statement because IMSG “did not make a price realism challenge.”  Req. for Recon. at 8 n.4.  
 Notwithstanding this disclaimer,  however,  IMSG faults  the agency for not providing 
document ation  more consistent with a price realism evaluation than an evaluation 
conducted under the price evaluation criteria in this TORFP.   In this regard, IMSG 
argues that the solicitation required the agency to evaluate whether offerors’ pricing information was “entirely compatible with its technical proposal ,”
8 which  meant that 
NOAA should have conducted and documented an evaluation that  compared STC’s low 
pricing to its technical proposal.   See Req. for Recon. at 8 -15.  Specifically, IMSG 
argues that the agency should have scrutinized, and better documented, an analysis of  
STC’s proposed incumbent capture approach in light of its low pricing.  Id. at 12- 14.   
 Such an analysis, however, would have effectively amounted to a price realism 
analysis, which was not required by this  solicitation.   As our underlying decision noted, 
the more extensive  documentation urged by IMSG  was not required by the solicitation, 
“particularly given the discretion accorded to agencies conducting a price analysis .”       
I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp. , B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7.  Instead, the 
 
8 We note, too, that  the requester  conflates an instruction to offerors --that their pricing 
be “entirely compatible” with their technical proposals , see TORFP at 75--with an 
evaluation criteri on.  Our Office has repeatedly found that information provided in a 
solicitation ’s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria 
detailed in a solicitation’ s evaluation section.  See , e.g.,  All Phase Envt ’l, Inc.,

DIGEST  
 Request for reconsideration of prior decision is denied where the request does not show that our earlier decision contained an error of fact or law, or present information not previously considered that would merit modification or reversal.  
DECISION  
 I. M. Systems Group, Inc. (IMSG), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, requests reconsideration of our decision in I. M. Sys . Grp., Inc., I. M. Sys. Grp ., B-422727.2, 
B-422727.3, Dec. 27, 2024, 2025 CPD ¶ 56,  in which we denied its protest of the 
issuance of a task order to Science and Technology Corporation (STC), a small business of Hampton, Virginia, under task order request for proposals (TORFP) No. 1332KP24R0005, issued by the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for scientific and technical services.  IMSG argues that our decision contains errors of fact and law that warrant reconsideration.  
 We deny the request for reconsideration.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the TORFP as a small business set -aside, pursuant 
to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505 procedures, to holders of NOAA’s  ProTech 2.0 Satellite Domain multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-422727.4   quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, TORFP at 2, 14.1  The 
contemplated task order , titled Atmospheric Science and Technology Applications 2.0, 
sought research and development services for NOAA’s satellite- based atmospheric and 
land surface- related mission goals, including monitoring and understanding Earth’s 
atmosphere and land surface using satellite observations.  Id. at 82.  The TORFP 
contemplated the issuance of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials task order to 
be performed for a base period of nine months with five option periods  totaling an 
additional four years .  Id. at 3 7-38, 71.  
 
The solicitation  provided that the task order would be issued on a best -value tradeoff 
basis, considering two factors:  technical approach and price.  Id . at 79 -80.  The 
technical factor included three elements, listed in descending order of importance: 
technical capability and experience, staffing, and key personnel.  Id . at 74- 75, 80.  The 
solicitation specified that the technical factor “is significantly more important than 
evaluated price” and advised that “as the non- price factor becomes more comparabl y 
equal amongst [ o]fferors[,] their total evaluated price becomes more important and 
influential in determining the best value.”  Id . at 80.  
 For the technical factor and its elements, proposals would be assigned confidence ratings
2 to determine the agency’s confidence in the offeror’s understanding of , and 
ability to effectively meet , the performance work statement (PWS) requirements.  Id.  As 
relevant here, under the staffing element, offerors were to “ [d]iscuss how the [o]fferor’s 
proposed labor mix satisfies the [PWS] requirements [,]” and the TORFP allowed 
offerors the option “to propose different labor mixes than what has historically been used[ .]”  Id.    
 Under the price factor, the solicitation indicated that the government “may use various price analysis techniques [in accordance with] FAR 15.404- 1” to conduct a price 
analysis  that “will determine if the proposed pricing is complete, fair, and reasonable, 
aligning with PWS requirements and ProTech 2.0 contract terms.”  Id. at 80.  As 
relevant here, the solicitation specified that an “[o]fferor’s proposed pricing information 
must be entirely compatible with its technical proposal [,]” id. at 75, and that “pr ices must 
align with the [o]fferor’s technical proposal.”  Id. at 80.   
 The agency received five proposals, including from IMSG (the incumbent contractor) and STC.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 6; AR, Tab 10, TET  Consensus 
Report at 8.  Following the agency’s selection of STC’s proposal  for award, IMSG filed 
its first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  In response, t he agency proposed to take corrective action by

confidence.  AR, Tab 10, Technical Evaluation Team (TET) Consensus Report at 8.    Page 3    B-422727.4   reevaluating technical proposals and conducting a new tradeoff decision, and we 
dismissed that protest as academic.  I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc ., B-422727, July 31, 2024 
(unpublished decision).  Consequently , the agency  reevaluated technical proposals as 
follows:

and 
Experience  Staffing  Key 
Personnel  Overall 
Consensus  Price  
IMSG  High 
Confidence  Confident  High 
Confidence  High 
Confidence  $54,522,668  
STC High 
Confidence  Confident  Confident  Confident  $35,574,367  
 AR, Tab  10, TET Consensus Report  at 8; COS at 8.  
 Based on this re evaluation, the agency  concluded that STC’s proposal represented the 
best value to the government , reasoning that IMSG’s technical advantages were not 
worth its associated price premium despite STC’s “slight technical inferiority.”  AR, Tab 12, Business Clearance Memorandum at 27- 28.  The agency again selected STC 
for award.    IMSG filed another protest on September 23, alleging  that the agency unreasonably 
evaluated the proposals submitted by IMSG and STC .  As relevant here, IMSG filed a 
supplemental protest on November 4, contending that the agency failed to analyze 
IMSG’s proposed labor mix under the solicitation’s staffing element  and evaluated the 
two offerors unequally .  Comments & Supp. Protest at 21- 24.  In addition, IMSG argued 
that the agency’s price evaluation--including the agency’s alleged obligation to assess whether an offeror’s price proposal was “entirely compatible” with its technical proposal -
-was unreasonable and inadequately documented.  Id . at 7 -8.      
 On December 27, our Office denied IMSG’s protest, finding that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and adequately documented.   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc.; I. M. Sys. Grp ., 
B-422727.2, B-422727.3, supra at 7-9.  After the issuance of our decision denying 
IMSG’s protest, IMSG requested that our Office reconsider our decision.

 DISCUSSION  IMSG alleges that our decision erred by failing to address  two “meritorious” protest  
grounds .  Req. for Recon. at 1.   In this regard, the requester first argues  that our Office  
 
3 As the value of the task order exceeded $10 million and wa s to be issued under an 
IDIQ contract vehicle by a civilian agency (NOAA), the underlying protest was within our 
Office ’s jurisdiction.   See 41 U.S.C. § 4106(f);  Analytic Strategies LLC; Gemini Indus. , 
Inc., B-413758.2, B- 413758.3, Nov. 28, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 340 at 4- 5.  Page 4    B-422727.4   erred, as a matter of law,  by not address ing one of IMSG’s  supplemental protest 
argument s, which  challenged  the agency ’s analy sis of  IMSG’s proposed labor mix 
under the solicitation’s staffing element.  Id.  at 1-8.  Second,  IMSG argues that our 
decision failed to acknowledge and address  the lack of documentation supporting the 
agency’s price evaluation.   Id. at 1, 8- 15.  In this regard, IMSG asserts that the 
“evaluation record contain[ ed] only a single, conclusory sentence” supporting the 
agency’s argument that  all offerors’ proposed pricing were “entirely compatible with their 
technical proposals [.]”  Id. at 1.  We have reviewed all of IMSG’s arguments and find no 
basis to reconsider our prior decision.  
 
Under our Bid Protest Regulations, to obtain reconsideration, a requesting party must demonstrate that our prior decision contains errors of fact or law, or present new information not previously considered, that would warrant reversal or modification of our earlier decision.  4 C.F.R. § 21.14(a); Department of Justice; Hope Village, Inc. --Recon. , 
B-414342.5, B -414342.6, May 21, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 195 at 4.  The repetition of 
arguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement wit h 
our prior decision do not meet this standard.  Bluehorse Corp. --Recon ., B-413929.2,  
B-413929.4, May 16, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 149 at 4.  In addition, our Office has  noted 
repeatedly that while we review , consider and resolve all issues raised by protesters, 
our decisions may not necessarily address, with specificity, every issue raised throughout the course of a protest.  See, e.g.,  Synergy Bus. Innovation & Sols., Inc. --
Recon. , B-419812.3, Dec. 15, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 389 at 4.   
 We have explained that this practice is consistent with the statutory mandate that our bid protest forum provide for “the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests.”  
See, e.g., SageCare, Inc. --Recon. , B-418292.8, June 23, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 203 at 3  
(citing  31 U.S.C. §  3554(a)(1)).  In keeping with this  statutory mandate, our Office will 
not reconsider prior decisions based on a requester’s dissatisfaction that the decision 
does not address each of its protest issues.  Id. ; accord Gunnison Consulting Grp. , Inc. -
-Recon., B-418876.5, Feb. 4, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 101 at 5  (“[O]ur  decisions may not 
necessarily address with specificity every issue raised; this practice is consistent with the statutory mandate that our bid protest forum provide for ‘the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests.’”) ( quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1)); accord Analytical 
Sols. by Kline, LLC , B-417161.3, July 11, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 398 at 4  (noting that “a 
lack of discussion is not indicative of an error of fact or law”).  
 The requester contends that by not specifically addressing its supplemental protest 
allegation (that the agency failed to properly analyze IMSG’s proposed labor mix ), our 
Office “violate[d] 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(3).”   Req. for Recon. at 4.   In furtherance of this 
argument , the requester first acknowledges our Office’s longstanding practice of not 
addressing all arguments, with specificity, in our written decisions.   Id. at 3 .  The 
requester nevertheless asserts that the statutory justification cited for this  practice--to 
provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests --does not apply here 
because “the argument which  GAO failed to analyze was a supplemental protest 
ground.”  Id.    
  Page 5    B-422727.4   In this regard, IMSG  argues  that when resolving supplemental protest grounds, if our 
Office cannot meet the statutory 100- day timeline, “Congress has instructed GAO to 
utilize the express protest option[.]”  Id.  at 4 (citing 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(3)).  The 
requester then notes  that the statutory mandate providing for the “inexpensive and 
expeditious resolution of protests” appears in 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(1) --and not in 
subsection (a)(3).  Id.  Consequently, the requester contends  that the language in (a)(1) 
“does not apply” to IMSG’s supplemental protest grounds and “therefore cannot be used 
to justify GAO’s decision to not address t his argument in its [d]ecision.”  Id .  In effect, the 
gravamen of the requester ’s argument is  that our statutory obligation to inexpensively 
and expeditiously resolve protests does not permit our Office to evade our purported 
statutory obligation to specifically  address every supplemental protest allegation raised 
by a protester --particularly because 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(3) provides our Office with 
additional time to decide supplemental protest grounds .  See id.   
 As detailed below, we find that this argument fails to allege a cognizable legal error.   
 As a threshold matter, t he requester  cites no statutory  support for the principle that our 
decisions are obligated to specifically address every argument raised by a protester.  Instead, the requester conflates our statutory requirement to resolve protests  within 100 
days with an obligation to specifically address , in our written decision,  every protest 
argument raised.   We find no support for this argument within the language of our 
statutory requirement, nor does the requester provide any support for such  an assertion.  
Here, as o ur underlying decision made clear , we considered and resolved all of IMSG’s 
protest arguments, even if we did not address each specific argument in our written 
decision.  I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc.; I. M. Sys. Grp. , B-422727.2, B -422727.3,  supra at 5 n.7 
(“In its various protest submissions, IMSG has raised arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those specifically discussed below.  While we do not address all the protester’s arguments, we have considered all of them and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.”).  Thus, we find unavailing the assertion that our Office 
“avoid[ed] resolving” IMSG’s protest grounds.   See Req. for Recon. at 4.  
 Beyond this conflation,  moreover,  the requester’s argument  that our decision violated 
applicable statutory requirements relies on an unreasonable interpretation of the cited 
statutory authority .  In matters concerning the interpretation of a statute, the first 
question is whether the statutory language provides an unambiguous expression of the intent of Congress.  See, e.g., EADS North Am., Inc. , B-291805, Mar. 26, 2003, 2003 
CPD ¶ 51 at 4 .  In this regard, we “begin with the language employed by Congress and 
the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.”   Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009).  If it 
does, the matter ends there, for the unambiguous expressed intent of Congress must be given effect.  ASRC Fed. Data Net work  Techs., LLC , B-418028, B -418028.2, 
Dec. 26, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 432 at 8.  Additionally, when  interpreting a statute, “the 
words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall  statutory scheme.”   FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 529 U.S. 120, 
133 (2000).  Consequently, statutory phrases and individual words cannot be viewed in isolation.  See Davis v. Michigan Dep’ t of the Treasury , 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989).   Page 6    B-422727.4    
As relevant here, under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), Congress conferred on our Office bid protest jurisdiction subject to specific parameters:   
 
To the maximum extent practicable, the Comptroller General shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter.  Except as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Comptroller General shall issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.  
 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1).  Congress, thr ough CICA, thus established that our office “shall” 
issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days --except as provided under 
paragraph (2).  Id.  In paragraph (2), Congress directed the Comptroller General to 
“establish an express option for deciding those protests which the Comptroller General determines suitable for resolution within 65 days after the date the protest is submitted.”
4  Id. at § 3554(a)(2).  Reading these two paragraphs together, we find that 
Congress instructed our Office to issue a final decision “concerning a protest” within 100 days --but allowed our Office the discretion to determine if certain protests are “suitable 
for resolution within 65 days [.]”  Id. at § 3554(a)(1), (2).  
 As noted above, t he requester  charges our Office with “violat [ing]” paragraph (3), which 
provides:  
 
An amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest, if timely made, should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limit 
established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for final decision of the initial 
protest.  If an amended protest cannot be resolved within such time limit, the Comptroller General may resolve the amended protest through the express option under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  
 Id. at § 3554(a)(3) .
5   
 Analyzing the words of this statute, we reject the premise of the requester’s argument that “Congress has instructed” our Office to use the express option to resolve supplemental protest allegations.   Req. for Recon. at 4.   Instead, by using the 
permissive term “may,” Congress gave our Office the discretion to resolve an amended 
protest within the 65- day timeline established in paragraph (2).   In this regard,  the first 
clause of section 3554(a)(3) indicates that the new ground of protest “should” be resolved within the mandatory 100- day timeline established in paragraph (1), to the 
 
4 Consistent with this statutory direction, our regulations establish procedures for use of 
the express option under appropriate circumstances.  See 4 C.F.R. §  21.10.   
5 “An amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest” refers to a 
“supplemental protest,” which is “a new ground of protest” that is timely filed after the “initial protest.”  See 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a)(3).   Page 7    B-422727.4   maximum extent practicable.  Id.   The second clause of section 3554(a)(3), however, 
allows that our Office “may resolve” the new ground of protest through the express 
option if the protest ground cannot be resolved within 100 days.6  Id.   
 We find that the use of the word “may” in section 3554(a)(3) represents an 
unambiguous expression of congressional intent to grant  our Office the discretion to 
resolve “[a]n amendment to a protest [,]” i.e., a supplemental protest ground, under the 
terms of the express option.  See id. ; cf. Huston v. United States , 956 F.2d 259, 262 
(Fed. Cir. 1992) (“When, within the same statute, Congress uses both ‘shall’ and ‘may,’ it is differentiating between mandatory and discretionary tasks.”).  We thus reject the 
requester’s contention that “Congress has instructed GAO to utilize the express protest 
option in order to resolve [IMSG’s] supplemental [protest] ground.”  See Req. for Recon. 
at 4. 
 
In contrast to the discretionary language used in section 3554(a)(3), the statute uses mandatory language that our Office “shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter,” to the maximum extent practicable.  Id.      
at § 3554(a)(1).  The language of the statute concerning “protests under this 
subchapter” does not limit this direction to “initial protests.”  Nor does the statute give 
any indication that by organizing this mandate under section 3554(a)(1), and not repeating it under section 3554(a)(3), Congress intended to direct our Office to provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of initial protests only.  Instead, we find 
that the plain words of the statute-- read in context and with a view to t heir place in the 
overall statutory scheme--reveal  the unambiguous congressional intent that we “ shall 
provide”  for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of all protests, to the maximum 
extent practicable.  This statutory direction applies to the “initial protest” and any 
“amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest,” which are both “protests 
under this subchapter.”   See 31 U.S.C.  § 3554(a) (1), (3); accord 31 U.S.C. § 3551(1)(C)  
(defining a “protest” as “a written objection by an interested party to [] [a]n award or proposed award of such a contract.” ).   
 
In sum , IMSG fails to cite any basis, whether statutory or otherwise, to support the 
argument that  our Office is required to specifically address every argument advanced by 
a protester.  As a result, w e find no basis to question our Office’s longstanding practice 
of consider ing and resolv ing all protest grounds, while not necessarily addressing each 
argument or allegation , with specificity, in our written decision.  See, e.g., SageCare, 
Inc.--Recon., supra at 3.  We likewise affirm the principle that the absence of  a specific 
discussion of a protest ground or argument  is not  indicative of an error of fact or law , 
and does not, by itself, serve as a foundational basis for requests for  reconsideration.   
See, e.g., Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, supra at 4.   
 
6 Similarly, our regulations indicate that our Office  shall resolve supplemental protest 
grounds within the original 100- day time limit, to the maximum extent practicable, but if 
our Office cannot resolve the supplemental protest ground within that time limit, we 
“may resolve the supplemental or amended prot est using the express option 
procedures[.]”  See 4 C.F.R.  § 21.9.   Page 8    B-422727.4    
In addition to alleging that our Office erred by not addressing IMSG’s supplemental protest ground, the requester also a sserts that its prior challenge to the evaluation of 
IMSG’s staffing mix  was “clearly meritorious” and “objectively supported by the record[.]”  
Req. for Recon. at 4, 8.  In this regard, IMSG openly repeats its arguments from the 
underlying protest, which our Office considered and rejected.  The repetition of 
arguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet our  standard for granting reconsideration.
7   4 C.F.R.               
§ 21.14(c); Bluehorse Corp. --Recon., supra at 4.   
 
Next the requester argues that our Office committed legal and factual error , and acted 
“[i]nconsistent with [ p]recedent ,” by rejecting IMSG’s argument that the agency’s price 
evaluation was flawed and inadequately documented.  Req. for Recon. at 8- 15.  In this 
regard, IMSG asserts that our decision “fail[ed] to address the fact that the evaluation 
record contains only a single, conclusory sentence” that “all offerors’ proposed pricing were ‘entirely compatible with’ their technical proposals[.]”  Id. at 1.  Here, too, IMSG 
repeats arguments that it raised previously and urges that we reach a different 
conclusion.  IMSG’s repetition of its arguments, and disagreement with our conclusion, 
however, do not provide us a basis to reconsider our decision.   Bluehorse Corp. --
Recon., supra at 4. 
 As relevant background, i n its protest and supplemental protest, IMSG raised various 
arguments that the agency unreasonably evaluated STC’s price.  Specifically, IMSG asserted that STC’s prices were “too low to align” with the PWS requirements and the 
ProTech 2.0 master IDIQ contr act terms, as required by the TORFP.  Protest at 10.  
IMSG also alleged that STC’s low labor rates were too low to align with its technical 
approach and would prevent STC from matching incumbent salaries.  Comments & 
Supp. Protest at 3- 7.  Additionally, IM SG argued that the agency’s price evaluation 
documentation should have provided greater detail explaining how STC’s price was 
“entirely compatible with its technical proposal.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8. 
 
7 Even were we to consider these arguments, we would find no basis to grant 
reconsideration.  For example, the requester asserts that the agency did not respond directly to an argument that NOAA treated offerors disparately by crediting those offerors’ proposed labor mixes but not IMSG’s, and thus “conceded” IMSG’s claim of disparate treatment.  Req. for Recon. at 2, 7.  Contrary to the requester’s suggestion, however, the record reflects that the agency explained, in response to this protest ground, that the evaluators’ assessment of IMSG’s proposed labor mix was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria.  See  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  6-
7; Supp. COS at 6.  The agency’s response in the supplemental agency report wa s 
consistent with the initial agency report arguing that the agency reasonably and evenly evaluated IMSG and STC’s proposals under the staffing element.  See MOL at 6 -7, 16, 
23-25; COS at 6, 16, 18.  We thus  see no support for the requester’s argument that the 
agency “conceded” IMSG’s claim of disparate treatment under the staffing element or that IMSG’s protest ground was “objectively supported by the record.”  See  Req. for 
Recon. at 7- 8.    Page 9    B-422727.4    
In our decision, we analyzed all of IMSG’s protest and supplemental protest grounds and found that the documentation supporting the agency’s price evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  See   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; 
I. M. Sys. Grp., B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 5-7.   
 In its request for reconsideration, IMSG argues that our Office “erred legally by ignoring its own precedent and changing the standard for what constitutes a reasonable and adequately documented evaluation.”  Req. for Recon. at 15.  IMSG also argues that our decision rests on various “factual errors [,]” and “ignore[ d]” various facts and arguments 
that IMSG raised in its protest and supplemental protest.  See id . at 9 -15.  For example, 
IMSG asserts that our decision did not specifically address its  argument that “STC will 
not be able to match any incumbent employee’s salary, because STC’s proposed labor 
rates are all 60- 70 [percent]  lower than IMSG’s incumbent rates.”  Req. for Recon. at 12 
(citing  Supp. Protest at 10).  Finally, IMSG contends that our decision erred by 
“dismissing an argument that IMSG did not make,” citing the statement in our decision that “to the extent the protester is alleging the agency should have conducted a price realism analysis , we dismiss this aspect of the protest.”  See id.  at 8 n.4 (citing I. M. 
Sys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp.,  B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7-8 n.9) .  The 
requester argues that our decision erred by including this statement because IMSG “did not make a price realism challenge.”  Req. for Recon. at 8 n.4.  
 Notwithstanding this disclaimer,  however,  IMSG faults  the agency for not providing 
document ation  more consistent with a price realism evaluation than an evaluation 
conducted under the price evaluation criteria in this TORFP.   In this regard, IMSG 
argues that the solicitation required the agency to evaluate whether offerors’ pricing information was “entirely compatible with its technical proposal ,”
8 which  meant that 
NOAA should have conducted and documented an evaluation that  compared STC’s low 
pricing to its technical proposal.   See Req. for Recon. at 8 -15.  Specifically, IMSG 
argues that the agency should have scrutinized, and better documented, an analysis of

 Such an analysis, however, would have effectively amounted to a price realism 
analysis, which was not required by this  solicitation.   As our underlying decision noted, 
the more extensive  documentation urged by IMSG  was not required by the solicitation, 
“particularly given the discretion accorded to agencies conducting a price analysis .”

find no reason to question our conclusion that the agency’s evaluation was  reasonable 
and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.  
 In sum, IMSG’s request for reconsideration fails to allege a cognizable legal error,  
expresses disagreement with our decision denying its earlier protest, repeats arguments made during our consideration of the protest, and does not present information that was not previously considered.  IMSG’s request does not satisfy our standard for reconsideration and does not provide a basis for reversing our prior decision.

BACKGROUND  
 
On June 15, 2023, GSA issued the One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services 
Plus (OASIS+) WOSB solicitation, seeking proposals  to provide agencies with total 
integrated solutions for a multitude of services -based requirements on a global basis.2  
AR, Tab 4, RFP at  21.  The solicitation contemplated the award of an unlimited number 
of indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contracts .  Id. at 114, 198.  The due date for 
proposals, as amended,  was October 20, 2023.   Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) 
at 3. 
 The solicitation provided that the agency intended to award contracts to all qualifying 
offeror s that, among other things,  submitted a proposal that conform ed to the 
requirements of the solicitation and proposed  a fair and reasonable price.  RFP at  198.  
As relevant here, the solicitation further provided that offeror s must be certified by the 
Small Business Administration (SBA)  as a WOSB or an Economically Disadvantaged 
Women- Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) pursuant to 13 CFR §  127.300 and Federal 
Acquisitio n Regulation ( FAR)  section 19.15 to be eligible for award.  RFP at  23.  The 
solicitation permitted  offerors  to submit a proposal  if the offeror had a pending 
application for EDWOSB or WOSB certification in DSBS.   Id. 
 
The Elimination of SAI’s Proposal from the Competition 
 
The agency received proposals  from 589 offerors by the due date on October  20, 2023, 
including one from SAI.  COS at 8.  On September  25, 2024, t he agency informed SAI  
that its proposal “ does not appear to be eligible for award” because SAI  was not an 
SBA- certified WOSB and did not have a pending application for WOSB certification  at 
the time of  proposal  submission.  Id.  at 9; AR, Tab 5, SAI DSBS Record at  2.  The 
agency  further informed  SAI that if it believed the foregoing assessment of ineligibility to 
be inaccurate, it could “provide evidence to the contrary of [the] SBA certification at the 
time of offer.”  COS at  9.  On September 28, 2024, SAI provided a copy of an 
automated email from  SBA dated October 19, 2023,  which  confirmed that SBA had 
received SAI’s application  to participate in the SBA WOSB Federal Contract Program .  
Id.; Protest, e xh. 5, SBA Certification Receipt at  1.  The contracting officer contacted the 
SBA on November  4, 2024,  to verify the WOSB status  of SAI at the time of proposal

time of the proposal submission.  AR, Tab 7, SBA Review of WOSB Certification at  1-3;

business set-aside, WOSB set -side, 8(a) small business set -aside, service -disabled 
veteran- owned small business set-aside, and historically underutilized business zone 
small business  set-aside.  RFP at  12.  Page 3 B-423359  The agency concluded that SAI was not an eligible offeror and issued an unsuccessful 
offeror letter to SAI on January  14, 2025, stating that SAI “ did not have a certification or 
pending application for EDWOSB or WOSB certification in [DSBS] at the time of offer 
submission to the OASIS+ WOSB set -aside. ”  Protest, exh.  1, Unsuccessful  Offeror

concerning SAI’s WOSB certification and provided WOSB certification from a source 
other than SBA.   COS at  9; Protest, exh. 2, SAI Req . for Recon.  at 1-2.  The contracting 
officer upheld the agency’s decision, concluding that the third- party certification was 
dated January  13, 2025, which was more than a year after the due date for proposals.   
Protest, exh. 4, GSA Resp . at 1.  The contracting officer further noted that SAI was not 
a certified WOSB, or in pending status, at the time of the due date for proposals.  Id.   
 
SAI filed an agency -level protest on January 24, protesting the agency’s determination 
that SAI was ineligible for award.   COS at 10.  The agency denied the protest on 
February 26 .  Id.  This protest with our Office followed.  
 DISCUSSION  SAI raises three main  arguments with respect to the agency’s  elimination of its proposal 
from the competition.  First, SAI argues that  the agency unreasonably eliminated its 
proposal from the competition.  Comments at  1.  Specifically, SAI contends that it 
submitted its application for WOSB certification prior to the due date for proposals and 
therefore, had a “reasonable expectation” that its certification w as pending at the time of 
proposal submission.   Id. at 2.  Second, SAI argues that the agency should not have 
relied upon DSBS for verification of an offeror’s WOSB status.  Id. at 2-3.  Third, SAI 
argues that the agency engaged in disparate treatment by awarding contracts to firms that currently do not have pending applications for WOSB certification and are not WOSB certified .  Id. at 3-6; Supp. Protest at  3-4.  For reasons discussed below, we 
deny the protest.

 In reviewing a protest challenging an agency’s evaluation, our Office will not reevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency’s discretion.  22nd Century Techs., Inc. , 
B-420139, Dec. 9, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 8 at 4.  Rather, we will review the record to 
determine whether the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id.  A 
protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment, without more, is insufficient to establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Id. 
 SAI first argues that it had a reasonable expectation that its application for WOSB certification was pending when it submitted its proposal because it filed its application for WOSB certification one day before the due date for proposals .  Comments at  1-2.  
The agency disagrees, arguing that SAI was not a certified WOSB , and did not have a 
 
3 Although we do not address every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them and find none to be meritorious.   Page 4 B-423359  pending application for WOSB certification in DSBS, prior to the submission of its 
proposal .  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  4-5. 
 As an initial matter, we note that FAR  section 19.1505(e)  provides:  
 
The contracting officer shall verify that offers received are eligible for consideration for award by checking [System for Award Management (SAM)] to see if the EDWOSB or WOSB concern is designated as a certified concern or checking DSBS for a pending appl ication for 
certification.   
 (1) If the offeror is designated as certified in SAM or has a pending application for certification in DSBS, proceed with the offer evaluation.   
 
(2) Unless the offeror is designated as certified in SAM or has a pending application for certification in DSBS, the offer is not eligible for award and shall be removed from consideration.  
 The parties agree that DSBS did not show SAI as WOSB certified or with a pending 
application at the time of proposal submission.  COS at 9;  Comments at 1 (stating that 
“SAI’s argument is  not over the status shown in DSBS”) .  Instead, the dispute concerns 
the interpretation of the term “pending”  and whether DSBS should have shown that SAI 
had a pending application at the time of proposal submission.  Comments at  1-2.  
According to the protester, the term “pending” is ambiguous and the protester  
“reasonably r elied upon the common definition” of the term as referring to a matter that 
has not been decided .  Id. at 2.  The agency contends that there is no ambiguity in the 
term “pending”  and that an application is pending only after SBA completes an initial 
review  of it.  MOL at  7.  In this regard, SBA had not performed the initial review of SAI’s 
WOSB certification application as of the solicitation closing date and therefore had not 
moved the application to pending status in DSBS.   See Protest, exh. 6, SBA WOSB 
Application Status Letter December 2023 (indicating that SAI’s application is in the initial 
screening stage and awaiting review by SBA; that once the application is deemed complete, SAI’s DSBS profile will be updated to pending.) . 
 Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s requirements, we begin by examining the plain language of the solicitation.  Point Blank Enters., Inc. , B-411839, B -411839.2, 
Nov. 4, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 345 at 4 .  If the solicitation language is unambiguous, our 
inquiry ceases.  Id.  An ambiguity, however, exists where two or more reasonable 
interpretations of the solicitation are possible.  Colt Def., LLC , B-406696, July 24, 2012, 
2012 CPD ¶ 302 at 8.  If the ambiguity is an obvious, gross, or glaring error in t he 
solicitation then it is a patent ambiguity; a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.  That said, 
even where a solicitation contains an ambiguity, we will not sustain the protest unless 
the protester demonstrates that it was competitively prejudiced by the ambiguous 
language.  CW Constr. Servs & Materials, Inc., B -279724, July 15, 1998, 98- 2 CPD ¶ 20 
at 8-9.  In these instances, we examine the record to determine whether the offeror  Page 5 B-423359  would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage if it had the opportunity to 
respond to the intended meaning.   Id.  
 Based on the record, we have no basis to sustain this protest ground.  Even if we were to agree with the protester that the term “pending” was ambiguous, the protester has not demonstrated that it was prejudiced by this ambiguity .  That is, the protester has not 
shown that , had it known the agency’s interpretation of the term “pending,”  it would have 
taken any action that would have given it a competitive advantage, such as preparing and submitting its application for WOSB certification earlier.   The protes ter instead 
argues only that it reasonably expected that DSBS would show its application as pending.  Comments at  2.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  
 SAI next argues that the agency should not have relied upon DSBS for verification concerning SAI’s WOSB status  because “the data provided by DSBS has been shown 
to be unreliabl e.”  Comments at  6.  We have no basis to object to the agency’s use of 
DSBS because, as mentioned above,  FAR section 19.1505(e) expressly  provides that 
the contracting officer is to  check DSBS to verify whether a firm has a pending 
application for WOSB certification .  In the event that the offeror does not have a pending 
certification in DSBS, the FAR mandates that the proposal “shall be removed from 
consideration.”  FAR 19.1505(e)(2).  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  
 In its final challenge, SAI contends that the agency engaged in disparate treatment by  
eliminat ing SAI’s proposal from the competition.   Comments  at 3-6; Supp. Protest 
at 3-4.  Specifically, SAI argues that “[t]here are over 100 listed . . . WOSB awardees 
with no certified or pending WOSB status in the SBA DSBS website. ”  Supp. Protest 
at 3.  The agency responds that it did not engage in disparate treatment and that all 
contracts were awarded in accordance with the solicitation and applicable regulations.  
Supp. MOL at  4. 
 It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must 
treat all offerors equally and evaluate their proposals evenhandedly against the solicitation’s requirements and evaluation criteria.  CSRA LLC, B -417635 et al. , 
Sept.  11, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 341 at 9; 22nd Century Techs., Inc. , B-417336, 
B-417336.2, May 24, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 198 at 6.  Where a protester alleges unequal 
treatment, it must show that the differences in the evaluation did not stem from 
differences between the proposals.   Camber Corp. , B-413505, Nov. 10, 2016, 2016 
CPD ¶ 350 at  8.   
 We find no merit to SAI’s argument that the agency engaged in disparate treatment .  As 
relevant here, 13 C.F.R. 127.504(d)(1)(ii) provides:  
 
For a Multiple Award Contract that is set aside specifically for EDWOSB or 
WOSB, if a business concern is an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time of offer 
and contract -level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is an 
EDWOSB or WOSB for each order issued against the contract, unless a  Page 6 B-423359  contracting officer requests recertification as an EDWOSB or WOSB for a 
specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement.  
 In an email to the agency on September 24,  2024, SBA confirmed that a firm’s eligibility 
for participation in the WOSB set -aside is based on that firm’s status “at the time of 
offer.”  AR, Tab 8, SBA Email at  2.  Any firm that was no longer WOSB -certified after 
award would be permitted to continue as  a WOSB in the procurement unless the 
agency requested recertification.  Id. ; see also 13 C.F.R.  127.504(d)(1)(ii).   Accordingly, 
SAI’s argument that there are currently  “over 100 companies ” without any WOSB 
certification or pending status in DSBS , Supp. Protest at 3,  provides no basis to sustain 
its protest bec ause the applicable regulation requires firms to possess  WOSB 
certification  only at the time of proposal submission.  13 C.F.R. 127.504(d)(1)(ii) .  
Additionally, SAI has not demonstrated disparate treatment as the agency consistently verified an offeror’s WOSB status at the time of proposal submission.  
 The protest is denied.

shown that , had it known the agency’s interpretation of the term “pending,”  it would have 
taken any action that would have given it a competitive advantage, such as preparing and submitting its application for WOSB certification earlier.   The protes ter instead 
argues only that it reasonably expected that DSBS would show its application as pending.  Comments at  2.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  
 SAI next argues that the agency should not have relied upon DSBS for verification concerning SAI’s WOSB status  because “the data provided by DSBS has been shown 
to be unreliabl e.”  Comments at  6.  We have no basis to object to the agency’s use of 
DSBS because, as mentioned above,  FAR section 19.1505(e) expressly  provides that 
the contracting officer is to  check DSBS to verify whether a firm has a pending 
application for WOSB certification .  In the event that the offeror does not have a pending 
certification in DSBS, the FAR mandates that the proposal “shall be removed from 
consideration.”  FAR 19.1505(e)(2).  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  
 In its final challenge, SAI contends that the agency engaged in disparate treatment by  
eliminat ing SAI’s proposal from the competition.   Comments  at 3-6; Supp. Protest 
at 3-4.  Specifically, SAI argues that “[t]here are over 100 listed . . . WOSB awardees 
with no certified or pending WOSB status in the SBA DSBS website. ”  Supp. Protest 
at 3.  The agency responds that it did not engage in disparate treatment and that all 
contracts were awarded in accordance with the solicitation and applicable regulations.  
Supp. MOL at  4. 
 It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must 
treat all offerors equally and evaluate their proposals evenhandedly against the solicitation’s requirements and evaluation criteria.  CSRA LLC, B -417635 et al. ,

CPD ¶ 350 at  8.   
 We find no merit to SAI’s argument that the agency engaged in disparate treatment .  As 
relevant here, 13 C.F.R. 127.504(d)(1)(ii) provides:  
 
For a Multiple Award Contract that is set aside specifically for EDWOSB or 
WOSB, if a business concern is an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time of offer 
and contract -level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is an 
EDWOSB or WOSB for each order issued against the contract, unless a  Page 6 B-423359  contracting officer requests recertification as an EDWOSB or WOSB for a 
specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement.  
 In an email to the agency on September 24,  2024, SBA confirmed that a firm’s eligibility 
for participation in the WOSB set -aside is based on that firm’s status “at the time of 
offer.”  AR, Tab 8, SBA Email at  2.  Any firm that was no longer WOSB -certified after 
award would be permitted to continue as  a WOSB in the procurement unless the 
agency requested recertification.  Id. ; see also 13 C.F.R.  127.504(d)(1)(ii).   Accordingly, 
SAI’s argument that there are currently  “over 100 companies ” without any WOSB 
certification or pending status in DSBS , Supp. Protest at 3,  provides no basis to sustain 
its protest bec ause the applicable regulation requires firms to possess  WOSB 
certification  only at the time of proposal submission.  13 C.F.R. 127.504(d)(1)(ii) .  
Additionally, SAI has not demonstrated disparate treatment as the agency consistently verified an offeror’s WOSB status at the time of proposal submission.  
 The protest is denied.

contract pool 5B .1  Agency Report (AR), Exh.  3, TOR amend. 0009 (hereinafter TOR) 
at 1; Contracting Officer's Statement (COS) at 1.  The solicitation contemplated the 
issuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) 
for the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and 
the contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  
TOR at 3.   
 The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to 
include  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and 
responsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, 
production, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 4.  The solicitation provided for the 
evaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis), technical capability, and cost/price.  Id.  at 60.  Award  was to be made 
on a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of 
importance.  Id.  The technical capability factor included the following two elements:  
task order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.  Id. at 61 -63.  The TOR explained that these two elements “ will not be 
individually rated and are not subfactors ,” but rather,  “[t]hey are areas of emphasis for 
offerors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating. ”  
Id. at 60.

unsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response , the agency notified our Office 
of its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate proposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote R sch., Inc., B-422624, June 20, 2024 (unpublished).   As a result, 
our Office dismissed the protest as academic.   Id. 
 Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of BTAS and Credence:

1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-
award IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a 
request for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead of quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do 
the same.  
2 The TOR explained that a single rating would be provided for each offeror under the 
technical capability factor based on the overall evaluation of the two elements.  TOR at 63.  The TOR also provided that technical capability would be evaluated as 
exceptional, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 64- 55.  Page 3    B-422624.2; B -422624.6

contracting officer  noted that BTAS received a weakness for it s risk mitigation table; the 
agency did not find any weaknesses in Credence’s  technical approach.  Id.   Given the 
noted strengths and lower evaluated price of Credence’s proposal, the agency found

 DISCUSSION  The protester raises two primary arguments:  (1) the a gency ’s cost  realism  evaluation 
improperly failed to utilize the agency’s independent government cost estimate (IGCE) 
and disregarded the solicitation’s stated total evaluated price ( TEP) range in the 
evaluation of proposals, and therefore, there was no competition on a common basis ; 
and (2) the agency unreasonably failed to credit the protester’s technical proposal with 
additional strengths.   Protest at  15, 19- 22.  Based on our review of the record, we find 
that none of the protester’s arguments merit sustaining the protest .

 Cost Realism Evaluation  The protester argues that the agency ’s cost evaluation improperly failed to utilize the 
agency’s independent government cost estimate (IGCE) and disregarded the solicitation’s stated TEP range in the evaluation of proposals .  Protest at 15.  Th e 
protester contends that, as a result, the agency failed to evaluate proposals on a 
common basis.   Supp. Comments at 2.  For the reasons discussed below, we find no 
basis to sustain the protest.  
 As relevant here, under the cost/price factor, the solicitation provided that GSA would conduct “cost/price analysis to determine if the pricing is fair and reasonable ( i.e., 
whether the proposed pricing is too high to endanger affordability and mission success) and for cost realism (i.e. , whether the pricing is so low that it endangers meeting the 
solicitation/PWS [Performance Work Statement]  requirements). ”  TOR at 66.   The TOR 
explained that this analysis will include the “ methods described in FAR Subpart 15.4, 
‘Contract Pricing ,’ and will encompass the pricing requirements noted in this solicitation 
Section 9.7, ‘ Volume IV: Factor III -  Cost/Price Information .’”
5  Id.  In addition, the 
solicitation included the following estimated range for the total evaluated price:  
 
It is estimated that the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for this task order will be between $275,000,000.00 and $336,000,000.00.  The TEP amount is the sum of the base and all option periods, and also includes pricing for the optional 6- month extension under FAR clause 52.217- 8, “Option to 
Extend Services.”  
Id. at 66.  As the agency further  explained in the d ebriefing,  “[t]he TEP range was 
provided to help the offerors gauge the magnitude of the requirement based upon the 
Government’s best estimates at the time.”  Protest, exh. A , Debriefing, Answer 3.  
 
In the protester’s view, the TEP range was intended to provide offerors with  a 
benchmark for cost/price proposals.  In other words,  the protester asserts,  “a proposed 
cost/price above $336 million or below $275 million was at risk of rejection under [the 
 
5 This required, for example, that offerors provide information regarding indirect rates 
(including information about historical rates and a breakout of overhead, fringe, and general and administrative expenses), direct rates, fees, and subcontractors.  Id. at 56-59.  Page 5    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   TOR] as unreasonably high, unrealistically low, or because the offeror failed to 
comprehend the complexity and risks of the work to be performed. ”  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at 4.  The protester maintains that, because GSA failed to utilize the 
solicitation’s stated TEP range in the cost evaluation,  the award decision was fatally 
flawed because there was no competition on a common basis and the a gency failed to 
evaluate proposal s evenhandedly against the solicitation requirements.  Supp. 
Comments at 2.  
 
GSA responds that although the TOR included an estimated TEP range, the solicitation did not require that the agency use the TEP range or the IGCE  in its cost realism 
analysis.  The agency asserts that its cost realism analysis reasonably complied with the solicitation requirements and was otherwise reasonable.   COS at  4. 
 We find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  As noted above, the 
TOR informed offerors that GSA estimated the TEP to be between $275 million and $336 million.  TOR at 66.  It did not require TEPs to be within that estimated range to be 
considered realistic and reasonable.  Id.  An agency’s inclusion of an estimate in a 
solicitation does not constitute a requirement that offerors ’ TEPs  must exceed that 
estimate to be considered realistic.  See, e.g. , Rollout Sys., LLC, B -414145, Feb. 24, 
2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 104 at 7- 8 (“Although the protester argues that the Navy 
unreasonably failed to compare RMC’s proposed costs to the significantly higher government estimate for the work, we have found reasonable an agency’s cost realism evaluation of the awardee’s proposed costs, where the agency did not compare the awardee’s costs to the government’s estimate; rather, an agency is permitted to employ various types of analyses in determining an offeror’s realistic cost to perform.”) .  
Furthermore, w here es timates are provided in a solicitation, there is no requirement that 
they be absolutely correct; rather the estimates must be based on the best information available and present a reasonably accurate representation of the agency’s anticipated needs.  AeroSage, LLC , B-416381, Aug. 23, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶  288 at 11.   Accordingly, 
to the extent the agency f ound that TEP s below the TEP range were realistic, the 
agency’s evaluation did not contradict the terms of the TOR.
6 
 
In addition, while BTAS also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to discard 
the TEP range and the I GCE prepared for this competition, the record shows that the 
agency found that the IGCE was  too high.7  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 44.  In this regard, in 
conducting the cost realism analysis, the agency explained that “[a]ll offers received 
were under the IGCE between the ranges of 14 [percent]  and 32 [percent] .”  Id.  The 
agency noted that the “IGCE is generally found to be higher in value than proposed 
offers as its calculations do not assume or account for pricing discounts resulting from 
competition.”  Id.  In addition, the agency explained that the IGCE was established using 
 
6 We also note that the record reflects that the protester’s TEP of $259,381,250 was 
also below the bottom of the TEP range.  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 54.  
7 GSA’s IGCE was $327,665,479.46, within the estimated TEP range stated in the TOR. 
AR, Exh. 2, ADM  at 43.   Page 6    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   SSC’s pricing information from various prior contracts that collectively constitute the 
scope of work for this task order.  Id.  at 43.  As a result, the agency concluded that the 
more appropriate consideration should be a comparison of the rates obtained through the instant competition to one another and to those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) .  COS at 4-5, 7-8; FAR 
15.404- 1(c)(2)(i)(B) (permitting use of “current and historical cost or pricing data”); 
Apogee Eng’g, LLC , B-419108, B -419108.2, Dec. 16, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 403 at 5, 9 
(agency reasonably used “the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ most current occupational employment and labor estimates” for comparison) .  Accordingly, w e are unpersuaded 
by the protester ’s arguments that the agency improperly dismissed or disregarded the 
TEP range or IGC E in its evaluation.  
 Ultimately, the record reflects that GSA analyzed each offeror’s cost proposal, including 
direct costs, escalation rate, indirect costs, and the technical evaluation board a nalysis 
of the w ork to be p erformed.  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 44- 49; COS  at 4.  This included direct 
labor rates, uncompensated overtime, shift differential , overtime premiums, labor 
escalation rates, fee evaluation, overhead, and general and administrative costs, as well as corresponding mo st probable cost adjustments.
8  AR, Exh. 2 , ADM at 44 -49; COS  
at 4-9.  Although the protester asserts that the agency improperly failed to consider the 
TEP range or IGCE in its cost realism analysis , as referenced above, an agency ’s cost 
realism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the methodology employed must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the rates proposed are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.  ATA Aerospace, LLC , 
B-417427.2, Mar. 6, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 96 at 5.  We find nothing unreasonable 
regarding the agency’s evaluation here and the protester’s disagreement with the 
evaluation, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate that the evaluation was unreasonable.  The protest ground is denied.  
 
 
8 Ultimately, t he protester does not challenge any aspect of the agency’s cost realism 
evaluation other than discussed herein.  As noted previously, although the protester initially also challenged other aspects of the agency’s cost realism analysis, it later withdrew these arguments.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 2.  In addition, the protester also argue s for the first time in its supplemental protest  that by failing to utilize the 
solicitation’s stated TEP range in the evaluation of proposals, the agency  impermissibly 
“changed the evaluation scheme after receipt of proposals.”  Id. at 6.  To the extent this 
allegation is distinct from the arguments in the initial protest, it is untimely  and will not be 
considered because the basis for the argument --that the TEP range was not considered 
in the agency’s cost/price evaluation--was known or should have been known based on information provided in the notification of award letter provided to BTAS  on October 17, 
2024, but the protester failed to file its protest within 10 days  of that date.  Protest, 
exh. B, Notification of Award (Oct. 17, 2024); 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2)  (protests based on 
other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed not later than 10 days after the protester knew or should have known of the basis for its protest, whichever is earlier .).  Page 7    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   Technical Evaluation  
 
BTAS contends that the agency failed to explain why the evaluation findings of the 
corrective action evaluation differed from the findings in the original evaluation.  Protest 
at 19-22.  Specifically, BTAS argues  that its technical proposal warranted additional 
strengths , including a significant strength,  because the agency initially assigned it 
multiple strengths in the first iteration of the procurement.  Id.  In the protester’s view, if 
the additional strengths were assessed, its proposal would have been rated as 
exceptional , rather than good.   Id.  As discussed below, we find no merit to this 
argument.  
 Our Office has stated that the fact a reevaluation of proposals varies from the original evaluation does not constitute evidence that the reevaluation was unreasonable.  FreeAlliance.com, LLC , B-420000.3 et al. , June 28, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 165 at 5- 6.  We 
have recognized that it is not unusual for different evaluators, or groups of evaluators, to reach different conclusions and assign different scores or ratings when evaluating proposals, as both objective and subjective judgments are involved.  MILVETS Sys. 
Tech., Inc. , B-409051.7, B -409051.9, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 53 at 7.  Absent a 
factual or legal basis indicating why a reevaluation was improper, an agency is generally not required to explain differing evaluation results.  Id.  The overriding concern 
in our review of a reevaluation following corrective action is not whether the final evaluation is consistent with an earlier evaluation, but rather, whether it is reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  HeiTech- PAE, LLC, B -420049.9, B -420049.10, 
June 8, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 162 at 11- 12. 
 
The record reflects that, during the prior evaluation, the agency assessed nine strengths 
and three weaknesses to BTAS ’s proposal  for the first element  of the technical 
capability factor  and six strengths and one weakness  for the second element, resulting 
in an overall rating of good.  Protest, exh. C , Notification of Award (May 20, 2024) 
at 4-10.  In conducting the reevaluation during corrective action,  the agency assessed 
seven strengths and one weakness to BTAS ’s proposal  for the  first element and one 
strength and no weaknesses for the second element , resulting in a rating of good.  AR, 
Exh. 2, ADM at 17- 22; Protest, exh. B, Notification of Award (Oct. 17, 2024) at 4- 11.  
During the debriefing, in response to a question from BTAS regarding the difference in strengths, the agency explained that its evaluators did not find that the strengths in BTAS’s proposal merited a rating of exceptional.  Protest, exh. A , Debriefing at 1.  
 Although the protester maintains that  BTAS’s proposal unreasonably was not rated 
exce ptional  and that the agency has failed to explain the difference in ratings between 
the initial evaluation and reevaluation,  as noted above,  agencies are permitted to 
change their evaluations  after taking corrective action and they are not required to make 
the same assessment.  In this regard, as previously stated, d uring the debriefing, the 
agency explained that its evaluation did not find the type of strengths to merit an exceptional  rating.  Protest, exh. A, Debriefing at 1.  While the record shows  that the 
agency did not assess as many strengths to BTAS’s proposal during the reevaluation, it also demonstrates that the agency removed several w eaknesses assessed to BTAS’s  Page 8    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   proposal  during the reevaluation.  Compare Protest, exh. C, Notification of Award 
(May  20, 2024) at  4-10, with AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 17 -22, and Protest , exh. B, Notification 
of Award (Oct. 17, 2024) at 4- 11.  F or the aspects of its proposal for which it asserts it 
should have received strengths during the reevaluation, the protester makes only 
general assertions that its proposal deserved additional strengths.  Protest at 19-22.  
The protester does not point to any specific language in its proposal or otherwis e 
demonstrate how its proposal exceeded the TOR’s requirements such that it merited strengths for th ose aspect s of its proposal.  Other than pointing to the fact that the 
reevaluation differed from the initial evaluation, the protester has failed to demonstrate or even assert how the agency’s reevaluation of its technical proposal was improper or unreasonable.  The protester’s disagr eement, without more, is insufficient to establish 
that the agency acted unreasonably.   
 The protest is denied.

for the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and 
the contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.

 The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to 
include  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and 
responsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, 
production, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 4.  The solicitation provided for the 
evaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis), technical capability, and cost/price.  Id.  at 60.  Award  was to be made 
on a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of 
importance.  Id.  The technical capability factor included the following two elements:  
task order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.  Id. at 61 -63.  The TOR explained that these two elements “ will not be 
individually rated and are not subfactors ,” but rather,  “[t]hey are areas of emphasis for 
offerors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating. ”

our Office dismissed the protest as academic.   Id. 
 Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of BTAS and Credence:

1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-
award IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a 
request for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead of quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do 
the same.  
2 The TOR explained that a single rating would be provided for each offeror under the 
technical capability factor based on the overall evaluation of the two elements.  TOR at 63.  The TOR also provided that technical capability would be evaluated as 
exceptional, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 64- 55.  Page 3    B-422624.2; B -422624.6

contracting officer  noted that BTAS received a weakness for it s risk mitigation table; the 
agency did not find any weaknesses in Credence’s  technical approach.  Id.   Given the 
noted strengths and lower evaluated price of Credence’s proposal, the agency found 
that C redence’s proposal  represented the best value and issued the task order to that

 DISCUSSION  The protester raises two primary arguments:  (1) the a gency ’s cost  realism  evaluation 
improperly failed to utilize the agency’s independent government cost estimate (IGCE) 
and disregarded the solicitation’s stated total evaluated price ( TEP) range in the 
evaluation of proposals, and therefore, there was no competition on a common basis ; 
and (2) the agency unreasonably failed to credit the protester’s technical proposal with 
additional strengths.   Protest at  15, 19- 22.  Based on our review of the record, we find 
that none of the protester’s arguments merit sustaining the protest .

 Cost Realism Evaluation  The protester argues that the agency ’s cost evaluation improperly failed to utilize the 
agency’s independent government cost estimate (IGCE) and disregarded the solicitation’s stated TEP range in the evaluation of proposals .  Protest at 15.  Th e 
protester contends that, as a result, the agency failed to evaluate proposals on a 
common basis.   Supp. Comments at 2.  For the reasons discussed below, we find no 
basis to sustain the protest.  
 As relevant here, under the cost/price factor, the solicitation provided that GSA would conduct “cost/price analysis to determine if the pricing is fair and reasonable ( i.e., 
whether the proposed pricing is too high to endanger affordability and mission success) and for cost realism (i.e. , whether the pricing is so low that it endangers meeting the 
solicitation/PWS [Performance Work Statement]  requirements). ”  TOR at 66.   The TOR 
explained that this analysis will include the “ methods described in FAR Subpart 15.4, 
‘Contract Pricing ,’ and will encompass the pricing requirements noted in this solicitation 
Section 9.7, ‘ Volume IV: Factor III -  Cost/Price Information .’”
5  Id.  In addition, the 
solicitation included the following estimated range for the total evaluated price:  
 
It is estimated that the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for this task order will be between $275,000,000.00 and $336,000,000.00.  The TEP amount is the sum of the base and all option periods, and also includes pricing for the optional 6- month extension under FAR clause 52.217- 8, “Option to 
Extend Services.”  
Id. at 66.  As the agency further  explained in the d ebriefing,  “[t]he TEP range was 
provided to help the offerors gauge the magnitude of the requirement based upon the 
Government’s best estimates at the time.”  Protest, exh. A , Debriefing, Answer 3.  
 
In the protester’s view, the TEP range was intended to provide offerors with  a 
benchmark for cost/price proposals.  In other words,  the protester asserts,  “a proposed 
cost/price above $336 million or below $275 million was at risk of rejection under [the

(including information about historical rates and a breakout of overhead, fringe, and general and administrative expenses), direct rates, fees, and subcontractors.  Id. at 56-59.  Page 5    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   TOR] as unreasonably high, unrealistically low, or because the offeror failed to 
comprehend the complexity and risks of the work to be performed. ”  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at 4.  The protester maintains that, because GSA failed to utilize the 
solicitation’s stated TEP range in the cost evaluation,  the award decision was fatally 
flawed because there was no competition on a common basis and the a gency failed to 
evaluate proposal s evenhandedly against the solicitation requirements.  Supp. 
Comments at 2.  
 
GSA responds that although the TOR included an estimated TEP range, the solicitation did not require that the agency use the TEP range or the IGCE  in its cost realism 
analysis.  The agency asserts that its cost realism analysis reasonably complied with the solicitation requirements and was otherwise reasonable.   COS at  4. 
 We find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  As noted above, the 
TOR informed offerors that GSA estimated the TEP to be between $275 million and $336 million.  TOR at 66.  It did not require TEPs to be within that estimated range to be 
considered realistic and reasonable.  Id.  An agency’s inclusion of an estimate in a 
solicitation does not constitute a requirement that offerors ’ TEPs  must exceed that 
estimate to be considered realistic.  See, e.g. , Rollout Sys., LLC, B -414145, Feb. 24, 
2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 104 at 7- 8 (“Although the protester argues that the Navy 
unreasonably failed to compare RMC’s proposed costs to the significantly higher government estimate for the work, we have found reasonable an agency’s cost realism evaluation of the awardee’s proposed costs, where the agency did not compare the awardee’s costs to the government’s estimate; rather, an agency is permitted to employ various types of analyses in determining an offeror’s realistic cost to perform.”) .  
Furthermore, w here es timates are provided in a solicitation, there is no requirement that 
they be absolutely correct; rather the estimates must be based on the best information available and present a reasonably accurate representation of the agency’s anticipated needs.  AeroSage, LLC , B-416381, Aug. 23, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶  288 at 11.   Accordingly, 
to the extent the agency f ound that TEP s below the TEP range were realistic, the 
agency’s evaluation did not contradict the terms of the TOR.
6 
 
In addition, while BTAS also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to discard 
the TEP range and the I GCE prepared for this competition, the record shows that the 
agency found that the IGCE was  too high.7  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 44.  In this regard, in 
conducting the cost realism analysis, the agency explained that “[a]ll offers received 
were under the IGCE between the ranges of 14 [percent]  and 32 [percent] .”  Id.  The 
agency noted that the “IGCE is generally found to be higher in value than proposed 
offers as its calculations do not assume or account for pricing discounts resulting from 
competition.”  Id.  In addition, the agency explained that the IGCE was established using

also below the bottom of the TEP range.  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 54.

more appropriate consideration should be a comparison of the rates obtained through the instant competition to one another and to those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) .  COS at 4-5, 7-8; FAR

(agency reasonably used “the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ most current occupational employment and labor estimates” for comparison) .  Accordingly, w e are unpersuaded 
by the protester ’s arguments that the agency improperly dismissed or disregarded the 
TEP range or IGC E in its evaluation.  
 Ultimately, the record reflects that GSA analyzed each offeror’s cost proposal, including 
direct costs, escalation rate, indirect costs, and the technical evaluation board a nalysis 
of the w ork to be p erformed.  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 44- 49; COS  at 4.  This included direct

escalation rates, fee evaluation, overhead, and general and administrative costs, as well as corresponding mo st probable cost adjustments.
8  AR, Exh. 2 , ADM at 44 -49; COS  
at 4-9.  Although the protester asserts that the agency improperly failed to consider the 
TEP range or IGCE in its cost realism analysis , as referenced above, an agency ’s cost 
realism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the methodology employed must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the rates proposed are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.  ATA Aerospace, LLC , 
B-417427.2, Mar. 6, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 96 at 5.  We find nothing unreasonable 
regarding the agency’s evaluation here and the protester’s disagreement with the 
evaluation, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate that the evaluation was unreasonable.  The protest ground is denied.  
 
 
8 Ultimately, t he protester does not challenge any aspect of the agency’s cost realism 
evaluation other than discussed herein.  As noted previously, although the protester initially also challenged other aspects of the agency’s cost realism analysis, it later withdrew these arguments.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 2.  In addition, the protester also argue s for the first time in its supplemental protest  that by failing to utilize the 
solicitation’s stated TEP range in the evaluation of proposals, the agency  impermissibly 
“changed the evaluation scheme after receipt of proposals.”  Id. at 6.  To the extent this 
allegation is distinct from the arguments in the initial protest, it is untimely  and will not be 
considered because the basis for the argument --that the TEP range was not considered 
in the agency’s cost/price evaluation--was known or should have been known based on information provided in the notification of award letter provided to BTAS  on October 17, 
2024, but the protester failed to file its protest within 10 days  of that date.  Protest, 
exh. B, Notification of Award (Oct. 17, 2024); 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2)  (protests based on 
other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed not later than 10 days after the protester knew or should have known of the basis for its protest, whichever is earlier .).  Page 7    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   Technical Evaluation  
 
BTAS contends that the agency failed to explain why the evaluation findings of the 
corrective action evaluation differed from the findings in the original evaluation.  Protest 
at 19-22.  Specifically, BTAS argues  that its technical proposal warranted additional 
strengths , including a significant strength,  because the agency initially assigned it 
multiple strengths in the first iteration of the procurement.  Id.  In the protester’s view, if 
the additional strengths were assessed, its proposal would have been rated as 
exceptional , rather than good.   Id.  As discussed below, we find no merit to this 
argument.  
 Our Office has stated that the fact a reevaluation of proposals varies from the original evaluation does not constitute evidence that the reevaluation was unreasonable.  FreeAlliance.com, LLC , B-420000.3 et al. , June 28, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 165 at 5- 6.  We 
have recognized that it is not unusual for different evaluators, or groups of evaluators, to reach different conclusions and assign different scores or ratings when evaluating proposals, as both objective and subjective judgments are involved.  MILVETS Sys. 
Tech., Inc. , B-409051.7, B -409051.9, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 53 at 7.  Absent a 
factual or legal basis indicating why a reevaluation was improper, an agency is generally not required to explain differing evaluation results.  Id.  The overriding concern 
in our review of a reevaluation following corrective action is not whether the final evaluation is consistent with an earlier evaluation, but rather, whether it is reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  HeiTech- PAE, LLC, B -420049.9, B -420049.10, 
June 8, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 162 at 11- 12. 
 
The record reflects that, during the prior evaluation, the agency assessed nine strengths 
and three weaknesses to BTAS ’s proposal  for the first element  of the technical 
capability factor  and six strengths and one weakness  for the second element, resulting 
in an overall rating of good.  Protest, exh. C , Notification of Award (May 20, 2024) 
at 4-10.  In conducting the reevaluation during corrective action,  the agency assessed 
seven strengths and one weakness to BTAS ’s proposal  for the  first element and one 
strength and no weaknesses for the second element , resulting in a rating of good.  AR,

During the debriefing, in response to a question from BTAS regarding the difference in strengths, the agency explained that its evaluators did not find that the strengths in BTAS’s proposal merited a rating of exceptional.  Protest, exh. A , Debriefing at 1.  
 Although the protester maintains that  BTAS’s proposal unreasonably was not rated 
exce ptional  and that the agency has failed to explain the difference in ratings between 
the initial evaluation and reevaluation,  as noted above,  agencies are permitted to 
change their evaluations  after taking corrective action and they are not required to make 
the same assessment.  In this regard, as previously stated, d uring the debriefing, the 
agency explained that its evaluation did not find the type of strengths to merit an exceptional  rating.  Protest, exh. A, Debriefing at 1.  While the record shows  that the 
agency did not assess as many strengths to BTAS’s proposal during the reevaluation, it also demonstrates that the agency removed several w eaknesses assessed to BTAS’s  Page 8    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   proposal  during the reevaluation.  Compare Protest, exh. C, Notification of Award

should have received strengths during the reevaluation, the protester makes only 
general assertions that its proposal deserved additional strengths.  Protest at 19-22.  
The protester does not point to any specific language in its proposal or otherwis e 
demonstrate how its proposal exceeded the TOR’s requirements such that it merited strengths for th ose aspect s of its proposal.  Other than pointing to the fact that the 
reevaluation differed from the initial evaluation, the protester has failed to demonstrate or even assert how the agency’s reevaluation of its technical proposal was improper or unreasonable.  The protester’s disagr eement, without more, is insufficient to establish 
that the agency acted unreasonably.

B-423440,"July 10, 2025","KoHealth  Technologies, LLC","Agency’s establishment of a noncompetitive logical follow -on task order was reasonable 
pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation subsection 
8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C).  
DECISION  
 KoHealth Technologies, LLC, a small business of Richardson, Texas, protests a proposed sole- source task order extension to ICF Incorporated, LLC, of Reston, 
Virginia, by the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine,  for information technology modernization services 
related to the ClinicalTrials.gov website.  The protester alleges that the agency’s justification for the sole- source task order is inadequate in various ways.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 In 2020, the agency initially issued a competitively awarded task order for operation, maintenance, and modernization of ClinicalTrials.gov to ICF under the General Services Administration ’s Federal Supply Schedule contract No. GS00F010CA.  Contracting 
Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1.  The period of performance for that contract ran from  
September  29, 2020, to Sept ember  28, 2023.  Id.  In 2023 the agency issued a 
sole-source follow -on task order for continuation of the modernization effort  with a 12- Page 2 B-423440  month period of performance and a single 6- month option that would collectively extend 
performance to March 28, 2025.  Id.   Relevant to this protest, while this follow -on task 
order included Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.217 -8, Option to Extend 
Services, the agency did not evaluate pricing for that option.   Id. 
 
During the pendency of the follow -on task order the agency began conducting 
acquisition planning and market research to compete a follow -on procurement .  COS 
at 2.  Specifically, on August 27, 2024, the agency published sources sought notices 
and ultimately received capability statements from 49 firms, including the protester.  Id.   
The agency evaluated those capability statements and had additional communications with several firms, also including the protester.  Id.  
 Ultimately, however, because the ClinicalTrials.gov modernization effort was in its final phases with anticipated completion by the end of f iscal year 2025, the agency 
concluded that transition to a new vendor would result in significant delay and additional costs.  Agency Report ( AR), Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 2, 6 -7.  For 
example, the agency concluded, based on the responses to the sources sought not ices, 
that a new vendor would require a 6 to 8-month transition period and the current 
modernization phase would be completed within 6 months.  Id.   For this and other 
reasons , the agency concluded that  transitioning to a new vendor would result in delay 
of several time- sensitive deliverables , increased costs, and duplication of effort .  Id. 
 While the agency continued with acquisition planning for the recompet ition of  the 
ongoing operation and maintenance of  ClinicalTrials.gov, the agency concluded that it 
would need to exercise the option to extend services provided by FAR clause 52.217- 8 
for six months to complete the current modernization effort .  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited 
Source Justification at 2- 3.  However, because the agency did not previously evaluate 
the pricing for the option to extend services,  the exercise of that option is, in effect, a 
new procurement .  Accordingly, the agency executed a limited sources justification 
relying on FAR  subsection 8.405-6(a)(1) (i)(C), which provides that an agency may limit 
sources under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)  contract when:  
 
In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow -
on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The origi nal order or BPA [Blanket 
Purchase Agreement]  must not have been previously issued under sole-
source or limited- sources procedures.  
 
The protester filed an agency -level protest on March 7, 2025, arguing that the non-
competitive extension of services was inappropriate because of alleged technical deficiencies in ICF’s approach and alleged schedule failures in ICF’s incumbent performance.   The agency denied this protest on March 26, and this protest followed.  
  Page 3 B-423440  DISCUSSION 
 The protester alleges that the agency’s limited sources justification is inadequate in several respects.  The protester principally alleges that the agency’s “serial sole- source 
bridge [or interim] contracts” are improper because the agency has had ample 
opportunity to plan a competitive recompete, and because “program failure” is an insufficient justification for a sole- source award.  Protest at 1.  In this regard, t he 
protester further contends that the agency’s market research was inadequate and failed 
to consider the strengths of KoHealth’s capabilities statement .  Id. at 1-2.  Likewise , the 
protester contends that the agency’s conclusion that a new vendor could not transition in less than six months  was irrational.  Id.  at 2.

1 The protester advances other collateral arguments not addressed in this decision.  We 
have reviewed these arguments and conclude that they provide no basis to sustain the protest.  For example,  the protester argues in its comments on the agency report , for 
the first time, that the agency’s limited source justification was inappropriate because 
the FAR subsection relied on by the agency, FAR 8.405 -6(a)(1)(i)(C), requires that it 
may only be used to justify a follow on order when t he original order was not previously 
issued under sole- source or limited- sources procedures.   Protester’s Comments at 2.  
The protester argues that, while the original order in this case was competitively awarded, the agency has already issued one non- competitive extension to that order, 
so the current order is, in effect, a follow on from a non- competitively awarded order.  Id.  
For the reasons outlined below, w e do not reach the merits of this argument because it 
is untimely .  
 Relevant here, the agency cited this FAR subsection in its limited sources justification , 
which was published on March 26, 2025.  See AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification 
at 4.  Indeed, this FAR subsection was the sole provision identified as “ [a]cquisition 
authority” in the limited sources justification and was also quoted in full.  Id.   
Additionally, also on March 26, the agency specifically cited this FAR subsection in its denial of the protester’s agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 5.2, Agency -Level Protest 
Response at 3.  Accordingly, the protester was on notice that the agency was relying on 
FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to justify its limited source justification no later than 
March 26.  However, in its initial protest, the protester did not contend that this FAR subsection was inapplicable or inappropriate , and indeed did not cite or engage with the 
subsection.  While the initial protest did contend that the agency’s “serial sole- source” 
orders were impermissible, the protest only argued that point on the basis of a lack of 
advanced planning and alleged program failure.  See  Protest at 1.  While the protester  
now contends that it could not have known, prior to the agency report, that FAR 
subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) was central to the agency’s limited sources justification, 
that representation is inconsistent with the record.  
 Our decisions explain that the piecemeal presentation of evidence, information, or analysis supporting allegations previously made is prohibited.  Raytheon Blackbird 
(continued...)   Page 4 B-423440  In response, the agency argues that our O ffice has routinely concluded that a limited 
sources justification under the FSS is reasonably made in the interest of economy and 
efficiency  when it is based on documented concerns regarding disruption of service, 
duplication of effort, transition delays, or increased costs.  Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) 
at 4 ( citing  Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , B-417465, July 16, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 257 
at 10).  In this regard, the agency notes that its limited sources justification documents 
concerns related to all of those factors.  MOL at 4-5. 
 Similarly, concerning its market research, the agency notes that FAR subsection 8.405-
6(a)(1)(i)(C) does not require an agency to exhaust all competitive options or conduct a 
detailed comparative analysis.  Id.  at 5-6.  Rather , the FAR simply requires the agency  
to document a description of market research conducted among schedule holders and 
the results of that research or explain why market research could not be conducted.  
See FAR 8.405- 6(c)(2)(vi).  Here, the agency contends that it included such a statement 
in its limited source justification  and exceeded these requirements by conducting market 
research among both schedule holders and on the open market.  MOL at 5.  
 The FAR is clear that orders placed under the FSS are exempt from the competition requirements of FAR part 6.  FAR 8.405- 6.  Nevertheless, an agency must justify its 
decision to issue an order on a noncompetitive basis.  Id.  Our Office will review an 
agency’s use of a limited sources justification under FAR subpart 8.4, including a decision to issue a noncompetitive logical follow -on order pursuant to FAR  subsection

at 5.  Upon review of the record, we conclude that the agency’s decision to issue the 
award to ICF  under these circumstances was reasonable.  
 The agency’s position is simple and well -documented in the record.  The agency 
concluded that changing contractors in the middle of an extremely complex project with impending deadlines poses unnecessary risk to both project schedule and cost.  Instead, permitting the incumbent, which is already immersed in the project and which possesses the requisite institutional knowledge to continue the work it began five years ago would conserve time and other resources, thus making the award to the incumbent an economical and efficient choice.

reasonably should have known that the agency relied on FAR subsection 8.405-
6(a)(1) (i)(C) when it filed its initial protest, but only advanced arguments challenging the 
use of that subsection in its comments on the agency report , more than a month later, 
we dismiss this argument as an untimely piecemeal presentation of protest arguments.     Page 5 B-423440  at 2-7.  We have no basis to find the agency’s considered judgments in this regard 
unreasonable.   
 We have consistently stated that an agency’s limited sources justification is reasonably made in the interest of economy and efficiency where it is based upon documented concerns regarding disruption of service, duplication of efforts, transition delays, and/or  
increased costs.   Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , supra, at 12 -13.  In this case, the 
agency credibly documented concerns regarding all of these factors in its limited source justification.   For example, the agency notes there is an ongoing migration of  users from 
the previous system to the new system developed by ICF with users currently using both separate systems.  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 4- 5.  The agency 
reasonably concluded that transitioning to a new vendor during this migration would result in substantial delays, duplication of effort, inefficiency, and increased costs.  Id.  
at 6-7.  The agency also explained that the modernization effort is in its final phase,  
which the agency anticipates will be completed within the 6- month extension 
contemplated by the limited sources justification.  Id.  
 Likewise , while the protester alleges that the agency conducted inadequate market 
research, the record does not support that argument.  Rather , the record confirms that 
the agency solicit ed and review ed capabilities statements to determine if it could 
potentially make a transition to another vendor.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 3.5, Summary of 
Capabilit y Statement s Review.  Moreover , the agency documented its conclusions in its 
limited source justification as required by FAR 8.405- 6.  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Sources 
Justification at 8- 11.  For example, t he agency explained that its market research 
identified several vendors who could potentially meet the agency’s long- term needs for 
operation and maintenance as part of a future competition, but the agency also 
concluded that no vendor other than ICF would be able to meet the agency’s near -term 
requirements concerning the completion of the modernization effort  primarily because of 
the time required for a new vendor to transition in.  Id.   The protester clearly disagrees 
with the agency’s conclusion but provides no substantive evidence to suggest that the agency’s conclusions regarding the inefficiencies that would result from a near term transition are incorrect.  Moreover, w hile the protester would prefer that the agency had 
conducted a more searching comparison or analysis of its capabilities statement, 
FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) does not impose such a burden on an agency.   
 To the contrary , a follow- on award is permissible under this authority if it is in the 
interest of economy and efficiency, despite the existence of alternative acquisition strategies.  See Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , supra, at 14 n.13.  In this regard, there is 
no requirement that an agency consider competitive acquisition strategies prior to issuing a logical follow -on order.  Nor is there a requirement that an agency consider 
whether the logical follow -on order is the most economical or efficient acquisi tion 
strategy.  Id.  Thus , the question is not whether another strategy or another source 
could satisfy the agency’s needs, but whether the agency would likely conserve time and other resources by issuing the follow -on order.  Id.  In this case,  the agency’s  Page 6 B-423440  conclusions that it would save time and money by issuing this 6 -month extension are 
both reasonable and well -documented in the record.2 
 
The protest is denied.

2 In its initial protest the protester also argues that the risks of duplicative effort and 
schedule delays that the agency is currently seeking to mitigate are solely the result of 
the incumbent’s failure to deliver critical documentation, which represents a failure in acquisition planning on the agency’ s part.  Protest at 2 -3.  In response, the agency 
explain s that the prohibition on conducting a sole- source procurement due to a lack of 
advance planning is found in FAR section 6.301(c)(1), but orders under the FSS are specifically exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, and a limited source justification fo r an FSS order must only satisfy the requirements of FAR section 8.405- 6.  
MOL at 6 ( citing  FAR 8.405- 6).  Of note, FAR section 8.405- 6 does not include a 
prohibition on limited source justifications resulting from a lack of advance planning, and the agency contends that, under similar circumstances, our Office has dismissed challenges to agency  acquisition planning.  Id.  (citing Federal Working Grp. , B-416464,

 In response, the protester clarifies in its comments that the agency mischaracterizes its 
protest grounds and that it is  not challenging “procedural deficiencies in planning.”  
Protester’s Comments at 5.  Rather the protester argues  that it is  challenging the 
“consequences” of the agency’s alleged planning failures.  Id.  Specifically, the protester 
recast and reiterates its argument that the agency’s use of FAR section 8.405- 6 was 
unsupported because this task order was not a follow on to a competitively awarded task order, and therefore the agency was required to satisfy the requirements of FAR part 6, which the agency did not do.  Id.  However, as discussed above, we dismissed 
the protester’s arguments that the task order was not a follow -on task order under FAR 
subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C)) as an untimely piecemeal presentation and found the 
agency’s use of FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to be otherwise reasonable.  
Accordingly , this reiterated but substantially similar argument is also dismissed.",,"

DIGEST  
 
Agency’s establishment of a noncompetitive logical follow -on task order was reasonable 
pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation subsection 
8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C).  
DECISION  
 KoHealth Technologies, LLC, a small business of Richardson, Texas, protests a proposed sole- source task order extension to ICF Incorporated, LLC, of Reston, 
Virginia, by the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine,  for information technology modernization services 
related to the ClinicalTrials.gov website.  The protester alleges that the agency’s justification for the sole- source task order is inadequate in various ways.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 In 2020, the agency initially issued a competitively awarded task order for operation, maintenance, and modernization of ClinicalTrials.gov to ICF under the General Services Administration ’s Federal Supply Schedule contract No. GS00F010CA.  Contracting 
Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1.  The period of performance for that contract ran from  
September  29, 2020, to Sept ember  28, 2023.  Id.  In 2023 the agency issued a 
sole-source follow -on task order for continuation of the modernization effort  with a 12- Page 2 B-423440  month period of performance and a single 6- month option that would collectively extend 
performance to March 28, 2025.  Id.   Relevant to this protest, while this follow -on task 
order included Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.217 -8, Option to Extend 
Services, the agency did not evaluate pricing for that option.   Id. 
 
During the pendency of the follow -on task order the agency began conducting 
acquisition planning and market research to compete a follow -on procurement .  COS 
at 2.  Specifically, on August 27, 2024, the agency published sources sought notices 
and ultimately received capability statements from 49 firms, including the protester.  Id.   
The agency evaluated those capability statements and had additional communications with several firms, also including the protester.  Id.  
 Ultimately, however, because the ClinicalTrials.gov modernization effort was in its final phases with anticipated completion by the end of f iscal year 2025, the agency 
concluded that transition to a new vendor would result in significant delay and additional costs.  Agency Report ( AR), Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 2, 6 -7.  For 
example, the agency concluded, based on the responses to the sources sought not ices, 
that a new vendor would require a 6 to 8-month transition period and the current 
modernization phase would be completed within 6 months.  Id.   For this and other 
reasons , the agency concluded that  transitioning to a new vendor would result in delay 
of several time- sensitive deliverables , increased costs, and duplication of effort .  Id. 
 While the agency continued with acquisition planning for the recompet ition of  the 
ongoing operation and maintenance of  ClinicalTrials.gov, the agency concluded that it 
would need to exercise the option to extend services provided by FAR clause 52.217- 8 
for six months to complete the current modernization effort .  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited 
Source Justification at 2- 3.  However, because the agency did not previously evaluate 
the pricing for the option to extend services,  the exercise of that option is, in effect, a 
new procurement .  Accordingly, the agency executed a limited sources justification 
relying on FAR  subsection 8.405-6(a)(1) (i)(C), which provides that an agency may limit 
sources under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)  contract when:  
 
In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow -
on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The origi nal order or BPA [Blanket 
Purchase Agreement]  must not have been previously issued under sole-
source or limited- sources procedures.  
 
The protester filed an agency -level protest on March 7, 2025, arguing that the non-
competitive extension of services was inappropriate because of alleged technical deficiencies in ICF’s approach and alleged schedule failures in ICF’s incumbent performance.   The agency denied this protest on March 26, and this protest followed.  
  Page 3 B-423440  DISCUSSION 
 The protester alleges that the agency’s limited sources justification is inadequate in several respects.  The protester principally alleges that the agency’s “serial sole- source 
bridge [or interim] contracts” are improper because the agency has had ample 
opportunity to plan a competitive recompete, and because “program failure” is an insufficient justification for a sole- source award.  Protest at 1.  In this regard, t he 
protester further contends that the agency’s market research was inadequate and failed 
to consider the strengths of KoHealth’s capabilities statement .  Id. at 1-2.  Likewise , the 
protester contends that the agency’s conclusion that a new vendor could not transition in less than six months  was irrational.  Id.  at 2.

1 The protester advances other collateral arguments not addressed in this decision.  We 
have reviewed these arguments and conclude that they provide no basis to sustain the protest.  For example,  the protester argues in its comments on the agency report , for 
the first time, that the agency’s limited source justification was inappropriate because 
the FAR subsection relied on by the agency, FAR 8.405 -6(a)(1)(i)(C), requires that it 
may only be used to justify a follow on order when t he original order was not previously 
issued under sole- source or limited- sources procedures.   Protester’s Comments at 2.  
The protester argues that, while the original order in this case was competitively awarded, the agency has already issued one non- competitive extension to that order, 
so the current order is, in effect, a follow on from a non- competitively awarded order.  Id.  
For the reasons outlined below, w e do not reach the merits of this argument because it 
is untimely .  
 Relevant here, the agency cited this FAR subsection in its limited sources justification , 
which was published on March 26, 2025.  See AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification 
at 4.  Indeed, this FAR subsection was the sole provision identified as “ [a]cquisition 
authority” in the limited sources justification and was also quoted in full.  Id.   
Additionally, also on March 26, the agency specifically cited this FAR subsection in its denial of the protester’s agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 5.2, Agency -Level Protest 
Response at 3.  Accordingly, the protester was on notice that the agency was relying on 
FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to justify its limited source justification no later than 
March 26.  However, in its initial protest, the protester did not contend that this FAR subsection was inapplicable or inappropriate , and indeed did not cite or engage with the 
subsection.  While the initial protest did contend that the agency’s “serial sole- source” 
orders were impermissible, the protest only argued that point on the basis of a lack of 
advanced planning and alleged program failure.  See  Protest at 1.  While the protester  
now contends that it could not have known, prior to the agency report, that FAR 
subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) was central to the agency’s limited sources justification, 
that representation is inconsistent with the record.  
 Our decisions explain that the piecemeal presentation of evidence, information, or analysis supporting allegations previously made is prohibited.  Raytheon Blackbird 
(continued...)   Page 4 B-423440  In response, the agency argues that our O ffice has routinely concluded that a limited 
sources justification under the FSS is reasonably made in the interest of economy and 
efficiency  when it is based on documented concerns regarding disruption of service, 
duplication of effort, transition delays, or increased costs.  Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) 
at 4 ( citing  Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , B-417465, July 16, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 257 
at 10).  In this regard, the agency notes that its limited sources justification documents 
concerns related to all of those factors.  MOL at 4-5. 
 Similarly, concerning its market research, the agency notes that FAR subsection 8.405-
6(a)(1)(i)(C) does not require an agency to exhaust all competitive options or conduct a 
detailed comparative analysis.  Id.  at 5-6.  Rather , the FAR simply requires the agency  
to document a description of market research conducted among schedule holders and 
the results of that research or explain why market research could not be conducted.  
See FAR 8.405- 6(c)(2)(vi).  Here, the agency contends that it included such a statement 
in its limited source justification  and exceeded these requirements by conducting market 
research among both schedule holders and on the open market.  MOL at 5.  
 The FAR is clear that orders placed under the FSS are exempt from the competition requirements of FAR part 6.  FAR 8.405- 6.  Nevertheless, an agency must justify its 
decision to issue an order on a noncompetitive basis.  Id.  Our Office will review an 
agency’s use of a limited sources justification under FAR subpart 8.4, including a decision to issue a noncompetitive logical follow -on order pursuant to FAR  subsection 
8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C), for reasonableness.  Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , supra, at  12;

award to ICF  under these circumstances was reasonable.

we dismiss this argument as an untimely piecemeal presentation of protest arguments.     Page 5 B-423440  at 2-7.  We have no basis to find the agency’s considered judgments in this regard

B-423412,"July 1, 2025",Sheela Inc,"Protest challenging agency’s evaluation of protestor’s past performance is denied where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  
DECISION  
 Sheela Inc., a small business, of Wrightstown, New Jersey protests the awards of six contracts, under request for proposals (RFP) No.  FA448424R0017, issued by the 
Department of the Air Force, for design- build and construction projects at Joint Base 
McGuire  Dix Lakehurst (JBMDL), New Jersey.  The protester contends that Sheela 
should have received an award had the agency reasonably evaluated its past performance.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 
On September 5, 2024, the Air Force issued the solicitation, as a small business 
set-aside, for an indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity multiple award construction 
contract (MACC), pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 and subpart  36.3.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFP at 1; Contracting Officer Statement 
(COS) at 2.  The agency sought proposals for the execution of a broad range of design-build and construction projects at JBMDL, with award based on offerors’ responses to the solicitation’s “seed” project.  RFP at 54, 56.  The seed project was to provide partial design- build for the conversion of a dorm room into a new common area kitchenette for 
building 821.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 1; AR Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 61.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423412   
The solicitation contemplated award of five--but reserved the right to award more--MACCs for one base year and six 1- year option periods .  RFP at 207.  Award would be 
made on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering the following factors:  price and past 
performance.  Id. at 207.  Past performance was significantly more important than 
price.
1  Offers would be ranked according to the proposed seed project price.  Id. 
at 208.  The solicitation explained:   
 
If the lowest five (5) priced offerors were not determined to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance confidence assessment, the next five (5) lowest priced offerors would be evaluated, and the process would continue (in order by price) until a target of five (5) offerors were determined to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance assessment, or until all offerors re -evaluated.  
 Id.   
 The agency received 25 proposals by the solicitation’s October 21, deadline.  COS at 3.  Sheela was ranked the sixth lowest -priced offer, with a total evaluated price of 
$109,792.62.  AR, Tab 20, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 30.  After evaluating the protester’s past performance references, the agency assigned Sheela a confidence rating of “limited confidence.”  AR, Tab 21, Source Selection Decision at 3.   
 On March 12, 2025, the Air Force awarded MACCs to six offerors.
2  COS at 8.  On the 
same day, the Air Force notified Sheela that it was an unsuccessful offeror.  AR, Tab 22, Unsuccessful Offeror Letter at 2.  Sheela requested and received a written 
debriefing on March 13.  AR, Tab 23, Debrief at 1.  This protest follow ed on March 24.  
 DISCUSSION  Sheela raises multiple challenges to the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s proposal.  The protestor contends the Air Force’s evaluation of its past performance was unreasonable because the agency relied solely upon one negative Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) report and failed to consider the protestor’s 
rebuttal of the negative CPARS report.  Protest at 2- 3.  Additionally, the protester 
 
1 Past performance would be evaluated and assigned one of the following confidence 
assessment ratings:  substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral 
confidence, limited confidence, or no confidence.  RFP at 209- 210. 
2 The awardees are:  FBSG -GForce, Norristown, Pennsylvania; Ranco Construction Inc, 
Southampton, New Jersey; Benaka Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey; Eastern Construction, Wrightstown, New Jersey; Kaser Mechanical, LLC, Burlington, New Jersey; and Ritz Const ruction, Inc., Frederick, Maryland.  AR, Tab 22, Unsuccessful 
Offeror Letter at 2.   Page 3 B-423412  asserts that the Air Force’s decision to amend the solicitation after submission of 
proposals was improper.  Comments at 4- 5.  We have considered all the protester’s 
arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  
 Past Performance Evaluation  
 Sheela challenges the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s past performance.  Protest at 2.  According to Sheela, the agency improperly relied on a single negative CPARS report instead of more relevant CPARS reports with positive trends.  Id.   The agency responds 
that, consistent with the solicitation, the past performance evaluation was reasonable given Sheela’s marginal and unsatisfactory evaluations on recent and relevant CPARS reports.  MOL at 5.

 The solicitation instructed offerors to provide “a list of no more than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last five (5) years.”  RFP at 204.  The Air Force would evaluate the quality  of an offeror’s 
performance based on the recency and relevance of past performance information.  Id.  
at 209.  Further, the RFP advised that the agency’s evaluation would be based not only on the performance references submitted by the offeror, but “any ot her sources of 
information available to the Government to assess present/past performance.”  Id.  
at 204.   
 Here, in evaluating the protester’s past performance, the agency accessed 28 recent CPARS reports for Sheela and reviewed the following categories for each report:  quality, schedule, cost control, management, small business subcontracting, and regulatory compliance.  COS at 5 -6.  The agency noted, across the categories for these 
reports, Sheela received three “marginal” ratings and one “unsatisfactory” rating.  Id. ; 
AR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at 1.  Three of the negative ratings were as sessed to Sheela’s performance on contract No. 47PC0220D0009.  AR, Tab 16, 
CPARS Reports at 1.  The contract was for cyclical upgrades to judge’s chambers,  Page 4 B-423412  which included tasks such as providing new carpeting, painting, wallcovering, wood 
refinishing, and floor mastic abatement remediation.  Id .  The protester received a rating 
of marginal under the schedule category, and the CPARS report indicated Sheela had “on many occasions” failed to provide a workable schedule, did not complete the project on time, and quality deficiencies led the government to issuing three extensions.  Id. 
at 3.   
 Sheela also received a rating of marginal in the regulatory compliance category 
because of the firm’s “multiple failures to comply with [ Homeland Security Presidential 
Directive 12 ] requirements, and also failure to comply with [New York City] regulations 
for asbestos abatement work.”  Id. at 8-9.  Finally, Sheela received a rating of 
unsatisfactory under the management category because, among other things, there were “numerous communications issues, lack of supervision on site and many coordination issues were present during the performance of this contract due to poor management.”  Id. at 5-8.  Ultimately, these negative assessments led the contracting 
officer for the report to not recommend Sheela for similar work in the future.  Id. at 9. 
 The last negative rating was found in the CPARS report for contract No. FA448420D0002.  Id.  at 13.  This contract was valued at $90,000,000 and was for work 
Sheela performed as an incumbent on the prior MACC.  Id.   Sheela received a rating of 
marginal under the management category for lack of supervision on the jobsite and other delays attributable to the contractor.  Id. at 16.  Based on this recent and relevant 
performance history, the evaluators concluded that Sheela’s past performance record supported “ a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage 
several task orders at the same time and successfully perform similar magnitudes 
described in the solicitation.”  MOL at 7.  
 Sheela does not dispute that the agency could consider CPARS ratings for past performance, nor does the protester dispute that the CPARS include the discussed negative assessments.  See  Comments at 1 -2.  Instead, the protestor argues that the 
agency unreasonably gave too much weight to a single negative CPARS report and effectively ignored multiple CPARS reports with positive outcomes.  Protest at 2 (“The agency’s reliance on one single CPARS report was unreasonable in light of Sheela’s multiple more recent , favorable CPARS . . .”).  Contrary to the protester’s contentions, 
the evaluation record demonstrates otherwise.   
 As the record makes clear, Sheela’s negative performance ratings were found in two separate CPARS reports, not one as the protester suggests.  More importantly, the record reflects that the agency reviewed not only the 28 CPARS reports pulled for Sheela, but the evaluators also reviewed the three past performance questionnaires (PPQ) submitted with Sheela’s proposal.  AR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at  1-4.  Ultimately, the evaluators concluded:  
 
The past performance provided for [Sheela] referenced essentially the same scope, magnitude and complexity to the effort described in the solicitation, resulting in three “Very Relevant” ratings.  However, when  Page 5 B-423412  considering the ratings of the past performance submitted via PPQs as 
merely Satisfactory performance with no elaboration in value- add to the 
Government, and the several CPARS with very concerning performance ratings of Marginal and Unsatisfactory, the quality of [Sheela performance] is low.  As a result, a Limited Confidence rating is being assigned to 
[Sheela] as the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage several task orders at the same time and successfully  perform similar magnitudes described in the solicitation.  
 Id. at 3. 
 In other words, the agency considered both the protester’s positive and negative CPARS reports in assigning Sheela a rating of “limited confidence.”  Sheela disagrees with the agency’s past performance evaluation based on the protestor’s own judgment about  the weight that should be assigned to these performance reviews.  See  
Comments at 2.  While the protestor takes issue with the agency’s conclusion, this disagreement with the agency’s evaluation judgments, without more, does not demonstrate that those judgements were unreasonable or otherwise provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.  APC Constr., LLC, supra.  As such, we find no basis to 
object to the agency’s evaluation, and this allegation is denied.   
CPARS Rebuttal  
 Further, the protester argues that, under FAR section 42.1503(d), the agency was required--and failed--to consider Sheela’s rebuttal to its negative CPARS report when 
evaluating the firm’s past performance.  Protest at 2.  The agency responds that FAR 
section 42.1503(d) does not apply to the evaluations of offerors’ proposals and that, 
nonetheless, the Air Force did consider the CPARS rebuttal in the evaluation of Sheela’s past performance.  MOL at 7- 8. 
 Relevant here, section 42.1503(d) of the FAR provides:  
 
Contractors shall be afforded up to 14 calendar days from the date of notification of availability of the past performance evaluation to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information.  Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation.  The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. . . . These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions[.]  
 FAR 42.1503(d).  As the agency explains, the FAR provision does not govern the evaluation of an offeror’s past performance but, instead, pertains to the government’s “evaluation of a contractor’s performance of a [completed] contract and documenting that evaluation of the contractor’s performance for use in future source selections.”  MOL at 7.  We agree.   Page 6 B-423412   
Subpart 42.12 of the FAR “provides policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining contractor performance information.”  FAR 42.1500.  While the subpart acknowledges that “[p]ast performance information (including the ratings and supporting narratives) is relevant information for future source selection purposes,” nothing in the provision imposes any requirement with regards to what the agency must do with the information provided in a CPARS report.  FAR 42.1501(a); see generally  
FAR 42.15.   
 Nonetheless, even if the FAR provision afforded the protester some substantive right with regards to the agency’s evaluation of Sheela’s past performance--which it does not--the record reflects that the evaluators were aware of Sheela’s rebuttal to the 
negative CPARS report during the agency’s evaluation.   MOL at 7 (“[T]he Air Force was 
aware of Sheela’s response to its poor past performance ratings.”); AR, Tab 20, SSEB Report at 28.  Where, as here, an agency has considered reasonably available and relevant past performance information, its judgments regarding the relative merits of competing offerors’ past performance are primarily matters within the contracting agency’s discretion.  TPMC -Energy Solutions Envtl. Servs. 2009, LLC , B-408343.2 et 
al., Aug. 23, 2013, 2013 ¶ 215 at  8.  Given this record, we have no basis to conclude 
that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable or otherwise improper.  
 Remaining Challenges  
 Finally, the protester raises two new arguments for the first time in its comments to the 
agency report.   First, the protester alleges that the Air Force engaged in “a pattern of 
unfair treatment” against Sheela.  Comments at 4.  The protester’s only support for this assertion is that the Air Force did not select it for award in three prior unrelated procurements and that it has “witnesses who will testify” to the allegedly unfair treatment Sheela has suffered at the hands of unidentified individuals at the Air Force.  Id.    
 Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2;  K&K Industries, Inc. , B-420422, B -420422.2, Mar.  7, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 62 at  4.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity 
to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.  Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 
2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 260 at 4.  Our  regulations make clear  that protests other  than those 
challenging the terms of the solicitation must be filed within 10 days of when a protester 
knew, or should have known, of its basis for protest.  4  C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(2).  Where a 
protester initially files a timely protest, and later supplements it with independent grounds of protest, the later -raised allegations must independently satisfy the timeliness 
requirements, since our r egulations do not contemplate the unwarranted piecemeal 
presentation or development of protest issues.  Savvee Consulting, Inc. , B-408416.3, 
Mar. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 92 at 5.   
 Here, the protester knew the operative facts underlying this allegation prior to its initial protest , i.e., its non- selection on three prior procurements .  Thus, the information upon  Page 7 B-423412  which the protester based its new allegation in its comments w as known or should have 
been known prior to the filing of Sheela’s initial protest.  As we explained, our 
regulations do not contemplate the piecemeal presentation or development of protest 
issues through later submissions citing examples or providing alternate or more specific 
legal arguments missing from earlier general allegations of impropriety .  Id.  Because 
the protester waited until its comments to raise this new argument --which could have 
been raised in its initial protest --it is untimely and will not be considered.3  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(2); Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec. 18, 2019, 2020 CPD ¶ 8 
at 11 n.13.  
 
Second, the protester alleges, also for the first time in its comments, that the agency’s 
“decision to amend the evaluation process after the submission of proposals without 
affording offerors the opportunity to review their submissions” deprived the firm of “the 
chance to adjust its submiss ion to meet any new or clarified administrative 
requirements.”  Comments at 4- 5.  We find this allegation also to be untimely.   
 Here, the solicitation was amended three times prior to the November 12 deadline for submission of proposals.  COS at  3; AR, Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 1.  On December 31, 
the agency issued amendment 4, notifying all offerors that submitted proposals by the November  12 due date.  AR, Tab 18, Amendment 4 at 1; COS at 3.  Amendment 4 did 
not extend the due date for the submission of proposals or otherwise allow for submission of proposal revisions.   
 
Our regulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation 
which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals 
shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.   4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(1).  Where alleged improprieties do not exist in the initial solicitation, but 
subsequently occur ( e.g., via an amendment to the solicitation), they generally must be 
protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals. Id .; ODL Servs. , 
B-421537 et al. , May 25, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 130 at 6.  I f no further submissions are 
anticipated, any alleged solicitation improprieties must be protested within 10 days of 
when the alleged impropriety was known or should have been known.   4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(1).  Because the time set for receipt of proposals had passed, Sheela was 
required to file any protest challenging the amended terms of the solicitation not later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of  the basis of 
the protest --which would have been January 10, 2025.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1); ODL  
  
 
3 Because we find the argument to be untimely, we need not address whether Sheela’s 
bare assertion states a factually and legally sufficient basis of protest, as required by our regulations .  See  4 C.F.R. §  21.1(c)(4) and (f) .    Page 8 B-423412  Servs. , B-421537 et al., supra.  Consequently, this allegation is similarly dismissed as 
untimely.    
 
The protest is denied.

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging agency’s evaluation of protestor’s past performance is denied where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  
DECISION  
 Sheela Inc., a small business, of Wrightstown, New Jersey protests the awards of six contracts, under request for proposals (RFP) No.  FA448424R0017, issued by the 
Department of the Air Force, for design- build and construction projects at Joint Base 
McGuire  Dix Lakehurst (JBMDL), New Jersey.  The protester contends that Sheela 
should have received an award had the agency reasonably evaluated its past performance.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 
On September 5, 2024, the Air Force issued the solicitation, as a small business 
set-aside, for an indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity multiple award construction 
contract (MACC), pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 and subpart  36.3.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFP at 1; Contracting Officer Statement 
(COS) at 2.  The agency sought proposals for the execution of a broad range of design-build and construction projects at JBMDL, with award based on offerors’ responses to the solicitation’s “seed” project.  RFP at 54, 56.  The seed project was to provide partial design- build for the conversion of a dorm room into a new common area kitchenette for 
building 821.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 1; AR Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 61.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423412   
The solicitation contemplated award of five--but reserved the right to award more--MACCs for one base year and six 1- year option periods .  RFP at 207.  Award would be 
made on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering the following factors:  price and past 
performance.  Id. at 207.  Past performance was significantly more important than 
price.
1  Offers would be ranked according to the proposed seed project price.  Id. 
at 208.  The solicitation explained:   
 
If the lowest five (5) priced offerors were not determined to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance confidence assessment, the next five (5) lowest priced offerors would be evaluated, and the process would continue (in order by price) until a target of five (5) offerors were determined to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance assessment, or until all offerors re -evaluated.  
 Id.   
 The agency received 25 proposals by the solicitation’s October 21, deadline.  COS at 3.  Sheela was ranked the sixth lowest -priced offer, with a total evaluated price of 
$109,792.62.  AR, Tab 20, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 30.  After evaluating the protester’s past performance references, the agency assigned Sheela a confidence rating of “limited confidence.”  AR, Tab 21, Source Selection Decision at 3.   
 On March 12, 2025, the Air Force awarded MACCs to six offerors.
2  COS at 8.  On the 
same day, the Air Force notified Sheela that it was an unsuccessful offeror.  AR, Tab 22, Unsuccessful Offeror Letter at 2.  Sheela requested and received a written 
debriefing on March 13.  AR, Tab 23, Debrief at 1.  This protest follow ed on March 24.  
 DISCUSSION  Sheela raises multiple challenges to the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s proposal.  The protestor contends the Air Force’s evaluation of its past performance was unreasonable because the agency relied solely upon one negative Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) report and failed to consider the protestor’s 
rebuttal of the negative CPARS report.  Protest at 2- 3.  Additionally, the protester 
 
1 Past performance would be evaluated and assigned one of the following confidence 
assessment ratings:  substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral 
confidence, limited confidence, or no confidence.  RFP at 209- 210. 
2 The awardees are:  FBSG -GForce, Norristown, Pennsylvania; Ranco Construction Inc, 
Southampton, New Jersey; Benaka Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey; Eastern Construction, Wrightstown, New Jersey; Kaser Mechanical, LLC, Burlington, New Jersey; and Ritz Const ruction, Inc., Frederick, Maryland.  AR, Tab 22, Unsuccessful 
Offeror Letter at 2.   Page 3 B-423412  asserts that the Air Force’s decision to amend the solicitation after submission of 
proposals was improper.  Comments at 4- 5.  We have considered all the protester’s 
arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  
 Past Performance Evaluation  
 Sheela challenges the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s past performance.  Protest at 2.  According to Sheela, the agency improperly relied on a single negative CPARS report instead of more relevant CPARS reports with positive trends.  Id.   The agency responds 
that, consistent with the solicitation, the past performance evaluation was reasonable given Sheela’s marginal and unsatisfactory evaluations on recent and relevant CPARS reports.  MOL at 5.

 The solicitation instructed offerors to provide “a list of no more than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last five (5) years.”  RFP at 204.  The Air Force would evaluate the quality  of an offeror’s 
performance based on the recency and relevance of past performance information.  Id.

information available to the Government to assess present/past performance.”  Id.  
at 204.   
 Here, in evaluating the protester’s past performance, the agency accessed 28 recent CPARS reports for Sheela and reviewed the following categories for each report:  quality, schedule, cost control, management, small business subcontracting, and regulatory compliance.  COS at 5 -6.  The agency noted, across the categories for these 
reports, Sheela received three “marginal” ratings and one “unsatisfactory” rating.  Id. ; 
AR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at 1.  Three of the negative ratings were as sessed to Sheela’s performance on contract No. 47PC0220D0009.  AR, Tab 16, 
CPARS Reports at 1.  The contract was for cyclical upgrades to judge’s chambers,  Page 4 B-423412  which included tasks such as providing new carpeting, painting, wallcovering, wood 
refinishing, and floor mastic abatement remediation.  Id .  The protester received a rating 
of marginal under the schedule category, and the CPARS report indicated Sheela had “on many occasions” failed to provide a workable schedule, did not complete the project on time, and quality deficiencies led the government to issuing three extensions.  Id. 
at 3.   
 Sheela also received a rating of marginal in the regulatory compliance category 
because of the firm’s “multiple failures to comply with [ Homeland Security Presidential 
Directive 12 ] requirements, and also failure to comply with [New York City] regulations 
for asbestos abatement work.”  Id. at 8-9.  Finally, Sheela received a rating of 
unsatisfactory under the management category because, among other things, there were “numerous communications issues, lack of supervision on site and many coordination issues were present during the performance of this contract due to poor management.”  Id. at 5-8.  Ultimately, these negative assessments led the contracting 
officer for the report to not recommend Sheela for similar work in the future.  Id. at 9. 
 The last negative rating was found in the CPARS report for contract No. FA448420D0002.  Id.  at 13.  This contract was valued at $90,000,000 and was for work 
Sheela performed as an incumbent on the prior MACC.  Id.   Sheela received a rating of 
marginal under the management category for lack of supervision on the jobsite and other delays attributable to the contractor.  Id. at 16.  Based on this recent and relevant 
performance history, the evaluators concluded that Sheela’s past performance record supported “ a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage 
several task orders at the same time and successfully perform similar magnitudes 
described in the solicitation.”  MOL at 7.  
 Sheela does not dispute that the agency could consider CPARS ratings for past performance, nor does the protester dispute that the CPARS include the discussed negative assessments.  See  Comments at 1 -2.  Instead, the protestor argues that the 
agency unreasonably gave too much weight to a single negative CPARS report and effectively ignored multiple CPARS reports with positive outcomes.  Protest at 2 (“The agency’s reliance on one single CPARS report was unreasonable in light of Sheela’s multiple more recent , favorable CPARS . . .”).  Contrary to the protester’s contentions, 
the evaluation record demonstrates otherwise.   
 As the record makes clear, Sheela’s negative performance ratings were found in two separate CPARS reports, not one as the protester suggests.  More importantly, the record reflects that the agency reviewed not only the 28 CPARS reports pulled for Sheela, but the evaluators also reviewed the three past performance questionnaires (PPQ) submitted with Sheela’s proposal.  AR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at  1-4.  Ultimately, the evaluators concluded:  
 
The past performance provided for [Sheela] referenced essentially the same scope, magnitude and complexity to the effort described in the solicitation, resulting in three “Very Relevant” ratings.  However, when  Page 5 B-423412  considering the ratings of the past performance submitted via PPQs as

Government, and the several CPARS with very concerning performance ratings of Marginal and Unsatisfactory, the quality of [Sheela performance] is low.  As a result, a Limited Confidence rating is being assigned to 
[Sheela] as the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage several task orders at the same time and successfully  perform similar magnitudes described in the solicitation.  
 Id. at 3. 
 In other words, the agency considered both the protester’s positive and negative CPARS reports in assigning Sheela a rating of “limited confidence.”  Sheela disagrees with the agency’s past performance evaluation based on the protestor’s own judgment about  the weight that should be assigned to these performance reviews.  See  
Comments at 2.  While the protestor takes issue with the agency’s conclusion, this disagreement with the agency’s evaluation judgments, without more, does not demonstrate that those judgements were unreasonable or otherwise provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.  APC Constr., LLC, supra.  As such, we find no basis to 
object to the agency’s evaluation, and this allegation is denied.   
CPARS Rebuttal  
 Further, the protester argues that, under FAR section 42.1503(d), the agency was required--and failed--to consider Sheela’s rebuttal to its negative CPARS report when 
evaluating the firm’s past performance.  Protest at 2.  The agency responds that FAR 
section 42.1503(d) does not apply to the evaluations of offerors’ proposals and that, 
nonetheless, the Air Force did consider the CPARS rebuttal in the evaluation of Sheela’s past performance.  MOL at 7- 8. 
 Relevant here, section 42.1503(d) of the FAR provides:  
 
Contractors shall be afforded up to 14 calendar days from the date of notification of availability of the past performance evaluation to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information.  Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation.  The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. . . . These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions[.]  
 FAR 42.1503(d).  As the agency explains, the FAR provision does not govern the evaluation of an offeror’s past performance but, instead, pertains to the government’s “evaluation of a contractor’s performance of a [completed] contract and documenting that evaluation of the contractor’s performance for use in future source selections.”  MOL at 7.  We agree.   Page 6 B-423412   
Subpart 42.12 of the FAR “provides policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining contractor performance information.”  FAR 42.1500.  While the subpart acknowledges that “[p]ast performance information (including the ratings and supporting narratives) is relevant information for future source selection purposes,” nothing in the provision imposes any requirement with regards to what the agency must do with the information provided in a CPARS report.  FAR 42.1501(a); see generally  
FAR 42.15.   
 Nonetheless, even if the FAR provision afforded the protester some substantive right with regards to the agency’s evaluation of Sheela’s past performance--which it does not--the record reflects that the evaluators were aware of Sheela’s rebuttal to the 
negative CPARS report during the agency’s evaluation.   MOL at 7 (“[T]he Air Force was 
aware of Sheela’s response to its poor past performance ratings.”); AR, Tab 20, SSEB Report at 28.  Where, as here, an agency has considered reasonably available and relevant past performance information, its judgments regarding the relative merits of competing offerors’ past performance are primarily matters within the contracting agency’s discretion.  TPMC -Energy Solutions Envtl. Servs. 2009, LLC , B-408343.2 et 
al., Aug. 23, 2013, 2013 ¶ 215 at  8.  Given this record, we have no basis to conclude 
that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable or otherwise improper.  
 Remaining Challenges  
 Finally, the protester raises two new arguments for the first time in its comments to the 
agency report.   First, the protester alleges that the Air Force engaged in “a pattern of 
unfair treatment” against Sheela.  Comments at 4.  The protester’s only support for this assertion is that the Air Force did not select it for award in three prior unrelated procurements and that it has “witnesses who will testify” to the allegedly unfair treatment Sheela has suffered at the hands of unidentified individuals at the Air Force.  Id.    
 Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2;  K&K Industries, Inc. , B-420422, B -420422.2, Mar.  7, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 62 at  4.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity 
to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.  Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 
2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 260 at 4.  Our  regulations make clear  that protests other  than those 
challenging the terms of the solicitation must be filed within 10 days of when a protester 
knew, or should have known, of its basis for protest.  4  C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(2).  Where a 
protester initially files a timely protest, and later supplements it with independent grounds of protest, the later -raised allegations must independently satisfy the timeliness 
requirements, since our r egulations do not contemplate the unwarranted piecemeal 
presentation or development of protest issues.  Savvee Consulting, Inc. , B-408416.3, 
Mar. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 92 at 5.   
 Here, the protester knew the operative facts underlying this allegation prior to its initial protest , i.e., its non- selection on three prior procurements .  Thus, the information upon  Page 7 B-423412  which the protester based its new allegation in its comments w as known or should have 
been known prior to the filing of Sheela’s initial protest.  As we explained, our 
regulations do not contemplate the piecemeal presentation or development of protest 
issues through later submissions citing examples or providing alternate or more specific 
legal arguments missing from earlier general allegations of impropriety .  Id.  Because 
the protester waited until its comments to raise this new argument --which could have 
been raised in its initial protest --it is untimely and will not be considered.3  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(2); Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec. 18, 2019, 2020 CPD ¶ 8

Second, the protester alleges, also for the first time in its comments, that the agency’s 
“decision to amend the evaluation process after the submission of proposals without 
affording offerors the opportunity to review their submissions” deprived the firm of “the 
chance to adjust its submiss ion to meet any new or clarified administrative 
requirements.”  Comments at 4- 5.  We find this allegation also to be untimely.   
 Here, the solicitation was amended three times prior to the November 12 deadline for submission of proposals.  COS at  3; AR, Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 1.  On December 31, 
the agency issued amendment 4, notifying all offerors that submitted proposals by the November  12 due date.  AR, Tab 18, Amendment 4 at 1; COS at 3.  Amendment 4 did 
not extend the due date for the submission of proposals or otherwise allow for submission of proposal revisions.   
 
Our regulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation 
which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals 
shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.   4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(1).  Where alleged improprieties do not exist in the initial solicitation, but 
subsequently occur ( e.g., via an amendment to the solicitation), they generally must be 
protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals. Id .; ODL Servs. , 
B-421537 et al. , May 25, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 130 at 6.  I f no further submissions are 
anticipated, any alleged solicitation improprieties must be protested within 10 days of 
when the alleged impropriety was known or should have been known.   4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(1).  Because the time set for receipt of proposals had passed, Sheela was 
required to file any protest challenging the amended terms of the solicitation not later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of  the basis of 
the protest --which would have been January 10, 2025.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1); ODL  
  
 
3 Because we find the argument to be untimely, we need not address whether Sheela’s 
bare assertion states a factually and legally sufficient basis of protest, as required by our regulations .  See  4 C.F.R. §  21.1(c)(4) and (f) .    Page 8 B-423412  Servs. , B-421537 et al., supra.  Consequently, this allegation is similarly dismissed as 
untimely.    
 
The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 SOS International, LLC (SOSI), of Reston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) 
No. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information 
technology  support services for the Army’s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester 
contends that  the agency’s evaluation of proposals and source selection decision were 
unreasonable.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423366.2   BACKGROUND  
 
The Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army’s GCC.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 5 ; Agency  Report (AR), 
Tab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.
1  The 
solicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army’s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services multiple -award, indefinite-
delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation anticipated 
issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort  task order with a 1- month phase- in 
period, an  11-month base period of performance, three 1- year option periods, and one 
additional  6-month option.  Id.  at 2. 
 The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; 
(4) betterment; and (5) cost/price.  Id.  at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost/price 
factors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost/price factors, taken 
together, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation 
of the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign 
confidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the agency’s level of confidence that the offeror “ understands the requirement, proposes a 
sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .”  Id.  at 20.  The 
solicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence 
for any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. 
 
The solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 1-2.  Under phase I, 
offerors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  The solicitation  advised that only those 
offerors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.     
 Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and cost/price proposals and provide oral presentations.  Id.  at 11-18.  For oral presentations, offerors were required 
to “provide an oral presentation based on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.”  Id. at 16.  The solicitation 
stated that oral presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government.”  Id.   
The solicitation also noted that oral presentations were intended to be “an inter active 
exchange between the Offeror and the Government” and that these exchanges would

solicitation are to the final amended version of the TOPR provided in tab 25 of the 
agency report.  Citations to the agency report documents are to the internal page number s marked in the documents; for documents without consecutive page numbers, 
we cite to the Adobe PDF page numbers.   Page 3    B-423366.2   be “viewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute 
discussions.”  Id. at 17.  The agency would “not ask questions that will invite or allow the 
Offeror to change its Proposal” and warned offerors to “not volunteer any information that might be construed as changing [their] proposal.”  Id.  Oral presentations would be 
evaluated by assessing the government’s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements “based on the answers provided to the quest ions 
provided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.”  Id. at 20 .  As relevant here, the solicitation informed offerors that if an  
offeror did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral presentation, the offeror would not be considered for the award.   Id. at 18.   
 Seven offerors, including SOSI  and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS/MOL 
at 18.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the agency 
conducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for  offerors to update their phase I 
submissions.  Id. at 20; AR, Tab  45, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating 
the updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including SOSI  and 
Peraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II proposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  21; AR, Tab  55, Task 
Order Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   
 During each offeror’s oral presentation, the agency provided nine scenario- based 
questions, two hours to  prepare the presentation in response to the questions, and one 
hour to present the responses.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD  at 9-10.  Each offeror was 
asked one follow -up question “to clarify the technical team’s understanding of the 
Offeror’s answer to one of the questions.”  COS/MOL at  29; see generally, AR, Tab  60d, 
Contracting Officer ’s Oral Presentation Notes.  The agency decided not to record the 
oral pres entations , but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) 
took contemporaneous notes.   COS/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, 
Evaluators ’ Oral Presentation Notes.  Each PEB member individually evaluated  each 
oral presentation, identified findings, and assigned ratings for each answer to each of 
the nine questions.  COS/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, Evaluators’ Oral 
Presentation Notes; AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1, 9-11.  
Following the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors’ oral presentations .  COS/MOL at  21; see 
generally , AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report.  
 Following  the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of SOSI  and 
Peraton were assigned the following final ratings:  
 
 SOSI  Peraton  
Demonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Key Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Oral Presentation  Some  Confidence  High Confidence  
Betterment  1 1 
Total Evaluated Cost  $219,448,970  $225,089,343   Page 4    B-423366.2    
AR, Tab  55, TODD at  15, 33.   
 As relevant here, in assigning a rating of some confidence to SOSI’s oral presentation, the agency found that while the “[p]resentation was professional  and succinct ,” it 
“[r]eceived some confidence based on [the] knowledge, skills, and abilities 
demonstrated in responses to some [of the] technical and staffing approach questions 
and scenario- based questions.”  AR, Tab 54, Oral Presentation Consensus Evaluation 
at 7.  In this regard, a compilation of the evaluators’ assessments showed that all three 
evaluators assigned a rating of low or  some confidence for SOSI’s responses to five of 
the nine oral presentation questions.  Id. at 9-11. 
 The contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the technical evaluation reports and concurred with their findings.  AR, Tab  55, TODD 
at 1, 12.  Noting the provision in the solicitation that only proposals with the rating of 
high confidence under the oral presentation factor  would be considered for award, the 
SSA did not consider  SOSI’s proposal for award because of its oral presentation rating 
of some confidence.  Id.  at 34.  The SSA conducted a comparative tradeoff analysis 
between Peraton and another offeror , whose proposal received a rating of high 
confidence under the first three evaluation factors , and selected Peraton’s  proposal for 
award.  Id.  at 35-40.   
 The Army provided a debriefing to SOSI , and this protest followed.
2   
 DISCUSSION 
 
The protester argues that the agency’s evaluation of SOSI’s  oral presentation was 
unreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation, and undocumented.  Protest at  18-27.  
The protester also contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the protester’s betterment proposal, improperly failed to meaningfully  investigate and identify  the 
awardee’s organizational conflict of interest  (OCI), and unreasonably excluded SOSI’s  
proposal from the best -value tradeoff.
3  Id. at 27-38.  For the reasons discussed below, 
 
2 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this 
protest is within our Office’s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the 
authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
3 In its protest, SOSI also alleged that the agency unreasonably evaluated the 
awardee’s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor.  Protest at  34-35.  After 
reviewing the agency’s response to this allegation, see COS/MOL at 53-59, the 
protester stated that it is “not further pursuing its challenge to Peraton’s Key Personnel evaluation at this time.”  Comments at  35 n.8.  We therefore deem  this issue withdrawn.   Page 5    B-423366.2   we conclude that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester’s oral presentation and 
reasonably excluded SOSI’s proposal from further consideration.4     
 Oral Presentations  
 
The protester challenges the Army’s evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation, 
arguing that the agency’s conduct of the presentations departed from the solicitation 
and that the agency unreasonably criticized the protester’s technically sound solutions.
5  
Protest at  18-27; Comments at  16, 18- 25.  The protester also contends that the Army’s 
documentation of the oral presentation was inadequate because the agency  failed to 
document the actual oral presentations as presented, only retaining individual 
evaluators’ illegible and inconsistent notes.  Protest at  19-20; Comments at  17-18.  
The agency responds that it evaluated SOSI’s oral presentation reasonabl y and in 
accordance with the solicitation,  and that the evaluation was sufficiently documented.  
COS/MOL at 24-38.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to 
either the evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation or to the documentation of that 
evaluation.    As an initial matter, in challenging the agency’s documentation of the oral presentations, 
the protester relies in large part on our decisions in Connected Global Sols., LLC , 
B-418266.4, B -418266.7, Oct. 21, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 349, and HomeSafe Alliance, 
LLC, B-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  350.  See Protest at  19, 22; 
Comments at  17.  We find, however, that the protester’s reliance is misplaced because 
those decisions involved negotiated procurements under FAR part  15, while the 
procurement at i ssue here is a task order competition conducted under the procedures 
of FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task order competition 
under FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less 
rigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B -421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, 
2023, 2023 CPD ¶  90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., B-419210, B -419210.2, 
Dec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 409 at  4-5.   
 
In this regard, unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted 
under FAR part  15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral 
presentations in task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare FAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) 
provides that contracting officers may “exercise broad discretion in developing 
 
4 Although we do not discuss every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them all and find no basis to sustain the protest . 
5 The protester also asserts  that the agency departed from the solicitation by 
mechanically asking one follow -up question to each offeror when the solicitation stated 
that oral presentations would be an interactive exchange.  Comments at  16-17.  
Because the solicitation here did not require the agency to ask any specific number of questions or to inquire about all shortcomings observed in an offeror’s oral presentation, we find that the protester has not shown that the decision to ask one follow -up question 
of each offeror was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.    Page 6    B-423366.2   appropriate order placement procedures,” “keep submission requirements to a 
minimum,” and “use streamlined procedures including oral presentations.”  With respect to required documentation, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  requires contracting officers only 
to “document in the contract file the rationale for placement and price of each order, 
including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs among cost or price and 
non-cost considerations in making the award decision.”   
 Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government,” and, in fact,  the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16; 
see COS/MOL at  28.  The agency instead maintained its documentation of the oral 
presentations by retaining the contemporaneous handwritten notes of  the three 
technical evaluators and the contracting officer , and then convening  a panel to prepare 
a consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  28; see generally,  AR, 
Tab 54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report ; AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, 60d, 
Evaluators ’ Oral Presentation Notes.
6   
 Based on our review of this record, we find that  the agency’s evaluative assessment of 
the offerors’ oral presentations  was sufficiently documented.  While the evaluators’ 
notes do not document every aspect of the offerors’ oral presentations, they do provide the agency’s documentation of the particular aspects of the offerors’ presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluative judgments .
7  Where the solicitation 
specifically advised offerors that the agency may not record the oral presentations, we see no applicable law or regulation that required the agency to have gone further and 
record or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR subpart  16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., 
LLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, Nov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 365 at 7 (“We see 
no requirement in law or regulation that an agency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart  8.4, and it is not our role 
to impose one where the FAR does not.”) . 
 The protester next challenges the evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation itself.  
In this regard, t he protester asserts  that the agency unreasonably evaluated the 
 
6 In response of the protester’s complaint that  parts of the individual evaluators’ notes 
were “virtually illegible,”  Comments at  18, our Office requested that the agency provide 
typed transcriptions of the evaluators’ handwritten notes, and the agency supplemented the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  60a(1), 60b(1), 60c(1), 
Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes.  
7 We also reject the protester’s assertion that the agency’s  documentation is inadequate 
because the content of the evaluators’ notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments at  18, 24.  It is 
well-settled that, following discussions among evaluators, an agency may reach 
consensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator’s asse ssment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; see e.g. , Unitec Distribution 
Sys., B-419874, B -419874.2, Aug. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  307 at  4.   Page 7    B-423366.2   protester’s responses to five of the nine oral presentation questions  by penalizing SOSI 
for failing to address issues not reasonably encompassed by the questions asked,  and 
by failing to give sufficient credit for aspects  that SOSI fully addressed in its oral 
presentation.   Protest at  20-27; Comments at  18-25.  The protester also contends that 
the agency unreasonably  failed to consider the protester’s response to the agency’s  
follow- up question.  Comments at  16-17. 
 
The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc., 
B-419271.5 et al., Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  191 at  7.  In reviewing a protest 
challenging an agency’s technical evaluation, our Office does not independently evaluate proposals; rather, we review the agency’s evaluation to ensure that it is consistent wi th the terms of the solicitation and applicable statutes and regulations.

solicitation .  Id.; Data Matrix Sols., Inc., B -412520, Mar.  14, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶  87 at  5.  
A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment regarding the evaluation of propos als, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted 
unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  
 Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation 
of the protester’s oral presentation.   While  the protester challenges the agency’s 
assessment of the protester’s responses to five of the nine oral presentation questions , 
the record shows that the evaluators reasonably assigned low or some confidence ratings  for failing to address certain required aspects of the questions asked.  W e 
discuss below two of the responses  as representative examples.  
 For question number  2, the agency asked offerors to address how they would provide 
Army.mil / Army365 tenant management and support within the enterprise services division under PWS section 3.3.  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The 
agency summarized its evaluation of the protester’s response as follows:  
 
The offeror focused on management/procedural implementations for the technical  scenario, but did not provide any technological solutions.  The 
offeror provided examples  for use of data displayed in a visual, digestible 
format, however, the examples were for  internal administration and not 
focused on improving the user experience.   The example given for a 
Power Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.   
 AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI’s presentation for 
question 2 received one rating of some confidence and two ratings of low confidence 
from the individual evaluators.   Id. at 9. 
  Page 8    B-423366.2   The protester  asserts that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable because the 
question “did not request a technical solution” but instead was “focused on our process 
for providing a project plan.”  Protest at  23; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. 
at 4.  The protester also argues that the question “did not indicate that the Army wanted 
to understand the ‘user experience’ of external customers  as opposed to those involved 
in internal administration.”  Protest at  23.  In this regard, the protester recalls question 2 
to be about “how [SOSI] would implement a large- scale project plan for  Directory 
Services” and asserts that its response properly “focused on using continuous service 
improvement [] --enabled by continual collaboration with” its GCC mission partner.8  Id.; 
Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  3.   
 
The agency responds  that the protester’s recollection of question 2 was incomplete and  
therefore the firm’s assessment of the sufficiency of its response was likewise  flawed.  
COS/MOL at 31-32.  The record shows that question 2 asked as follows : 
 
Provide Army.mil / Army365 Tenant Management and Support detailed within the PWS under Enterprise Services Division Support paragraph 3.3 
and related sub- paragraphs.  What are the specific steps you would take 
to manage current Army Unified Directory Service functions to support a 
global user base commitment?  How would you organize, prioritize, and 
manage the diverse, parallel, and time- minded DevOps activities 
associated with supporting the global userbase?  What are the specific 
steps you currently take to gather, develop, and maintain metrics and dashboards for virtualization data?  Describe how you have employed 
tools such as Microsoft’s  Power [Business Intelligence] , Microsoft Power 
Apps, and Elastic to improve the end user’s experience.  
 AR, Tab  62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The agency argues that, given the 
actual question asked, the evaluators reasonably assessed the protester’s response with low to some confidence for failing to provide a technical solution that addressed end-user experience.  COS/MOL at  32. 
 On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation on question 2.  First, contrary to the protester’s recollection, the record 
shows that question 2 clearly sought a technical solution.  Specifically, the question 
asked the offeror to address  Army365 tenant management and support services under 
PWS section 3.3, which requires the contractor to “[a]ssess service -based alerts, 
develop/determine Enterprise mission impact, report significant outages, and develop technical/non- technical alerts to the filed.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  14-15.  In addition, the 
question pointedly required the offeror  to address how it would “support the global user 
 
8 Because the agency’s debriefing to SOSI did not provide a copy of the oral 
presentation questions, SOSI’s protest allegations were based on “the best of SOSI’s recollection” of the questions and SOSI’s responses , as recalled by  SOSI’s corporate 
representative who attended the oral presentation.  See Protest at 21; Protest exh.  12, 
SOSI Representative Decl. at  1.  Page 9    B-423366.2   base” and “improve the end user’s experience.”  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation 
Questions at  1.  In fact, by asserting that the agency’s  question did not ask for a 
technical solution or to address end- user experience, the protester  belies any assertion 
that its response to this question did address these aspects.   See Protest, exh.  12, 
SOSI Representative Decl. at  3-4.   
 
Moreover, the evaluators’ contemporaneous notes consistently documented that SOSI’s 
response to this question did not provide the required technical solutions and failed to 
focus on improving user experience.  See AR, Tab  60a(1), Transcribed Oral 
Presentation Notes  of Evaluator  A at 1 (“Offeror provided management solutions but no 
technical options.  Discussions of tools were not focused on improving user experience.”); AR, Tab 60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes  of Evaluator C at  1 
(“provided [management] solution to a tech problem. Did not give clear example at improving end user experience, only for [contractor] community.”) .  On this record , we 
find unobjectionable the agency’s consensus conclusion that the protester’s 
presentation for question 2 “did not provide any technological solutions ” and was  “not 
focused on improving the user experience. ”  AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Consensus 
Evaluation at  7, 9. 
 The protester also argues that the agency ’s evaluation unreasonably failed to consider 
additional information that SOSI provided, bearing on question 2,  in response to the 
agency’s follow -up question.  Protest at  23; Comments at  20-21.  In this regard, the 
protester recall s that the follow- up question asked SOSI to “provide other examples for 
how [it] would apply a project plan for Directory Services”  and asserts that SOSI 
responded to the question with the required information.   Id.; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI  
Representative Decl. at  3-4.  The record, however,  show s that the actual follow -up 
question asked SOSI to “expand upon how [ it] ha[s] employed tools such as Microsoft ’s 
Power [Business Intelligence], Microsoft Power apps, and Elastic to improve the end user’s experience. ”  AR, Tab 60d, CO Notes at  4.   
 The protester maintains that  the agency nevertheless failed to consider its response to 
the question in the overall assessment of SOSI’s oral presentation.   Comments at  21.  
We find no basis in the record to support the protester’s position.   In this regard, after 
reviewing the record (including the documentation of the follow -up question and the 
evaluators’ notes ), the protester  now asserts  that its follow -up response “necessarily 
included a discussion of the user experience and additional information about using Microsoft Power [Business Intelligence] and the other tools .”  Id.  This assertion, 
however,  is contradicted by the initial recollection of SOSI’s own representative who 
participated in the oral presentation.  S ee Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. 
at 4.  Specifically , SOSI’s representative recall ed that SOSI’s response to the follow- up 
question addressed how it uses  “an internally developed SOS [I] application that 
provides customers and stakeholders with project status dashboards (using Microsoft 
Power [Business Intelligence]) for large- scale projects .”  Id.  He further recall ed that 
SOSI explained that this application “gives customers and stakeholders transparency into the status of all program aspects, including the status of deliverables, metrics on cybersecurity status and posture, and other program metrics.”  Id.   Notably, this  Page 10    B-423366.2   recollection did not mention whether SOSI’s response included improving the end-user 
experience  despite this  issue  being flagged during SOSI’s debriefing.   See AR, Tab  57, 
Post-Award Debriefing Slides at  27.  In fact, as noted above, the protester initially 
argued that question 2 and the follow -up question did not ask SOSI to address end- user 
experiences.  See  Protest at  23. 
 
Consistent with the protester’s initial recollection of its responses to question 2 and the 
follow- up question, t he evaluators found that SOSI “provided examples for use of data 
displayed in a visual, digestible format, however, the examples were for internal administration and not focused on improving the user experience.”  AR, Tab  54, Oral 
Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  The agency  also found that the example 
SOSI gave for a “Power Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.”  Id.  As noted, these findings were also 
supported by the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the evaluators.  See AR, 
Tab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab 60c(1), 
Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator C at  1.  The agency’s consensus 
evaluation of SOSI’s response to question 2, therefore, is consistent not only with the 
individual evaluators’ contemporaneous record of SOSI’s oral presentation, but also with the protester’s recollection of the response SOSI  provided to the follow -up 
question.  To the extent the protester disagrees with the agency’s assessment of the 
merits of the protester’s oral presentation, such disagreement, without more, is not 
sufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network 
Servs., Inc., supra .  
 As another example, question number 3 asked offerors to “describe how [they] would 
construct a zero trust administrative model” for a specified scenario requiring 
administrative access to end- user devices , and to “[i]ncorporate any commercially 
available Microsoft Azure and/or Entra ID feature configurations to describe [the] proposed design.”  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The protester object s 
to the agency’s evaluation of SOSI’s response to question 3, in which the agency found 
as follows : 
 
This scenario- based question was specific to a public cloud infrastructure, 
but the offeror answered the question from the perspective of a traditional Active Directory environment.  The offeror identified some key principles necessary for Azure Entra- ID m anagement, but the response was not 
holistically focused on a public cloud as the scenario required.  The offeror 
did not discuss using attribute- based access controls (which was 
mentioned in the description of Entra- ID) to include objects into 
Administrat ive Units where access would be delegated or denied as 
appropriate.  
 
AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI’s presentation for 
question 3 received two  ratings of some confidence and one rating of low confidence 
from the individual evaluators .  Id. at 9. 
  Page 11    B-423366.2   SOSI argues  that the agency’s criticism  mischaracterizes SOSI’s presentation and 
“does not track” the question asked.  Protest  at 24; Comments at  21-22.  We  find that 
the protester’s assertions  are not supported by the record.  
 
In its initial protest filing, the protester  relies on its representative’s  recollection  to assert 
that SOSI’s response to question 3 “addressed . . . cloud- specific security on a public 
cloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for cloud- native security controls --essential 
for implementing Zero Trust in such environments.”   Protest at  24, citing Protest, 
exh. 12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  5.  The  contemporaneous notes  of the agency’s 
evaluators , however, consistently  documented that SOSI’s response to question 3 
“[d]iscussed implementation in a traditional [active directory] forest, not cloud” and “didn’t fully cover cloud env[ironment].”  AR, Tab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation 
Notes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab  60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of 
Evaluator C at  2.  Moreover, while  the protester initially  assert ed that the question “did 
not ask specifically about Azure Entra- ID management ,” Protest at 24, the record shows 
that the question specifically ask ed that the offeror’s proposed solution “[i] ncorporate 
any commercially  available Microsoft Azure and/or Entra ID feature configurations .”  AR, 
Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.   
 After reviewing the agency report (which  included the evaluator s’ notes  and the oral 
presentation questions provided to offerors ), the protester argues  that question 3 “does 
not ask offerors to address this issue from a cloud perspective” because “the word 
‘cloud’ does not even appear in the question.”  Comments at  22.  This new argument, 
however, contradicts  both its prior  declaration recalling that  question 3 was “a 
scenario- based question which related to zero- trust implementation of directory services 
on a public cloud infrastructure”  and its  initial assertion that its presentation “addressed 
. . . cloud- specific security on a public cloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for 
cloud- native security controls .”  Protest at  24; Protest, exh. 12, SOSI Representative 
Decl. at  5 (emphasis added) .  Further, question 3 specifically  asked offerors to 
incorporate “Microsoft Azure and/or Entra ID,” which are a cloud computing platform and a cloud- based access management  service , respectively.  See  
https://azure.microsoft.com/en -us/resources/cloud- computing- dictionary/what -is-azure 
(last visited June 2, 2025); https://learn.microsoft.com/en -us/entra/fundamentals/whatis  
(last visited June 2, 2025) .  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably  assigned 
low to some confidence ratings  for the protester’s response to question 3 for, among 
other things, failing to propose a cloud- based solution as required.  
 In sum, based on our review of the record, including the contemporaneous evaluator notes, we find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation of SOSI’s oral presentation.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.   
 Remaining Challenges  
 SOSI also  challenges  the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s proposal under the 
betterment factor  and argues that the agency unreasonably excluded the proposal from 
the best -value tradeoff analysis.  Protest at  27-30, 35- 38.  The protester also argues  Page 12    B-423366.2   that the agency unreasonably failed to meaningfully investigate and identify  the 
awardee’s OCI.  Id. at 30-33.  As noted above, the solicitation stated that a proposal 
rated low or some confidence for the oral presentation factor would not be considered 
for award.  TOPR at  18.  Because we find that the agency reasonably  excluded the 
protester’s proposal  from further consideration based on the rating of some confidence 
assigned to SOSI’s oral presentation,  we find that  the protester  was not competitively 
prejudiced by any errors with respect to other aspects of the agency’s evaluation of 
SOSI ’s proposal .  In this regard, even if the protester could show that other aspects of 
the evaluation of its proposal were unreasonable, its proposal was properly eliminated from further consideration for award.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where n one is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a 
protest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency’s actions arguably 
were improper.  Zolon PCS, LLC , B-419283, Jan.  14, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  26 at  8; 
VSolvit, LLC, supra.  at 6.   
 SOSI is also not an interested party to challenge the agency’s evaluation of Peraton’s proposal.  In order for a protest to be considered by our Office, a protester must be an interested party, meaning it must have a direct economic interest in the resolut ion of a 
protest issue.  4 C.F.R. § 21.0(a).  A protester is an interested party to challenge the 
evaluation of an awardee’s proposal only where there is a reasonable possibility that the protester’s proposal would be in line for award if the protest were to be sustained.  
Verisys Corp. , B-413204.5 et al., Oct. 2, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  338 at  13.  Where there is 
an acceptable offeror that would be in line for the award ahead of the protester if the protester’s challenge to the award were to be sustained, the protester’s interest is too remote to qualify as an interested party.  SRA Int'l, Inc.; NTT DATA Servs. Fed. Gov't, 
Inc., B-413220.4 et al., May 19, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  173 at  28.  Here, there was another 
technically acceptable offeror whose proposal received the rating of high confidence under each of the first three non- cost/price evaluation factors.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD 
at 35.  This offer or’s proposal would be next in line for award if SOSI’s allegations were 
sustained.  Accordingly, based on our conclusion that the agency reasonably found SOSI’s proposal ineligible for award, we conclude that SOSI is not an interested party to challenge the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s proposal because it would not be in line for contract award were its protest to be sustained.

sufficiently documented.  
 2.

DECISION  
 SOS International, LLC (SOSI), of Reston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) 
No. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information 
technology  support services for the Army’s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester 
contends that  the agency’s evaluation of proposals and source selection decision were 
unreasonable.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423366.2   BACKGROUND  
 
The Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army’s GCC.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 5 ; Agency  Report (AR), 
Tab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.
1  The 
solicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army’s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services multiple -award, indefinite-
delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation anticipated 
issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort  task order with a 1- month phase- in 
period, an  11-month base period of performance, three 1- year option periods, and one 
additional  6-month option.  Id.  at 2. 
 The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; 
(4) betterment; and (5) cost/price.  Id.  at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost/price 
factors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost/price factors, taken 
together, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation 
of the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign 
confidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the agency’s level of confidence that the offeror “ understands the requirement, proposes a 
sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .”  Id.  at 20.  The 
solicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence 
for any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. 
 
The solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 1-2.  Under phase I, 
offerors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  The solicitation  advised that only those 
offerors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.     
 Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and cost/price proposals and provide oral presentations.  Id.  at 11-18.  For oral presentations, offerors were required 
to “provide an oral presentation based on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.”  Id. at 16.  The solicitation 
stated that oral presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government.”  Id.   
The solicitation also noted that oral presentations were intended to be “an inter active 
exchange between the Offeror and the Government” and that these exchanges would

solicitation are to the final amended version of the TOPR provided in tab 25 of the 
agency report.  Citations to the agency report documents are to the internal page number s marked in the documents; for documents without consecutive page numbers, 
we cite to the Adobe PDF page numbers.   Page 3    B-423366.2   be “viewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute 
discussions.”  Id. at 17.  The agency would “not ask questions that will invite or allow the 
Offeror to change its Proposal” and warned offerors to “not volunteer any information that might be construed as changing [their] proposal.”  Id.  Oral presentations would be 
evaluated by assessing the government’s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements “based on the answers provided to the quest ions 
provided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.”  Id. at 20 .  As relevant here, the solicitation informed offerors that if an  
offeror did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral presentation, the offeror would not be considered for the award.   Id. at 18.   
 Seven offerors, including SOSI  and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS/MOL 
at 18.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the agency 
conducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for  offerors to update their phase I 
submissions.  Id. at 20; AR, Tab  45, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating 
the updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including SOSI  and 
Peraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II proposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  21; AR, Tab  55, Task 
Order Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   
 During each offeror’s oral presentation, the agency provided nine scenario- based 
questions, two hours to  prepare the presentation in response to the questions, and one 
hour to present the responses.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD  at 9-10.  Each offeror was 
asked one follow -up question “to clarify the technical team’s understanding of the 
Offeror’s answer to one of the questions.”  COS/MOL at  29; see generally, AR, Tab  60d, 
Contracting Officer ’s Oral Presentation Notes.  The agency decided not to record the 
oral pres entations , but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) 
took contemporaneous notes.   COS/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, 
Evaluators ’ Oral Presentation Notes.  Each PEB member individually evaluated  each 
oral presentation, identified findings, and assigned ratings for each answer to each of 
the nine questions.  COS/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, Evaluators’ Oral 
Presentation Notes; AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1, 9-11.  
Following the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors’ oral presentations .  COS/MOL at  21; see 
generally , AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report.  
 Following  the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of SOSI  and 
Peraton were assigned the following final ratings:  
 
 SOSI  Peraton  
Demonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Key Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Oral Presentation  Some  Confidence  High Confidence  
Betterment  1 1 
Total Evaluated Cost  $219,448,970  $225,089,343   Page 4    B-423366.2    
AR, Tab  55, TODD at  15, 33.   
 As relevant here, in assigning a rating of some confidence to SOSI’s oral presentation, the agency found that while the “[p]resentation was professional  and succinct ,” it 
“[r]eceived some confidence based on [the] knowledge, skills, and abilities 
demonstrated in responses to some [of the] technical and staffing approach questions 
and scenario- based questions.”  AR, Tab 54, Oral Presentation Consensus Evaluation 
at 7.  In this regard, a compilation of the evaluators’ assessments showed that all three 
evaluators assigned a rating of low or  some confidence for SOSI’s responses to five of 
the nine oral presentation questions.  Id. at 9-11. 
 The contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the technical evaluation reports and concurred with their findings.  AR, Tab  55, TODD 
at 1, 12.  Noting the provision in the solicitation that only proposals with the rating of 
high confidence under the oral presentation factor  would be considered for award, the 
SSA did not consider  SOSI’s proposal for award because of its oral presentation rating 
of some confidence.  Id.  at 34.  The SSA conducted a comparative tradeoff analysis 
between Peraton and another offeror , whose proposal received a rating of high 
confidence under the first three evaluation factors , and selected Peraton’s  proposal for 
award.  Id.  at 35-40.   
 The Army provided a debriefing to SOSI , and this protest followed.
2   
 DISCUSSION 
 
The protester argues that the agency’s evaluation of SOSI’s  oral presentation was 
unreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation, and undocumented.  Protest at  18-27.  
The protester also contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the protester’s betterment proposal, improperly failed to meaningfully  investigate and identify  the 
awardee’s organizational conflict of interest  (OCI), and unreasonably excluded SOSI’s  
proposal from the best -value tradeoff.
3  Id. at 27-38.  For the reasons discussed below, 
 
2 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this 
protest is within our Office’s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the 
authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
3 In its protest, SOSI also alleged that the agency unreasonably evaluated the 
awardee’s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor.  Protest at  34-35.  After 
reviewing the agency’s response to this allegation, see COS/MOL at 53-59, the 
protester stated that it is “not further pursuing its challenge to Peraton’s Key Personnel evaluation at this time.”  Comments at  35 n.8.  We therefore deem  this issue withdrawn.   Page 5    B-423366.2   we conclude that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester’s oral presentation and 
reasonably excluded SOSI’s proposal from further consideration.4     
 Oral Presentations  
 
The protester challenges the Army’s evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation, 
arguing that the agency’s conduct of the presentations departed from the solicitation 
and that the agency unreasonably criticized the protester’s technically sound solutions.
5  
Protest at  18-27; Comments at  16, 18- 25.  The protester also contends that the Army’s 
documentation of the oral presentation was inadequate because the agency  failed to 
document the actual oral presentations as presented, only retaining individual 
evaluators’ illegible and inconsistent notes.  Protest at  19-20; Comments at  17-18.  
The agency responds that it evaluated SOSI’s oral presentation reasonabl y and in 
accordance with the solicitation,  and that the evaluation was sufficiently documented.  
COS/MOL at 24-38.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to 
either the evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation or to the documentation of that 
evaluation.    As an initial matter, in challenging the agency’s documentation of the oral presentations, 
the protester relies in large part on our decisions in Connected Global Sols., LLC , 
B-418266.4, B -418266.7, Oct. 21, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 349, and HomeSafe Alliance, 
LLC, B-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  350.  See Protest at  19, 22; 
Comments at  17.  We find, however, that the protester’s reliance is misplaced because 
those decisions involved negotiated procurements under FAR part  15, while the 
procurement at i ssue here is a task order competition conducted under the procedures 
of FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task order competition 
under FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less 
rigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B -421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, 
2023, 2023 CPD ¶  90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., B-419210, B -419210.2, 
Dec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 409 at  4-5.   
 
In this regard, unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted 
under FAR part  15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral 
presentations in task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare FAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) 
provides that contracting officers may “exercise broad discretion in developing 
 
4 Although we do not discuss every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them all and find no basis to sustain the protest . 
5 The protester also asserts  that the agency departed from the solicitation by 
mechanically asking one follow -up question to each offeror when the solicitation stated 
that oral presentations would be an interactive exchange.  Comments at  16-17.  
Because the solicitation here did not require the agency to ask any specific number of questions or to inquire about all shortcomings observed in an offeror’s oral presentation, we find that the protester has not shown that the decision to ask one follow -up question 
of each offeror was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.    Page 6    B-423366.2   appropriate order placement procedures,” “keep submission requirements to a 
minimum,” and “use streamlined procedures including oral presentations.”  With respect to required documentation, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  requires contracting officers only 
to “document in the contract file the rationale for placement and price of each order, 
including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs among cost or price and 
non-cost considerations in making the award decision.”   
 Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government,” and, in fact,  the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16; 
see COS/MOL at  28.  The agency instead maintained its documentation of the oral 
presentations by retaining the contemporaneous handwritten notes of  the three 
technical evaluators and the contracting officer , and then convening  a panel to prepare 
a consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  28; see generally,  AR, 
Tab 54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report ; AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, 60d, 
Evaluators ’ Oral Presentation Notes.
6   
 Based on our review of this record, we find that  the agency’s evaluative assessment of 
the offerors’ oral presentations  was sufficiently documented.  While the evaluators’ 
notes do not document every aspect of the offerors’ oral presentations, they do provide the agency’s documentation of the particular aspects of the offerors’ presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluative judgments .
7  Where the solicitation 
specifically advised offerors that the agency may not record the oral presentations, we see no applicable law or regulation that required the agency to have gone further and 
record or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR subpart  16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., 
LLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, Nov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 365 at 7 (“We see 
no requirement in law or regulation that an agency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart  8.4, and it is not our role 
to impose one where the FAR does not.”) . 
 The protester next challenges the evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation itself.  
In this regard, t he protester asserts  that the agency unreasonably evaluated the 
 
6 In response of the protester’s complaint that  parts of the individual evaluators’ notes 
were “virtually illegible,”  Comments at  18, our Office requested that the agency provide 
typed transcriptions of the evaluators’ handwritten notes, and the agency supplemented the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  60a(1), 60b(1), 60c(1),

7 We also reject the protester’s assertion that the agency’s  documentation is inadequate 
because the content of the evaluators’ notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments at  18, 24.  It is 
well-settled that, following discussions among evaluators, an agency may reach 
consensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator’s asse ssment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; see e.g. , Unitec Distribution

for failing to address issues not reasonably encompassed by the questions asked,  and 
by failing to give sufficient credit for aspects  that SOSI fully addressed in its oral 
presentation.   Protest at  20-27; Comments at  18-25.  The protester also contends that 
the agency unreasonably  failed to consider the protester’s response to the agency’s  
follow- up question.  Comments at  16-17. 
 
The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc.,

A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment regarding the evaluation of propos als, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted 
unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  
 Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation 
of the protester’s oral presentation.   While  the protester challenges the agency’s 
assessment of the protester’s responses to five of the nine oral presentation questions , 
the record shows that the evaluators reasonably assigned low or some confidence ratings  for failing to address certain required aspects of the questions asked.  W e 
discuss below two of the responses  as representative examples.  
 For question number  2, the agency asked offerors to address how they would provide 
Army.mil / Army365 tenant management and support within the enterprise services division under PWS section 3.3.  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The 
agency summarized its evaluation of the protester’s response as follows:  
 
The offeror focused on management/procedural implementations for the technical  scenario, but did not provide any technological solutions.  The 
offeror provided examples  for use of data displayed in a visual, digestible 
format, however, the examples were for  internal administration and not 
focused on improving the user experience.   The example given for a 
Power Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.   
 AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI’s presentation for 
question 2 received one rating of some confidence and two ratings of low confidence 
from the individual evaluators.   Id. at 9. 
  Page 8    B-423366.2   The protester  asserts that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable because the 
question “did not request a technical solution” but instead was “focused on our process 
for providing a project plan.”  Protest at  23; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. 
at 4.  The protester also argues that the question “did not indicate that the Army wanted 
to understand the ‘user experience’ of external customers  as opposed to those involved 
in internal administration.”  Protest at  23.  In this regard, the protester recalls question 2 
to be about “how [SOSI] would implement a large- scale project plan for  Directory 
Services” and asserts that its response properly “focused on using continuous service 
improvement [] --enabled by continual collaboration with” its GCC mission partner.8  Id.; 
Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  3.   
 
The agency responds  that the protester’s recollection of question 2 was incomplete and  
therefore the firm’s assessment of the sufficiency of its response was likewise  flawed.  
COS/MOL at 31-32.  The record shows that question 2 asked as follows : 
 
Provide Army.mil / Army365 Tenant Management and Support detailed within the PWS under Enterprise Services Division Support paragraph 3.3 
and related sub- paragraphs.  What are the specific steps you would take 
to manage current Army Unified Directory Service functions to support a 
global user base commitment?  How would you organize, prioritize, and 
manage the diverse, parallel, and time- minded DevOps activities 
associated with supporting the global userbase?  What are the specific 
steps you currently take to gather, develop, and maintain metrics and dashboards for virtualization data?  Describe how you have employed 
tools such as Microsoft’s  Power [Business Intelligence] , Microsoft Power 
Apps, and Elastic to improve the end user’s experience.  
 AR, Tab  62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The agency argues that, given the 
actual question asked, the evaluators reasonably assessed the protester’s response with low to some confidence for failing to provide a technical solution that addressed end-user experience.  COS/MOL at  32. 
 On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s oral presentation on question 2.  First, contrary to the protester’s recollection, the record 
shows that question 2 clearly sought a technical solution.  Specifically, the question 
asked the offeror to address  Army365 tenant management and support services under 
PWS section 3.3, which requires the contractor to “[a]ssess service -based alerts, 
develop/determine Enterprise mission impact, report significant outages, and develop technical/non- technical alerts to the filed.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  14-15.  In addition, the 
question pointedly required the offeror  to address how it would “support the global user 
 
8 Because the agency’s debriefing to SOSI did not provide a copy of the oral 
presentation questions, SOSI’s protest allegations were based on “the best of SOSI’s recollection” of the questions and SOSI’s responses , as recalled by  SOSI’s corporate 
representative who attended the oral presentation.  See Protest at 21; Protest exh.  12, 
SOSI Representative Decl. at  1.  Page 9    B-423366.2   base” and “improve the end user’s experience.”  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation 
Questions at  1.  In fact, by asserting that the agency’s  question did not ask for a 
technical solution or to address end- user experience, the protester  belies any assertion 
that its response to this question did address these aspects.   See Protest, exh.  12, 
SOSI Representative Decl. at  3-4.   
 
Moreover, the evaluators’ contemporaneous notes consistently documented that SOSI’s 
response to this question did not provide the required technical solutions and failed to 
focus on improving user experience.  See AR, Tab  60a(1), Transcribed Oral 
Presentation Notes  of Evaluator  A at 1 (“Offeror provided management solutions but no 
technical options.  Discussions of tools were not focused on improving user experience.”); AR, Tab 60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes  of Evaluator C at  1 
(“provided [management] solution to a tech problem. Did not give clear example at improving end user experience, only for [contractor] community.”) .  On this record , we 
find unobjectionable the agency’s consensus conclusion that the protester’s 
presentation for question 2 “did not provide any technological solutions ” and was  “not 
focused on improving the user experience. ”  AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Consensus 
Evaluation at  7, 9. 
 The protester also argues that the agency ’s evaluation unreasonably failed to consider 
additional information that SOSI provided, bearing on question 2,  in response to the 
agency’s follow -up question.  Protest at  23; Comments at  20-21.  In this regard, the 
protester recall s that the follow- up question asked SOSI to “provide other examples for 
how [it] would apply a project plan for Directory Services”  and asserts that SOSI 
responded to the question with the required information.   Id.; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI  
Representative Decl. at  3-4.  The record, however,  show s that the actual follow -up 
question asked SOSI to “expand upon how [ it] ha[s] employed tools such as Microsoft ’s 
Power [Business Intelligence], Microsoft Power apps, and Elastic to improve the end user’s experience. ”  AR, Tab 60d, CO Notes at  4.   
 The protester maintains that  the agency nevertheless failed to consider its response to 
the question in the overall assessment of SOSI’s oral presentation.   Comments at  21.  
We find no basis in the record to support the protester’s position.   In this regard, after 
reviewing the record (including the documentation of the follow -up question and the 
evaluators’ notes ), the protester  now asserts  that its follow -up response “necessarily 
included a discussion of the user experience and additional information about using Microsoft Power [Business Intelligence] and the other tools .”  Id.  This assertion, 
however,  is contradicted by the initial recollection of SOSI’s own representative who 
participated in the oral presentation.  S ee Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. 
at 4.  Specifically , SOSI’s representative recall ed that SOSI’s response to the follow- up 
question addressed how it uses  “an internally developed SOS [I] application that 
provides customers and stakeholders with project status dashboards (using Microsoft 
Power [Business Intelligence]) for large- scale projects .”  Id.  He further recall ed that 
SOSI explained that this application “gives customers and stakeholders transparency into the status of all program aspects, including the status of deliverables, metrics on cybersecurity status and posture, and other program metrics.”  Id.   Notably, this  Page 10    B-423366.2   recollection did not mention whether SOSI’s response included improving the end-user 
experience  despite this  issue  being flagged during SOSI’s debriefing.   See AR, Tab  57, 
Post-Award Debriefing Slides at  27.  In fact, as noted above, the protester initially 
argued that question 2 and the follow -up question did not ask SOSI to address end- user 
experiences.  See  Protest at  23. 
 
Consistent with the protester’s initial recollection of its responses to question 2 and the 
follow- up question, t he evaluators found that SOSI “provided examples for use of data 
displayed in a visual, digestible format, however, the examples were for internal administration and not focused on improving the user experience.”  AR, Tab  54, Oral 
Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  The agency  also found that the example 
SOSI gave for a “Power Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.”  Id.  As noted, these findings were also 
supported by the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the evaluators.  See AR, 
Tab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab 60c(1), 
Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator C at  1.  The agency’s consensus 
evaluation of SOSI’s response to question 2, therefore, is consistent not only with the 
individual evaluators’ contemporaneous record of SOSI’s oral presentation, but also with the protester’s recollection of the response SOSI  provided to the follow -up 
question.  To the extent the protester disagrees with the agency’s assessment of the 
merits of the protester’s oral presentation, such disagreement, without more, is not 
sufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network 
Servs., Inc., supra .  
 As another example, question number 3 asked offerors to “describe how [they] would 
construct a zero trust administrative model” for a specified scenario requiring 
administrative access to end- user devices , and to “[i]ncorporate any commercially 
available Microsoft Azure and/or Entra ID feature configurations to describe [the] proposed design.”  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The protester object s 
to the agency’s evaluation of SOSI’s response to question 3, in which the agency found 
as follows : 
 
This scenario- based question was specific to a public cloud infrastructure, 
but the offeror answered the question from the perspective of a traditional Active Directory environment.  The offeror identified some key principles necessary for Azure Entra- ID m anagement, but the response was not 
holistically focused on a public cloud as the scenario required.  The offeror 
did not discuss using attribute- based access controls (which was 
mentioned in the description of Entra- ID) to include objects into 
Administrat ive Units where access would be delegated or denied as 
appropriate.  
 
AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI’s presentation for 
question 3 received two  ratings of some confidence and one rating of low confidence 
from the individual evaluators .  Id. at 9. 
  Page 11    B-423366.2   SOSI argues  that the agency’s criticism  mischaracterizes SOSI’s presentation and 
“does not track” the question asked.  Protest  at 24; Comments at  21-22.  We  find that 
the protester’s assertions  are not supported by the record.  
 
In its initial protest filing, the protester  relies on its representative’s  recollection  to assert 
that SOSI’s response to question 3 “addressed . . . cloud- specific security on a public 
cloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for cloud- native security controls --essential 
for implementing Zero Trust in such environments.”   Protest at  24, citing Protest, 
exh. 12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  5.  The  contemporaneous notes  of the agency’s 
evaluators , however, consistently  documented that SOSI’s response to question 3 
“[d]iscussed implementation in a traditional [active directory] forest, not cloud” and “didn’t fully cover cloud env[ironment].”  AR, Tab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation 
Notes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab  60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of 
Evaluator C at  2.  Moreover, while  the protester initially  assert ed that the question “did 
not ask specifically about Azure Entra- ID management ,” Protest at 24, the record shows 
that the question specifically ask ed that the offeror’s proposed solution “[i] ncorporate 
any commercially  available Microsoft Azure and/or Entra ID feature configurations .”  AR, 
Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.   
 After reviewing the agency report (which  included the evaluator s’ notes  and the oral 
presentation questions provided to offerors ), the protester argues  that question 3 “does 
not ask offerors to address this issue from a cloud perspective” because “the word 
‘cloud’ does not even appear in the question.”  Comments at  22.  This new argument, 
however, contradicts  both its prior  declaration recalling that  question 3 was “a 
scenario- based question which related to zero- trust implementation of directory services 
on a public cloud infrastructure”  and its  initial assertion that its presentation “addressed 
. . . cloud- specific security on a public cloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for 
cloud- native security controls .”  Protest at  24; Protest, exh. 12, SOSI Representative 
Decl. at  5 (emphasis added) .  Further, question 3 specifically  asked offerors to 
incorporate “Microsoft Azure and/or Entra ID,” which are a cloud computing platform and a cloud- based access management  service , respectively.  See  
https://azure.microsoft.com/en -us/resources/cloud- computing- dictionary/what -is-azure 
(last visited June 2, 2025); https://learn.microsoft.com/en -us/entra/fundamentals/whatis  
(last visited June 2, 2025) .  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably  assigned 
low to some confidence ratings  for the protester’s response to question 3 for, among 
other things, failing to propose a cloud- based solution as required.  
 In sum, based on our review of the record, including the contemporaneous evaluator notes, we find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation of SOSI’s oral presentation.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.   
 Remaining Challenges  
 SOSI also  challenges  the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s proposal under the 
betterment factor  and argues that the agency unreasonably excluded the proposal from 
the best -value tradeoff analysis.  Protest at  27-30, 35- 38.  The protester also argues  Page 12    B-423366.2   that the agency unreasonably failed to meaningfully investigate and identify  the 
awardee’s OCI.  Id. at 30-33.  As noted above, the solicitation stated that a proposal 
rated low or some confidence for the oral presentation factor would not be considered 
for award.  TOPR at  18.  Because we find that the agency reasonably  excluded the 
protester’s proposal  from further consideration based on the rating of some confidence 
assigned to SOSI’s oral presentation,  we find that  the protester  was not competitively 
prejudiced by any errors with respect to other aspects of the agency’s evaluation of 
SOSI ’s proposal .  In this regard, even if the protester could show that other aspects of 
the evaluation of its proposal were unreasonable, its proposal was properly eliminated from further consideration for award.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where n one is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a 
protest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency’s actions arguably 
were improper.  Zolon PCS, LLC , B-419283, Jan.  14, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  26 at  8; 
VSolvit, LLC, supra.  at 6.   
 SOSI is also not an interested party to challenge the agency’s evaluation of Peraton’s proposal.  In order for a protest to be considered by our Office, a protester must be an interested party, meaning it must have a direct economic interest in the resolut ion of a 
protest issue.  4 C.F.R. § 21.0(a).  A protester is an interested party to challenge the 
evaluation of an awardee’s proposal only where there is a reasonable possibility that the protester’s proposal would be in line for award if the protest were to be sustained.  
Verisys Corp. , B-413204.5 et al., Oct. 2, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  338 at  13.  Where there is 
an acceptable offeror that would be in line for the award ahead of the protester if the protester’s challenge to the award were to be sustained, the protester’s interest is too remote to qualify as an interested party.  SRA Int'l, Inc.; NTT DATA Servs. Fed. Gov't, 
Inc., B-413220.4 et al., May 19, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  173 at  28.  Here, there was another 
technically acceptable offeror whose proposal received the rating of high confidence under each of the first three non- cost/price evaluation factors.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD 
at 35.  This offer or’s proposal would be next in line for award if SOSI’s allegations were 
sustained.  Accordingly, based on our conclusion that the agency reasonably found SOSI’s proposal ineligible for award, we conclude that SOSI is not an interested party to challenge the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s proposal because it would not be in line for contract award were its protest to be sustained.    
 The protest is denied.

The decision issued on the date below was subject to

We dismiss the protest in part and deny it in part.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On October 18, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
section 16.505, DISA issued the RFP to small business holders of DISA ’s ENCORE III 
multiple -award indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   COS/MOL at 1.  
The RFP sought a contractor to provide strategic advisory support  service s.  Id. at 2.  
The RFP contemplated the issuance of a fixed- price task order with a 1- year base 
period and four 1- year option periods.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1a, RFP at 1.
2   
 
The RFP established that award would be made on the basis of a best -value tradeoff, 
considering  two factors, technical/management approach and cost/price, with the 
technical/management approach factor considered to be more important than 
cost/price.  RFP at 7.  The technical/management approach factor consisted of the 
following four subfactors, listed in descending order of importance:  program and project 
planning and execution and risk management  (referred to here as the program and 
project planning subfactor) ; change and configuration management; knowledge 
management division support; and task order management.  Id. at 7-8.   
 
Relevant here, for the program and project planning subfactor, the RFP provided the 
agency would evaluate the offeror ’s “ability to monitor program execution . . .  while 
managing known and unknown program risk .”  RFP at 7.  As also relevant here, for the 
task order management subfactor, DISA would consider  whether the offeror ’s proposal 
included an appropriate mix of labor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours to 
meet the task order requirements.3  Id. at 8.  The RFP provided:  “ As a performance-
based acquisition, offerors are encouraged to review the solicitation to determine the 
most appropriate staffing mix and hours based on their unique approaches to 
performing the work.”  Id.   The solicitation continued:  “It is the responsibility of the 
offeror to propose a technical approach with the appropriate ENCORE III ID/IQ labor categories and number of hours.”  Id.    
 As for the price factor, the RFP stated that price proposals would be evaluated to determine if they we re reasonable and complete, with reasonableness assessed in 
accordance with FAR section 15.404.  RFP at 10.  Additionally, the RFP provided that DISA reserved the right to, but was not obligated to, conduct a realism analysis.  Id.  
 
2 The agency issued four amendments to the RFP.  All citations to the RFP in this 
decision refer to the conformed version of the RFP, submitted as agency report tab 1a.   
3 Similarly, the RFP stated that DISA would evaluate the offeror ’s mix of labor 
categories and hours to assess whether the proposed approach was feasible, low risk, and met or exceeded the agency ’s requirements.  RFP at 9.    Page 3    B-423417  et al.  As also relevant here, the RFP required offerors to state in their proposals whether any 
potential or actual organizational and consultant conflicts  of interest, as described in 
FAR subpart 9.5, existed for the procurement.  RFP at 2.   
 AIX and DSG submitted proposals prior to the November 25, 2024 closing date, and the agency evaluated their  proposals as follows:  
 
 AIX DSG  
Technical/Management  Approach    
Program and Project Planning  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Change and Configuration 
Management  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Knowledge Management Division 
Support  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Task Order Management  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Cost/Price  $107,503,351  $58,807,057  
 Protest, exh. B, Debriefing at 1.   After evaluating the offerors ’ proposals, DISA 
determined that DSG ’s proposal was “slightly technically superior to AIX Tech’s 
proposal and significantly lower priced.”  Id. at 6; see also Protest, exh.  G, Redacted 
Source Selection Decision at  16.  DISA concluded that DSG ’s proposal represented the 
best value, and it issued the task order to DSG.  
 After requesting and receiving a debriefing, AIX filed this protest.

DISCUSSION  
 
AIX protests various aspects of the agency ’s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal under the 
technical/management  approach subfactors  and price, as well as the best -value tradeoff 
decision.5  Additionally, AIX contends that DSG failed to disclose-- and DISA failed to 
assess--a conflict of interest arising out of a personal relationship between an owner of LightGrid ( a joint venture member of DSG) and an agency employee.  For the reasons 
discussed below, we dismiss AIX ’s challenges to DISA ’s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal  
 
4 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $3 5 million.   Accordingly, this 
procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders 
under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of 
the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B) . 
5 In its initial protest, AIX co mplained that DISA abused its discretion by electing not to 
conduct a price realism analysis.  Protest at 16- 17.  Subsequently, the protester 
withdrew the allegation.  Protester ’s Resp. at 8 n.2.    Page 4    B-423417  et al.  and t he best -value tradeoff decision.  We deny the protester ’s remaining protest ground 
concerning the alleged conflict of interest.6 
 
Dismissed Protest Grounds  
 Before turning to the merits of AIX ’s protest, we address the dismissal of various protest 
allegations .  In its initial protest, AIX challenges DISA’ s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal, 
arguing that DISA unreasonably rated DSG ’s proposal as high confidence under the 
technical/management approach subfactors , the evaluation was unequal,  the price 
evaluation was flawed, and DISA did not assess the risks associated with DSG ’s 
proposal  or its understanding of the requirements.  Protest at 19.  AIX also protest s the 
agency ’s best -value tradeoff decision.  Id.  at 19- 22.    
 Before filing the agency report, DISA requested that our Office dismiss these protest 
grounds  as speculative, factually inaccurate, and failing to set forth a legally sufficient 
basis of protest .  Req. for Dismissal at 2.  The agency states :  “Despite AIX ’s Protest 
purportedly alleging numerous evaluation errors on behalf of the Agency, each and every one of AIX ’s unsupported Protest arguments hinges on one fact only, that AIX ’s 
price was 83 [percent]  higher than that of the awardee.”  Id. at 1 (footnote om itted).  
After reviewing the request for dismissal and the protester ’s response, we advised the 
parties that in the agency report, DISA need not respond to the allegations concerning DISA’ s evaluation or  best-value tradeoff decision.  GAO Notice Concerning Req. for 
Partial Dismissal.   We address the dismissal of these protest grounds in the below  
representative examples .   
 
At the outset, we note our Bid Protest Regulations require that a protest include a 
detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. § § 21.1(c)(4), (f).  That is, a protest must include 
sufficient factual bases to establish a reasonable potential that the protester ’s 
allegations may have merit; bare allegations or speculation are insufficient to meet this requirement.  Chags Health Info. Tech., LLC , B-420940.3 et al. , Dec. 14, 2022, 2022

Evaluation of DSG ’s Technical/Management Proposal  
 We first address the protester ’s broad challenges to the agency ’s evaluation of DSG ’s 
proposal under the technical/management approach subfactors.  In its protest, AIX 
alleges that “DSG ’s proposal could not have met all of the RFP requirements at such a 
low price” and asserts that DSG ’s proposal could not have warranted ratings of high 
confidence.  Protest at 10.  AIX notes that the RFP required DISA to assess  whether an 
offeror ’s proposal allowed for continuity of support and included an appropriate mix of  
labor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours , and the protester claims DSG 
could not have met these requirements at the low price proposed.   Id. at 10- 11.  In 
addition, AIX contends that DSG’s low price demonstrates that it does not understand the requirements, or, in the alternative, if DSG’s technical/management proposal 
demonstrated an understanding of the requirements, its price proposal does not align with its technical/management  proposal.  Id.  at 19.      
 DISA requests dismissal, arguing “[t]he entirety of this argument rests i n the fact that 
DSG ’s proposal was lower price d than AIX ’s proposal,” and “AIX provides utterly  no 
allegations concerning the actual contents of DSG ’s proposal and its staffing approach.”  
Req. for Dismissal at 2 -3.  The protester responds that it satisfied our  Office ’s pleading 
standards “by making allegations that if uncontradicted establish the likelihood that [the] 
protest ground [] will prevail.”  Protester ’s Resp. at 4- 5.      
 Here,  AIX’s  allegations are speculative because they are based on an unreasonable 
inference, as opposed to any credible evidence, and such speculative allegations do not 
provide a valid basis of protest .  As noted above, protest allegations based on 
speculation, factual inaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions fail to meet the requirements of our regulations .  Chugach Logistics -Facility Servs., supra; Chags 
Health, supra; Xenith Grp., supra.   AIX’s entire argument rests on a comparison of  
DSG ’s lower price to its own pric e, as well as a comparison of the adjectival ratings 
assigned to each offeror’s proposal .  Based on these comparison s, AIX infers that 
DSG ’s technical proposal could not have met the agency’s requirements.  Protest at 10.  
AIX, however, fails to establish why its own price is the valid benchmark for a technical proposal demonstrating an understanding of the agency’s requirements , or why DSG’s  
technical proposal  is not capable of being rated as high confidence at the price 
proposed.  Instead, AIX offers bald characterizations of DSG’s price as being too low in relation to its own price.  For example, t he protester claims that given “DSG ’s unduly 
low price,” it could not have proposed comparable staff or hours to those proposed by 
AIX.  Id.  at 12.  Again, AIX does not provide any other actual evidence to substantiate 
its claim that DSG price was so low that it could not have proposed qualified staff or a 
sufficient number of labor hours  other than referencing its own price.    
  Page 6    B-423417  et al.  The inference AIX attempts to draw  is particularly problematic in the context of this 
procurement.  As noted above, t he RFP indicated that the procurement was “a 
performance- based acquisition” and encouraged offerors to develop their staffing level 
and approaches  based on “ their unique approaches to performing the work.”   RFP at 8.  
Given that the solicitation contemplated different and unique approaches and solutions, 
it comes as no surprise that two offerors such as AIX and DSG might have different soluti ons and different prices, and that those differences might be significant.  
Accordingly, w e consider  these protest grounds speculative because they require us to 
infer that the agency unreasonably evaluated DSG ’s proposal based entirely on the 
singular fact that DSG’s price  was lower than that proposed by AIX .

Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. --Recon. , B-418916.2 , Sept. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 294 
at 4-5 (denying a request for reconsideration of decision that our Office  dismissed as 
speculative because the protester ’s allegations of unreasonable agency evaluation were 
based on the awardee’ s lower price).  
 Although the protester’s  arguments are styled as challenges to the technical merit of 
DSG’s  proposal , they essentially are arguments that the agency failed to conduct an 
appropriate price realism analysis.  See PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Sector LLP , 
B-415129.3, July  31, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 272 at 3 (argument that agency should have 
found awardee’ s price too low to perform its technical approach is essentially a price 
realism argument) .  Here,  as noted above, the solicitation provided that the agency 
reserved the right to conduct a realism analysis, but it was not obligated to do so.  RFP at 10.   Therefore, this argument fails to  state a legally sufficient basis of protest.  See 
Trademasters Serv., Inc. , B-418522.2 et al. , Apr. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  161 at  6; see 
also NJVC, LLC, B -410035, B -410035.2, Oct. 15, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 307 at 8. 
 Further, absent a provision requiring an agency to undertake a price realism evaluation, 
there is nothing objectionable in an offeror ’s proposal of low, or even below -cost, prices.  
Delta Risk, LLC, B -416420, Aug. 24, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 305 at 19.  A firm, in its 
business judgment, may submit an offer that does not include any profit, or may be below -cost, or may be an attempted buy -in; below -cost pricing is not prohibited.  
Chugach Logistics -Facility Servs., supra at 4 -5.  Without any evidence to support these 
 
7 In a corollary argument, AIX contends that the assignment of ratings of high 
confidence to DSG ’s proposal indicates disparate treatment.  The protester asserts:  
“The Agency must have disparately evaluated DSG and AIX Tech against the evaluation criteria in order to assess the same ratings for the non- price factors.”  Protest 
at 13.  AIX does not claim that the agency unreasonably assessed weaknesses or failed 
to assess strengths  for aspects of its proposal that were substantively indistinguishable 
from, or nearly identical to, those contained in another proposal --as is required to allege 
disparate treatment .  See Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al.  Nov. 13, 2020, 2021 
CPD ¶ 3 at 5.   Instead, AIX asserts that “it is not logical” for  the agency to have 
assigned the proposals identical ratings in light of DSG’s  lower price.  Protest at  14.  
AIX’s specul ative allegation is, again, based on the awardee’s low price and  does not 
identify any factual evidence demonstrating unequal treatment.  I NNOVIM , LLC , 
B-419912, B -419912.2, Sept. 21, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  331 at 6.   Page 7    B-423417  et al.  allegations, we consider the protester ’s arguments to be speculative because it is 
plausible that DSG  proposed to perform this task order  below -cost.  See International 
Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. --Recon. , supra at 4-5. 
 
As a final matter , as an alternative argument, AIX contends that the agency failed to 
consider whether DSG’s technical approach aligned with its price proposal.  Protest at 19 (citing  Earl Indus., LLC , B-309996, B -309996.4, Nov. 5, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 203; 
Information Ventures,  Inc., B-297276.2 et al. , Mar.  1, 2006, 2006 CPD ¶ 45; Honeywell 
Tech. Sols ., Inc.; Wyle Labs., Inc. , B-292354, B -292388, Sept. 2, 2003, 2005 CPD 
¶ 107; TRW, Inc. , B-254045.2, Jan. 10, 1994, 94- 1 CPD ¶ 18 ).  The problem with the 
protester’s argument is that the decisions AIX cites in support of this argument all involve procurements where the agency was required to conduct a cost realism analysis, which requires assessing whether the proposed cost elements  “are consistent 
with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror ’s 
technical proposal. ”  FAR 15.404- 1(d).  Here, however, t he agency was not required to 
conduct a realism analysis for this fixed- price task order, and the protester has not 
identified any language in the RFP that otherwise required such analysis.   Accordingly, 
we consider the argument also legally insufficient.  
 All in all, AIX’s various challenges concerning the agency’s evaluation of DSG’s 
technical/management proposal and understanding of the requirements are dismissed as insufficient and speculative.  
 
Price Evaluation Challenges   
 
We next address AIX ’s challenge to DISA ’s price evaluation.  The protester argues the 
price evaluation was unreasonable because the agency failed to meaningfully compare 
the offerors ’ proposed labor hours and labor categories --as required by the RFP.  
Protest at  13.  The agency counters that the protester ’s arguments conflate the 
evaluation criteria for the task order management subfactor with the evaluation criteria for the price factor .  Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4. 
 As noted above, a protest must include a sufficiently detailed statement of the grounds 
supporting the protest allegations, and the grounds stated must be legally sufficient.   
4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4),  (f).  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency 
action ( e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.   
Eagle Hill Consulting, LLC , B-421938.2, B -421938.3, Dec. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 288 
at 4 (dismissing protest ground as legally insufficient where the protester did not identify 
an evaluation criterion with which the agency failed to comply).  
 Here, the RFP provided that DISA would evaluate price proposals to determine if they 
were reasonable and complete, with reasonableness assessed using the price analysis 
techniques described in FAR section 15.404.  RFP at 10.  The price evaluation criteria did not contemplate a comparison of proposed labor hours and categories.  Rather, as  
the RFP states, such a comparison was required for the task order management 
subfactor.  Id.  at 8-9.  Consequently, AIX’s argument that the price  evaluation was  Page 8    B-423417  et al.  inconsistent with the terms of the solicitation because the agency did not conduct a 
comparative analysis of the offerors ’ proposed labor hours and labor categories  fails to 
state a legally sufficient basis of protest.   The argument is dismissed.   Eagle Hill 
Consulting, supra.  
   
Challenge to Best -Value Tradeoff Decision  
 Finally, we address AIX ’s protest of the best -value tradeoff decision.  The protester 
argues that DISA disregarded the RFP and issued the task order to DSG on a lowest -
price technically acceptable basis.  Protest at 20.   In this regard, the protester maintains 
that its proposal was technically superior  to DSG ’s, and the agency was therefore 
required to consider whether the superiority  warranted a price premium.  Id. at 20-21.   
 We dismiss this allegation.  The only evidence that AIX identifies  in support of the 
allegation that its proposal was technically superior  are its arguments challenging the 
agency ’s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal, which we have dis missed  for the reasons 
discussed above.
8  With no evidence that DISA improperly relied on price in making the 
award decision, the allegation is factually insufficient.  See CAMRIS Int ’l, Inc. , 
B-416561, Aug. 14, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 285 at 5 (dismissing as factually and legally 
insufficient the protester ’s assertion that the agency failed to make a rational best -value 
tradeoff where the allegations were not supported with explanation or documentation) ; 
Endeavor Enter. Sols., LLC , B-407760 et al. , Jan. 31, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 60 at 2 n.2 
(dismiss ing protest of tradeoff where the protester  did not provide any factual support ).  
Indeed, AIX’s complaints are belied by its reliance on documents provided by the agency  with the debriefing,  showing, as noted above, that DISA did consider the 
technical superiority of DSG’s proposal, in addition to its lower price, and found it to be the best value.  Protest, exh. B, Debriefing at  6; see also Protest, exh.  G, Redacted 
Source Selection Decision at  16. 
 In sum, as filed with our Office, several of AIX’s protest grounds fail  to meet the 
standard--as required by our regulations and explained in our decisions --that the 
grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. § § 21.1(c)(4), (f).  Indeed, as noted above, 
where a protester ’s allegations are based on unsupported allegations or speculation, we 
will summarily dismiss a protest without requiring the agency to submit a report ; our bid 
protest procedures do not permit a protester to embark on a fishing expedit ion for 
protest grounds merely because it is dissatisfied with the agency ’s source selection 
decision.   See, e.g., SimVentions, Inc. , supra .  Under these circumstances, and 
consistent with our Office’s practices, these various protest allegations are dismissed.   
4 C.F.R. §  21.5(f). 
 
 
8 As an alternative argument, AIX complains that the tradeoff decision was based on a 
defective evaluation.  Protest at 21.  This allegation is solely based on AIX’s other arguments, which we have dismissed for the reasons stated above, and therefore does not establish an independent valid basis of protest.  Innovative Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. ,

As a final matter , we address AIX’s remaining protest ground.  The protester alleges 
that the procurement was tainted by a conflict of interest, and DSG ’s proposal should 
have been eliminated from the competition because of the conflict.  Supp. Protest at 2.  The protester elaborates  that the chief executive officer and partial owner of LightGrid (a 
joint venture member of DSG ), who we refer to here as Mr. X, is married to a DISA 
contracting officer, who we refer to here as Ms. X, and alleges that this relationship 
created  a conflict of interest.   Id. at 4.  DISA responds that the agency investigated the 
alleged conflict of interest and reasonably determined that no conflict exists.  COS/MOL at 7.     
 Contracting agencies are to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in government procurements.  FAR 3.101- 1; Perspecta Enter. Sols., LLC , B-418533.2, B -418533.3, 
Jun. 17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 213 at 7.  In setting out the standards of conduct that apply to the award of federal contracts, the FAR provides that:  
 
Government business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach and, except as authorized by statute or regulation, with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none.   Transactions relating 
to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust and an impeccable standard of conduct.   The general rule is to avoid 
strictly any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in Government -contractor relationships.

arise in connection with a firm ’s duties to the government through the performance of 
contracts, known as organizational conflicts of interests  under FAR subpart 9.5, and the 
duties of individual contractor personnel in the performance of duties in support of procurement activities, known as personal conflicts of interest  under FAR subpart 3.1.

al., July 25, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  200 at  6.  In this context, we reject  AIX’s contention that  
DSG should have been disqualified because it failed to disclose an actual or potential conflict of interest , as required by the RFP .  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 6- 7 
(quoting RFP at  2).  We note that the RFP provision the protester points to required 
offerors to disclose organizational  and consultant conflicts of interest in accordance with 
FAR subpart 9.5  and does not reference FAR subpart 3.1.  As such, the RFP language 
is inapplicable here.  See  KOAM  Eng’g Sys. , Inc. , B-420157.2, July 6, 2022, 2022 CPD

an agency ’s conflict of interest determination, our Office reviews the reasonableness of 
the determination; where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether a

evidence that the agency ’s conclusion is unreasonable.  See Leidos, Inc. , B-417994,

10 Here, we note that the protester mischaracterizes our decision in Asia Res . Partners  
K.K., B-400552, Nov. 5, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 201, by asserting that a marital relationship 
between the owner of an offeror and a contracting officer  is “simply” enough to create a 
conflict and  provide a basis to exclude the offeror from a procurement.  Supp. Protest 
at 7; Comments & 2nd. Supp. Protest at  12.  In Asia Res . Partners , the agency 
excluded the offeror after finding that the contracting officer had  access to competitively 
useful nonpublic information, and the agency was not aware of the relationship until after the procurement was underway.  Asia Res . Partners , supra at 3-4.  Those facts 
are not present here, as discussed below .  
11 Although the protester repeatedly asserts that the agency ’s investigation of the 
alleged conflict of interest was unreasonable because it occurred after AIX filed its protest (Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 2, 9, 13), our Office has recognized that an 
agency may investigate a possible conflict of interest  after the filing of a bid protest.   
(continued...)   Page 11    B-423417  et al.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at 5.  Specifically, the contracting officer 
requested statements from the technical evaluation team members and the contracting officer ’s representative concerning their communications with Ms. X about the 
solicitation.  Id.   The contracting officer found that the evaluators  and the contracting 
officer ’s representative did not have any communications with Ms. X concerning the 
procurement.  Id.  Similarly, the contracting officer stated that she had not previously 
worked with Ms. X nor had any discussions with Ms. X about this requirement.  Id. at 8.   
 The contracting officer further considered that, as part of an annual financial disclosure process, Ms. X had disclosed her relationship with Mr. X to DISA and been prohibited from participating in matters involving LightGrid without prior authorization.  Consistent with that process, the contracting officer further confirmed that the agency did not  
authoriz e Ms. X to participate in this procurement.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest 
Memorandum at  5.  Additionally, the contracting officer obtained a declarat ion from Ms. 
X in which she stated that she did not have “any involvement of any kind with, the RFP or this procurement effort ,” she had no knowledge of the procurement, and she did not 
share any information concerning the procurement with anyone.  Id. ; AR, Tab  1n, Decl. 
of Ms. X ¶ 7.  She also wrote that she had  not communicated with Mr. X or any 
employee of LightGrid about the procurement.  Id.  ¶ 9.   
 The contracting officer also request ed and received an audit of the agency ’s electronic 
document management system , and that audit indicated that Ms. X had not access ed or 
viewed any documents pertaining to the RFP.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at 5.  In addition, DISA conducted a search of Ms. X ’s emails and 
determined that she did not share any information about the procurement with Mr. X or 
any other LightGrid employees.  Id.  at 6.  After conducting this investigation, the 
contracting officer determined that no conflict of interest existed, and DSG was eligible for award.  Id.  at 9. 
 Although the agency concluded that there was no conflict of interest, AIX complains that the agency ’s investigation was insufficient because the agency narrowly focused on 
whether there was  any unequal access to information on the part of DSG , and the 
“[contracting officer] failed to determine if there was a personal conflict of interest  or if 
there were acts that would affect personal financial interest  associated with award to 
DSG.”  Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest at 2.  We reject this argument because, as 
discussed above, the contracting officer investigated and found that Ms. X had no role in the procurement whatsoever.  See generally  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest 
Memorandum.   
 Ms. X was not involved in drafting the solicitation documents, she was not involved in the evaluation, she did not communicate with the DISA personnel responsible for those functions, and she did not access any of the documents for the procurement.  Id. at 5-6;

contracting officer found M s. X was not involved in the instant procurement , did not 
have access to associated procurement materials , and therefore could not have 
provided the awardee with any possible advantage.   We find no basis to question the 
contracting officer’s investigation.  The protester has not established that the 
relationship between Mr. and Ms. X r esulted in favoritism toward DSG in this 
procurement . 
 In our view, the facts here do not establish any impropriety requiring the exclusion of the 
awardee, or otherwise reflect that the alleged conflict existed and prejudiced the protester .  KOAM  Eng’g Sys. , supra at 8.  We find no support for the protester ’s 
allegation that the procurement was tainted by a conflict of interest , and we deny this

 1.  Protest  arguments  challenging various aspects of the agency ’s evaluation of the 
awardee ’s proposal and best -value tradeoff decision are dismissed as legally 
insufficient where the protest grounds are insufficient and rely on speculative allegations 
concerning the awardee’ s proposed price.  
 2.  Protest alleging that the agency failed to adequately assess and address an alleged conflict of interest is denied where the agency meaningfully considered the allegation and reasonably concluded that no conflict of interest existed.

The decision issued on the date below was subject to

 BACKGROUND  
 On October 18, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
section 16.505, DISA issued the RFP to small business holders of DISA ’s ENCORE III 
multiple -award indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   COS/MOL at 1.  
The RFP sought a contractor to provide strategic advisory support  service s.  Id. at 2.  
The RFP contemplated the issuance of a fixed- price task order with a 1- year base 
period and four 1- year option periods.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1a, RFP at 1.
2   
 
The RFP established that award would be made on the basis of a best -value tradeoff, 
considering  two factors, technical/management approach and cost/price, with the 
technical/management approach factor considered to be more important than 
cost/price.  RFP at 7.  The technical/management approach factor consisted of the 
following four subfactors, listed in descending order of importance:  program and project 
planning and execution and risk management  (referred to here as the program and 
project planning subfactor) ; change and configuration management; knowledge 
management division support; and task order management.  Id. at 7-8.   
 
Relevant here, for the program and project planning subfactor, the RFP provided the 
agency would evaluate the offeror ’s “ability to monitor program execution . . .  while 
managing known and unknown program risk .”  RFP at 7.  As also relevant here, for the 
task order management subfactor, DISA would consider  whether the offeror ’s proposal 
included an appropriate mix of labor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours to 
meet the task order requirements.3  Id. at 8.  The RFP provided:  “ As a performance-
based acquisition, offerors are encouraged to review the solicitation to determine the 
most appropriate staffing mix and hours based on their unique approaches to 
performing the work.”  Id.   The solicitation continued:  “It is the responsibility of the 
offeror to propose a technical approach with the appropriate ENCORE III ID/IQ labor categories and number of hours.”  Id.    
 As for the price factor, the RFP stated that price proposals would be evaluated to determine if they we re reasonable and complete, with reasonableness assessed in 
accordance with FAR section 15.404.  RFP at 10.  Additionally, the RFP provided that DISA reserved the right to, but was not obligated to, conduct a realism analysis.  Id.  
 
2 The agency issued four amendments to the RFP.  All citations to the RFP in this 
decision refer to the conformed version of the RFP, submitted as agency report tab 1a.   
3 Similarly, the RFP stated that DISA would evaluate the offeror ’s mix of labor 
categories and hours to assess whether the proposed approach was feasible, low risk, and met or exceeded the agency ’s requirements.  RFP at 9.    Page 3    B-423417  et al.  As also relevant here, the RFP required offerors to state in their proposals whether any 
potential or actual organizational and consultant conflicts  of interest, as described in 
FAR subpart 9.5, existed for the procurement.  RFP at 2.   
 AIX and DSG submitted proposals prior to the November 25, 2024 closing date, and the agency evaluated their  proposals as follows:  
 
 AIX DSG  
Technical/Management  Approach    
Program and Project Planning  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Change and Configuration 
Management  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Knowledge Management Division 
Support  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Task Order Management  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Cost/Price  $107,503,351  $58,807,057  
 Protest, exh. B, Debriefing at 1.   After evaluating the offerors ’ proposals, DISA 
determined that DSG ’s proposal was “slightly technically superior to AIX Tech’s 
proposal and significantly lower priced.”  Id. at 6; see also Protest, exh.  G, Redacted 
Source Selection Decision at  16.  DISA concluded that DSG ’s proposal represented the 
best value, and it issued the task order to DSG.  
 After requesting and receiving a debriefing, AIX filed this protest.

DISCUSSION  
 
AIX protests various aspects of the agency ’s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal under the 
technical/management  approach subfactors  and price, as well as the best -value tradeoff 
decision.5  Additionally, AIX contends that DSG failed to disclose-- and DISA failed to 
assess--a conflict of interest arising out of a personal relationship between an owner of LightGrid ( a joint venture member of DSG) and an agency employee.  For the reasons 
discussed below, we dismiss AIX ’s challenges to DISA ’s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal  
 
4 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $3 5 million.   Accordingly, this 
procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders 
under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of 
the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B) . 
5 In its initial protest, AIX co mplained that DISA abused its discretion by electing not to 
conduct a price realism analysis.  Protest at 16- 17.  Subsequently, the protester 
withdrew the allegation.  Protester ’s Resp. at 8 n.2.    Page 4    B-423417  et al.  and t he best -value tradeoff decision.  We deny the protester ’s remaining protest ground 
concerning the alleged conflict of interest.6 
 
Dismissed Protest Grounds  
 Before turning to the merits of AIX ’s protest, we address the dismissal of various protest 
allegations .  In its initial protest, AIX challenges DISA’ s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal, 
arguing that DISA unreasonably rated DSG ’s proposal as high confidence under the 
technical/management approach subfactors , the evaluation was unequal,  the price 
evaluation was flawed, and DISA did not assess the risks associated with DSG ’s 
proposal  or its understanding of the requirements.  Protest at 19.  AIX also protest s the 
agency ’s best -value tradeoff decision.  Id.  at 19- 22.    
 Before filing the agency report, DISA requested that our Office dismiss these protest 
grounds  as speculative, factually inaccurate, and failing to set forth a legally sufficient 
basis of protest .  Req. for Dismissal at 2.  The agency states :  “Despite AIX ’s Protest 
purportedly alleging numerous evaluation errors on behalf of the Agency, each and every one of AIX ’s unsupported Protest arguments hinges on one fact only, that AIX ’s 
price was 83 [percent]  higher than that of the awardee.”  Id. at 1 (footnote om itted).  
After reviewing the request for dismissal and the protester ’s response, we advised the 
parties that in the agency report, DISA need not respond to the allegations concerning DISA’ s evaluation or  best-value tradeoff decision.  GAO Notice Concerning Req. for 
Partial Dismissal.   We address the dismissal of these protest grounds in the below  
representative examples .   
 
At the outset, we note our Bid Protest Regulations require that a protest include a 
detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. § § 21.1(c)(4), (f).  That is, a protest must include 
sufficient factual bases to establish a reasonable potential that the protester ’s 
allegations may have merit; bare allegations or speculation are insufficient to meet this requirement.  Chags Health Info. Tech., LLC , B-420940.3 et al. , Dec. 14, 2022, 2022

Evaluation of DSG ’s Technical/Management Proposal  
 We first address the protester ’s broad challenges to the agency ’s evaluation of DSG ’s 
proposal under the technical/management approach subfactors.  In its protest, AIX 
alleges that “DSG ’s proposal could not have met all of the RFP requirements at such a 
low price” and asserts that DSG ’s proposal could not have warranted ratings of high 
confidence.  Protest at 10.  AIX notes that the RFP required DISA to assess  whether an 
offeror ’s proposal allowed for continuity of support and included an appropriate mix of  
labor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours , and the protester claims DSG 
could not have met these requirements at the low price proposed.   Id. at 10- 11.  In 
addition, AIX contends that DSG’s low price demonstrates that it does not understand the requirements, or, in the alternative, if DSG’s technical/management proposal 
demonstrated an understanding of the requirements, its price proposal does not align with its technical/management  proposal.  Id.  at 19.      
 DISA requests dismissal, arguing “[t]he entirety of this argument rests i n the fact that 
DSG ’s proposal was lower price d than AIX ’s proposal,” and “AIX provides utterly  no 
allegations concerning the actual contents of DSG ’s proposal and its staffing approach.”  
Req. for Dismissal at 2 -3.  The protester responds that it satisfied our  Office ’s pleading 
standards “by making allegations that if uncontradicted establish the likelihood that [the] 
protest ground [] will prevail.”  Protester ’s Resp. at 4- 5.      
 Here,  AIX’s  allegations are speculative because they are based on an unreasonable 
inference, as opposed to any credible evidence, and such speculative allegations do not 
provide a valid basis of protest .  As noted above, protest allegations based on 
speculation, factual inaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions fail to meet the requirements of our regulations .  Chugach Logistics -Facility Servs., supra; Chags 
Health, supra; Xenith Grp., supra.   AIX’s entire argument rests on a comparison of  
DSG ’s lower price to its own pric e, as well as a comparison of the adjectival ratings 
assigned to each offeror’s proposal .  Based on these comparison s, AIX infers that 
DSG ’s technical proposal could not have met the agency’s requirements.  Protest at 10.  
AIX, however, fails to establish why its own price is the valid benchmark for a technical proposal demonstrating an understanding of the agency’s requirements , or why DSG’s  
technical proposal  is not capable of being rated as high confidence at the price 
proposed.  Instead, AIX offers bald characterizations of DSG’s price as being too low in relation to its own price.  For example, t he protester claims that given “DSG ’s unduly 
low price,” it could not have proposed comparable staff or hours to those proposed by 
AIX.  Id.  at 12.  Again, AIX does not provide any other actual evidence to substantiate 
its claim that DSG price was so low that it could not have proposed qualified staff or a 
sufficient number of labor hours  other than referencing its own price.    
  Page 6    B-423417  et al.  The inference AIX attempts to draw  is particularly problematic in the context of this 
procurement.  As noted above, t he RFP indicated that the procurement was “a 
performance- based acquisition” and encouraged offerors to develop their staffing level 
and approaches  based on “ their unique approaches to performing the work.”   RFP at 8.  
Given that the solicitation contemplated different and unique approaches and solutions, 
it comes as no surprise that two offerors such as AIX and DSG might have different soluti ons and different prices, and that those differences might be significant.  
Accordingly, w e consider  these protest grounds speculative because they require us to 
infer that the agency unreasonably evaluated DSG ’s proposal based entirely on the 
singular fact that DSG’s price  was lower than that proposed by AIX .

Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. --Recon. , B-418916.2 , Sept. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 294 
at 4-5 (denying a request for reconsideration of decision that our Office  dismissed as 
speculative because the protester ’s allegations of unreasonable agency evaluation were 
based on the awardee’ s lower price).  
 Although the protester’s  arguments are styled as challenges to the technical merit of 
DSG’s  proposal , they essentially are arguments that the agency failed to conduct an 
appropriate price realism analysis.  See PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Sector LLP , 
B-415129.3, July  31, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 272 at 3 (argument that agency should have 
found awardee’ s price too low to perform its technical approach is essentially a price 
realism argument) .  Here,  as noted above, the solicitation provided that the agency 
reserved the right to conduct a realism analysis, but it was not obligated to do so.  RFP at 10.   Therefore, this argument fails to  state a legally sufficient basis of protest.  See 
Trademasters Serv., Inc. , B-418522.2 et al. , Apr. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  161 at  6; see 
also NJVC, LLC, B -410035, B -410035.2, Oct. 15, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 307 at 8. 
 Further, absent a provision requiring an agency to undertake a price realism evaluation, 
there is nothing objectionable in an offeror ’s proposal of low, or even below -cost, prices.  
Delta Risk, LLC, B -416420, Aug. 24, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 305 at 19.  A firm, in its

Chugach Logistics -Facility Servs., supra at 4 -5.  Without any evidence to support these 
 
7 In a corollary argument, AIX contends that the assignment of ratings of high 
confidence to DSG ’s proposal indicates disparate treatment.  The protester asserts:  
“The Agency must have disparately evaluated DSG and AIX Tech against the evaluation criteria in order to assess the same ratings for the non- price factors.”  Protest 
at 13.  AIX does not claim that the agency unreasonably assessed weaknesses or failed 
to assess strengths  for aspects of its proposal that were substantively indistinguishable 
from, or nearly identical to, those contained in another proposal --as is required to allege 
disparate treatment .  See Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al.  Nov. 13, 2020, 2021 
CPD ¶ 3 at 5.   Instead, AIX asserts that “it is not logical” for  the agency to have 
assigned the proposals identical ratings in light of DSG’s  lower price.  Protest at  14.  
AIX’s specul ative allegation is, again, based on the awardee’s low price and  does not 
identify any factual evidence demonstrating unequal treatment.  I NNOVIM , LLC ,

plausible that DSG  proposed to perform this task order  below -cost.  See International 
Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. --Recon. , supra at 4-5. 
 
As a final matter , as an alternative argument, AIX contends that the agency failed to 
consider whether DSG’s technical approach aligned with its price proposal.  Protest at 19 (citing  Earl Indus., LLC , B-309996, B -309996.4, Nov. 5, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 203; 
Information Ventures,  Inc., B-297276.2 et al. , Mar.  1, 2006, 2006 CPD ¶ 45; Honeywell

¶ 107; TRW, Inc. , B-254045.2, Jan. 10, 1994, 94- 1 CPD ¶ 18 ).  The problem with the 
protester’s argument is that the decisions AIX cites in support of this argument all involve procurements where the agency was required to conduct a cost realism analysis, which requires assessing whether the proposed cost elements  “are consistent 
with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror ’s 
technical proposal. ”  FAR 15.404- 1(d).  Here, however, t he agency was not required to 
conduct a realism analysis for this fixed- price task order, and the protester has not 
identified any language in the RFP that otherwise required such analysis.   Accordingly, 
we consider the argument also legally insufficient.  
 All in all, AIX’s various challenges concerning the agency’s evaluation of DSG’s 
technical/management proposal and understanding of the requirements are dismissed as insufficient and speculative.  
 
Price Evaluation Challenges   
 
We next address AIX ’s challenge to DISA ’s price evaluation.  The protester argues the 
price evaluation was unreasonable because the agency failed to meaningfully compare 
the offerors ’ proposed labor hours and labor categories --as required by the RFP.  
Protest at  13.  The agency counters that the protester ’s arguments conflate the 
evaluation criteria for the task order management subfactor with the evaluation criteria for the price factor .  Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4. 
 As noted above, a protest must include a sufficiently detailed statement of the grounds 
supporting the protest allegations, and the grounds stated must be legally sufficient.   
4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4),  (f).  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency 
action ( e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.   
Eagle Hill Consulting, LLC , B-421938.2, B -421938.3, Dec. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 288 
at 4 (dismissing protest ground as legally insufficient where the protester did not identify 
an evaluation criterion with which the agency failed to comply).  
 Here, the RFP provided that DISA would evaluate price proposals to determine if they 
were reasonable and complete, with reasonableness assessed using the price analysis 
techniques described in FAR section 15.404.  RFP at 10.  The price evaluation criteria did not contemplate a comparison of proposed labor hours and categories.  Rather, as  
the RFP states, such a comparison was required for the task order management 
subfactor.  Id.  at 8-9.  Consequently, AIX’s argument that the price  evaluation was  Page 8    B-423417  et al.  inconsistent with the terms of the solicitation because the agency did not conduct a 
comparative analysis of the offerors ’ proposed labor hours and labor categories  fails to 
state a legally sufficient basis of protest.   The argument is dismissed.   Eagle Hill 
Consulting, supra.  
   
Challenge to Best -Value Tradeoff Decision  
 Finally, we address AIX ’s protest of the best -value tradeoff decision.  The protester 
argues that DISA disregarded the RFP and issued the task order to DSG on a lowest -
price technically acceptable basis.  Protest at 20.   In this regard, the protester maintains 
that its proposal was technically superior  to DSG ’s, and the agency was therefore 
required to consider whether the superiority  warranted a price premium.  Id. at 20-21.   
 We dismiss this allegation.  The only evidence that AIX identifies  in support of the 
allegation that its proposal was technically superior  are its arguments challenging the 
agency ’s evaluation of DSG ’s proposal, which we have dis missed  for the reasons 
discussed above.
8  With no evidence that DISA improperly relied on price in making the 
award decision, the allegation is factually insufficient.  See CAMRIS Int ’l, Inc. , 
B-416561, Aug. 14, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 285 at 5 (dismissing as factually and legally 
insufficient the protester ’s assertion that the agency failed to make a rational best -value 
tradeoff where the allegations were not supported with explanation or documentation) ;

(dismiss ing protest of tradeoff where the protester  did not provide any factual support ).  
Indeed, AIX’s complaints are belied by its reliance on documents provided by the agency  with the debriefing,  showing, as noted above, that DISA did consider the 
technical superiority of DSG’s proposal, in addition to its lower price, and found it to be the best value.  Protest, exh. B, Debriefing at  6; see also Protest, exh.  G, Redacted 
Source Selection Decision at  16. 
 In sum, as filed with our Office, several of AIX’s protest grounds fail  to meet the 
standard--as required by our regulations and explained in our decisions --that the 
grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. § § 21.1(c)(4), (f).  Indeed, as noted above, 
where a protester ’s allegations are based on unsupported allegations or speculation, we 
will summarily dismiss a protest without requiring the agency to submit a report ; our bid 
protest procedures do not permit a protester to embark on a fishing expedit ion for 
protest grounds merely because it is dissatisfied with the agency ’s source selection 
decision.   See, e.g., SimVentions, Inc. , supra .  Under these circumstances, and 
consistent with our Office’s practices, these various protest allegations are dismissed.   
4 C.F.R. §  21.5(f). 
 
 
8 As an alternative argument, AIX complains that the tradeoff decision was based on a 
defective evaluation.  Protest at 21.  This allegation is solely based on AIX’s other arguments, which we have dismissed for the reasons stated above, and therefore does not establish an independent valid basis of protest.  Innovative Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. ,

As a final matter , we address AIX’s remaining protest ground.  The protester alleges 
that the procurement was tainted by a conflict of interest, and DSG ’s proposal should 
have been eliminated from the competition because of the conflict.  Supp. Protest at 2.  The protester elaborates  that the chief executive officer and partial owner of LightGrid (a 
joint venture member of DSG ), who we refer to here as Mr. X, is married to a DISA 
contracting officer, who we refer to here as Ms. X, and alleges that this relationship 
created  a conflict of interest.   Id. at 4.  DISA responds that the agency investigated the 
alleged conflict of interest and reasonably determined that no conflict exists.  COS/MOL at 7.

K.K., B-400552, Nov. 5, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 201, by asserting that a marital relationship 
between the owner of an offeror and a contracting officer  is “simply” enough to create a 
conflict and  provide a basis to exclude the offeror from a procurement.  Supp. Protest 
at 7; Comments & 2nd. Supp. Protest at  12.  In Asia Res . Partners , the agency 
excluded the offeror after finding that the contracting officer had  access to competitively 
useful nonpublic information, and the agency was not aware of the relationship until after the procurement was underway.  Asia Res . Partners , supra at 3-4.  Those facts 
are not present here, as discussed below .  
11 Although the protester repeatedly asserts that the agency ’s investigation of the 
alleged conflict of interest was unreasonable because it occurred after AIX filed its protest (Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 2, 9, 13), our Office has recognized that an 
agency may investigate a possible conflict of interest  after the filing of a bid protest.   
(continued...)   Page 11    B-423417  et al.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at 5.  Specifically, the contracting officer 
requested statements from the technical evaluation team members and the contracting officer ’s representative concerning their communications with Ms. X about the 
solicitation.  Id.   The contracting officer found that the evaluators  and the contracting 
officer ’s representative did not have any communications with Ms. X concerning the 
procurement.  Id.  Similarly, the contracting officer stated that she had not previously 
worked with Ms. X nor had any discussions with Ms. X about this requirement.  Id. at 8.   
 The contracting officer further considered that, as part of an annual financial disclosure process, Ms. X had disclosed her relationship with Mr. X to DISA and been prohibited from participating in matters involving LightGrid without prior authorization.  Consistent with that process, the contracting officer further confirmed that the agency did not  
authoriz e Ms. X to participate in this procurement.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest 
Memorandum at  5.  Additionally, the contracting officer obtained a declarat ion from Ms. 
X in which she stated that she did not have “any involvement of any kind with, the RFP or this procurement effort ,” she had no knowledge of the procurement, and she did not 
share any information concerning the procurement with anyone.  Id. ; AR, Tab  1n, Decl. 
of Ms. X ¶ 7.  She also wrote that she had  not communicated with Mr. X or any 
employee of LightGrid about the procurement.  Id.  ¶ 9.   
 The contracting officer also request ed and received an audit of the agency ’s electronic 
document management system , and that audit indicated that Ms. X had not access ed or 
viewed any documents pertaining to the RFP.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at 5.  In addition, DISA conducted a search of Ms. X ’s emails and 
determined that she did not share any information about the procurement with Mr. X or 
any other LightGrid employees.  Id.  at 6.  After conducting this investigation, the 
contracting officer determined that no conflict of interest existed, and DSG was eligible for award.  Id.  at 9. 
 Although the agency concluded that there was no conflict of interest, AIX complains that the agency ’s investigation was insufficient because the agency narrowly focused on 
whether there was  any unequal access to information on the part of DSG , and the 
“[contracting officer] failed to determine if there was a personal conflict of interest  or if 
there were acts that would affect personal financial interest  associated with award to 
DSG.”  Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest at 2.  We reject this argument because, as 
discussed above, the contracting officer investigated and found that Ms. X had no role in the procurement whatsoever.  See generally  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest 
Memorandum.   
 Ms. X was not involved in drafting the solicitation documents, she was not involved in the evaluation, she did not communicate with the DISA personnel responsible for those functions, and she did not access any of the documents for the procurement.  Id. at 5-6; 
 
See, e.g., Pioneer Corp. Servs. , Inc. , B-418678.5, Aug. 31, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 312 at 5

located in a different state from Ms. X and is assigned to a different branch of the agency.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at  8; Supp. MOL at  4.  In sum, the 
contracting officer found M s. X was not involved in the instant procurement , did not 
have access to associated procurement materials , and therefore could not have 
provided the awardee with any possible advantage.   We find no basis to question the 
contracting officer’s investigation.  The protester has not established that the 
relationship between Mr. and Ms. X r esulted in favoritism toward DSG in this 
procurement . 
 In our view, the facts here do not establish any impropriety requiring the exclusion of the 
awardee, or otherwise reflect that the alleged conflict existed and prejudiced the protester .  KOAM  Eng’g Sys. , supra at 8.  We find no support for the protester ’s 
allegation that the procurement was tainted by a conflict of interest , and we deny this 
protest ground.
  
 The protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.

DECISION  
 CueBid Technologies, Inc., doing business as CueBid BioDefense, a small business of Edinburg, Texas,  protests the Department of the Army’s decision to cancel , rather than 
amend, request for quotations (RFQ)  No. W9115125Q0005 for equipment washdown 
services.  CueBid also protests the establishment of several  blanket purchase 
agreements  (BPA) and the issuance of a call order for equipment sanitization services 
under the BPA issued  to Titan Associates Group, Inc., of Athens, Tennessee.  The  Page 2 B-423161.7  protester further  asserts that the Army failed to stay performance of the equipment 
washdown services , as required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) in 
response to its earlier protest  of the terms of solicitation No. W9115125Q0005.  The 
protester also contends that the agency’s issuance of the call order to Titan violated the 
stay of performance put in place by the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (OHA)  in response to CueBid’s  North American Industry 
Classifica tion System (NAICS) code challenge to that office.  
 
We dismiss  the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 When a unit deploys overseas, the Army must wash its equipment to remove debris and hazardous material from all surfaces before disinfecting the equipment to specific agricultural sanitation and disinfection customs standards.  Req. for Dismissal at 2.   On 
November 4, 2024, in preparation for a December 2024 deployment, the Army  issued 
RFQ No. W9115125Q0005,  with the intent to award one fixed- price contract for  
operational washdown services for Army equipment.
1  Protest, exh. 3, RFQ amend. 
00001 at 1; Req. for Dismissal at 3 .  The closing date for receipt of quotations was 
November 8, and the period of performance was November 12- 15.  Id.   
 On November  6, CueBid protested the terms of  the solicitation  with our Office , assert ing 
that the RFQ  requirements were  ambiguous  and violate d procurement law and 
regulation.   See Protest, exh. 11, Initial Protest.  On November 13 , CueBid challenged  
the NAICS code assigned to the solicitation with SBA’s OHA.  Protest, exh. 8, CueBid 
NAICS Appeal; see also exh. 10, OHA Order at 1 n.1 (noting that the after -hours filing 
on November 12 was counted as having been filed on November 13).  On 
November  15--one week after the November 8 closing date for receipt of quotations --
OHA ordered a stay of the closing date of receipt of quotations  pending the resolution of 
the NAICS code challenge.  Protest, exh. 10, OHA Order at 2.   
 Rather than amend the RFQ, the Army used troop labor to accomplish the washdown services.  Req. for Dismissal at 3.  On November 15, after Army personnel had 
completed washing the machinery, the Army issued a call order for sanitation services 
to Titan under an existing BPA.
2  Req. For Dismissal, exh. 1, BPA Call Order at 1.  That 
 
1 The parties briefed at length differing views on whether the RFQ included only 
washing services or both washing and sanitizing services.  Compare Protest at 9 (“[t]he 
initial solicitation required washing and sanitizing 276 pieces of equipment”) with Req. 
for Dismissal at 2 (stating that “request for quotations no. W91151- 25-Q-0005” was for 
“operational washdown services ”).  We need not consider this issue because it has no 
relevance to our resolution of the protest.  
 
2 On June 16, 2023, the Army established three BPAs ( Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001, -2002, 
and -2003)  with economically disadvantaged women- owned businesses, including 
Titan.  Reply to Objection at 7.   BPA No. W91248- 23-A-2001 was issued to Titan.   Page 3 B-423161.7  same day, the Army posted notice of the issuance of a  call order to Titan on FPDS .gov--
the Federal Procurement Data System .  See Protest, exh. 13, Notice of Award of BPA 
Call Order .  On November 21, the Army requested dismissal of CueBid’s protest 
because the agency had used troop labor to perform the washing requirement  and was 
cancelling the solicitation.  Req. for Dismissal, exh. 2, Req. to Dismiss Initial Protest 
at 1.  On November 25, this Office dismissed th e protest .  See CueBid Technologies, 
Inc. d/ b/a CueBid BioDefense, B -423161 et al., Nov. 25, 2024 (unpublished decision).3   
 
On February 19,  2025, CueBid learned of the issuance of the call order to Titan for the 
sanitation services .  Protest at 2.  CueBid filed this protest March 3,  asserting various 
violations of procurement law and regulation.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
CueBid  alleg es that the agency unreasonably canceled-- and failed to amend--the RFQ  
and that  the agency’s establishment of the three BPAs  was improper .  We dismiss 
those allegations as untimely.  We dismiss as failing to state a valid basis of protest the 
allegation that the issuance of a call order to satisfy this  requirement was outside the 
scope of the of the BPA .  CueBid argues that the issuance of the call  order to Titan was 
improper ; the protester is not an interested party to bring that  challenge, and we dismiss 
it on that basis.  Finally, CueBid alleges that the agency improperly failed to leave in 
place the stay s of performance required under CICA and by OHA.   We dismis s the 
allegation related to the CICA stay as not for GAO’s consideration and dismiss the allegation regarding the OHA stay as failing to state a valid basis of protest.

Timeliness of Challenges to the Cancelation of the Solicitation  
 
The Army argues that any challenges to the agency’s decision not to amend the RFQ --
and to cancel it instead--are untimely.  Reply to Objection at 12- 13, citing  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(2)  (a protest must generally be filed no later than 10 days after the protester 
 
 
3 CueBid request ed reconsideration of that dismissal, asserting that the agency had 
only stated its intent to cancel the RFQ, but had not yet canceled it .  See  CueBid 
BioDefense--Recon. , B-423161.6, Dec. 30, 2024 (unpublished decision)  at 1.  The 
protester also assert ed that the individual who signed the memorandum stating that the 
Army would cancel the solicitation lacked the authority to cancel the RFQ .  See id . at 2.  
GAO found no legal or factual error that would warrant reconsideration of our decision 
dismissing the protest, and we denied the protester’s request that we reconsider that decision.  Id.  at 3. 
 
4 Over the course of record development, CueBid produced approximately 120 exhibits 
to support a myriad of allegations concerning improper agency conduct .  While we do 
not address each allegation, we have considered ever y protest ground and find none 
provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  
  Page 4 B-423161.7  knew or should have known the basis of protest).  The agency notes that it posted 
notice of the cancelation to SAM.gov on November 26, 2024.5  Req. for Dismissal, 
exh. 7, Notice of Cancelation.  The Army  contends that CueBid thus knew on 
November  26 the basis for its protest, namely, that instead of amending the solicitation 
the agency had canceled it.  CueBid did not respond to the agency’s argument  that 
these allegations are untimely.  See Resp. to Agency Reply (not addressing any issues 
of timeliness) .  Because CueBid did not protest the Army’s November 26, 2024, 
cancelation of the RFQ until March  3, 2025, we agree with the Army that the allegations 
related to the cancelation are untimely  and dismiss them .6  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2) . 
 
Allegations Regarding the Establishment of the BPAs  
 
CueBid asserts various challenges to the establishment of BPA s with Titan and two 
other firms .  The Army contends these  allegations are likewise untimely.  Reply to 
Objection at 16, citing  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).   The record includes CueBid’s search of 
FPDS, using “ W9124823A2001” as the search term.  Protest, exh. 12a, FP DS Award 
Records, Feb. 18, 2025.  That identifier --W9124823A2001--is the number of the BPA 
the Army issued Titan.  Protest, exh. 12a, FPDS Award Records, Feb. 18, 2025,  at 1.  It 
is thus clear from the record that CueBid  knew of the establishment of the BPA with 
Titan no later than February  18.  Any challenge to the establishment of the BPA w as 
timely only if filed within 10 days of February 18, or February 28.  Because CueBid’s 
challenges  were filed on March 3, we agree with the agency that these allegations are 
also untimely, and we dismiss them.

CPD ¶ 133 at 2 n.1.  
 
6 We also note that the Army’s rationale for canceling the RFQ in lieu of amending it 
was that there was insufficient time to amend the RFQ and then wash, sanitize, inspect, 
transport, and load for shipment 276 pieces of equipment in time for the planned deployment.  Reply to Objection at 9- 10.  We have previously found a similar rationale 
for canceling a solicitation reasonable.  Henry's Aerial Serv., Inc.; Evergreen Flying Servs., Inc ., B-414238.7, B -414238.9, Aug.  10, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  257 at 8  (denying 
protest of an agency ’s cancellation of a solicitation in response to a prior protest where 
the agency had insufficient time to conduct a reevaluation of proposals before its time-sensitive requirements changed and where another procurement vehicle was available to fulfill its needs).    Page 5 B-423161.7  Allegation that Requirement Being Satisfied Was Out of Scope of BPA  
 
CueBid asserts that, in issuing call order No. W9115125F0010 to Titan, the Army 
unreasonably used a BPA intended for use by the XVIII Airborne Corps to support a requirement of the III  Armored Corps, thus exceeding the scope of the procurement 
vehicle.  Protest at 15.  T he Army explains , however,  that the agency amended the 
BPAs to add III Armored Corps as an additional location.  Reply to Objection at 7, citing  
Req. for Dismissal, exh. 5, BPA amend. P0001 at 5 (noting that “[t]he purpose of this modification is to add III Corps locations and include a list of authorized users”).  The protester does not dispute these facts.  See  Resp. to Agency Reply.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. § 21.1(c)(4) and (f), require that a protest include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  These requirements contemplate that protes ters 
will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  As noted above, the Army amended the BPA to specifically inc lude support for 
the III Armored Corps.  As such, the protester relies upon an incorrect fact (the BPA does not authorize support for the III Armored Corps) to support its allegation.  Because the protester’s allegation contains a material factual error, we dismiss th is allegation for 
failure to state a valid basis of protest.     
 Allegations Regarding the Issuance of the Call Order to Titan 
 CueBid asserts other various violations of procurement law and regulation regarding the 
issuance of the call order No. W9115125F0010 for sanitation work to Titan, including, 
for instance,  that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis .  
Protest at 11 .  As discussed below, we di smiss the allegation on the basis the protester 
is not an interested party to bring it .   
 Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. §§ 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a), provide that only an “interested party, ” that is, an actual offeror or quoter whose direct economic interest 
would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract, may file a protest.   Where a firm would not be in line for the award of a contract (or in this 
instance, the establishment of a BPA  or the issuance of task orders) even if its protest 
were sustained, the firm is not an interested party within the meaning of our Bid Protest Regulations.  Foxhole Tech., LLC , B-420718, July 29, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  203 at 3.  
 Here, the agency limited the competition for the call order to holders of the BPA.  See  
Reply to Objection, exh. 1, decl. of Contracting Officer  at 2 (noting that the agency “sent 
RFQs to holders of BPA Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001 P1, - 2002 P1, and - 2003 P1 for the 
sanitation and disinfection of the washed equipment”).  CueBid is not one of the three 
firms that hold the requisite BPA  and was therefore not included in the competition for 
the BPA call order that the Army issued to Titan.  As a  non-participant, CueB id had no 
direct economic interest that was affected by the evaluation error CueBid alleges because it would not have been in line for award even if its allegation was sustained.   Page 6 B-423161.7  Consequently, we dismiss  its argument that the agency failed to perform a proper price 
reasonableness analysis before issuing the call order to Titan on the basis that CueBid 
is not an interested party to bring that  allegation.7  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a).  
 
Challenges to the Army’s Conduct Regarding the CICA and OHA Stays  
 
CueBid contends that the agency overrode the CICA stay of performance of the RFQ 
without following proper protocol and that issuance of the call  order  to Titan violated the 
OHA stay.   Protest at 5, 7 (“Contract Award in Violation of SBA OHA Stay Order ”).  The 
protester argues that “[t]he mandatory stay mechanism is intended to prevent contract 
execution that would moot a protest or undermine fair competition.”  Protest at  8. 
 
Under certain circumstances, a protest to this Office triggers what is known as a CICA 
stay of performance.  31 U .S.C. § 3553(c)(1).  Unless the head of a procuring activity 
waives compliance with the required stay, the agency may not award a contract in a procurement after the federal agency “has received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.”  Id .  
Section 3553(c)(1) only prohibits the agency from awarding a contract resulting from the protested procurement.  AeroSage LLC , B-410648.2, B -410648.3, Mar. 20, 2015, 2015 
CPD ¶ 111 at 3.  That regulation does not prohibit the agency from satisfying the same 
or related requirements  included in the procurement through other means.  Id.      
 It is well settled that an agency’s failure to comply with the statutory CICA stay 
requirement is not a valid basis of protest  to our Office .  4 C.F.R. § 21.6 (“GAO does not 
administer the requirements to withhold award or suspend contract performance.”); 
AeroSage, LLC , B-418292 et al., Feb. 27, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  77 at  11 (an agency’s 
alleged failure to comply with the requirement to withhold award fails to state a valid 
basis of protest); AeroSage,  LLC; SageCare, Inc. , B-415267.13, B -415267.14, Mar. 19, 
2018, 2018 CPD ¶  114 at 5 (same).   The allegation that the Army improperly 
circumvented the CICA stay of  performance of  the RFQ requirement, while it has no 
support  in the record, is not for GAO’s consideration, and we dismiss it.
8  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.6; AeroSage, LLC , supra.     
 
 
7 The protester complains of a lack of notice in establishing the underlying BPAs, 
asserting that an “invitation only vehicle”  circumvents the full and open competition 
requirement of CICA.  Protest at 16.  Again, challenges to the establishment of the BPAs are untimely.  
8 Moreover, as noted above, an agency may not award a contract in a procurement 
after the federal agency “has received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.”  31 U .S.C. 
§ 3553(c)(1).  The stay , absent an agreement among the parties,  has no relevance to 
the protested procurement once the protest is no longer pending, and it is not  relevant 
to any other procurement.  See id . 
  Page 7 B-423161.7  CueBid  also alleges the Army’s issuance of the BPA call order  to Titan “disregard[ed]  
the OHA [s] tay.”  Protest at 7.  A n agency’s failure to suspend performance is a 
procedural defect that does not affect the validity of an award and therefore does not 
provide a basis to sustain a protest.  Mission Analytics, LLC , B-422841.3, Dec. 11,

DECISION  
 CueBid Technologies, Inc., doing business as CueBid BioDefense, a small business of Edinburg, Texas,  protests the Department of the Army’s decision to cancel , rather than 
amend, request for quotations (RFQ)  No. W9115125Q0005 for equipment washdown 
services.  CueBid also protests the establishment of several  blanket purchase 
agreements  (BPA) and the issuance of a call order for equipment sanitization services 
under the BPA issued  to Titan Associates Group, Inc., of Athens, Tennessee.  The  Page 2 B-423161.7  protester further  asserts that the Army failed to stay performance of the equipment 
washdown services , as required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) in 
response to its earlier protest  of the terms of solicitation No. W9115125Q0005.  The

for Dismissal at 2 (stating that “request for quotations no. W91151- 25-Q-0005” was for 
“operational washdown services ”).  We need not consider this issue because it has no 
relevance to our resolution of the protest.

and -2003)  with economically disadvantaged women- owned businesses, including 
Titan.  Reply to Objection at 7.   BPA No. W91248- 23-A-2001 was issued to Titan.   Page 3 B-423161.7  same day, the Army posted notice of the issuance of a  call order to Titan on FPDS .gov--
the Federal Procurement Data System .  See Protest, exh. 13, Notice of Award of BPA 
Call Order .  On November 21, the Army requested dismissal of CueBid’s protest 
because the agency had used troop labor to perform the washing requirement  and was 
cancelling the solicitation.  Req. for Dismissal, exh. 2, Req. to Dismiss Initial Protest 
at 1.  On November 25, this Office dismissed th e protest .  See CueBid Technologies, 
Inc. d/ b/a CueBid BioDefense, B -423161 et al., Nov. 25, 2024 (unpublished decision).3   
 
On February 19,  2025, CueBid learned of the issuance of the call order to Titan for the 
sanitation services .  Protest at 2.  CueBid filed this protest March 3,  asserting various 
violations of procurement law and regulation.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
CueBid  alleg es that the agency unreasonably canceled-- and failed to amend--the RFQ  
and that  the agency’s establishment of the three BPAs  was improper .  We dismiss 
those allegations as untimely.  We dismiss as failing to state a valid basis of protest the 
allegation that the issuance of a call order to satisfy this  requirement was outside the 
scope of the of the BPA .  CueBid argues that the issuance of the call  order to Titan was 
improper ; the protester is not an interested party to bring that  challenge, and we dismiss 
it on that basis.  Finally, CueBid alleges that the agency improperly failed to leave in 
place the stay s of performance required under CICA and by OHA.   We dismis s the 
allegation related to the CICA stay as not for GAO’s consideration and dismiss the allegation regarding the OHA stay as failing to state a valid basis of protest.

Timeliness of Challenges to the Cancelation of the Solicitation  
 
The Army argues that any challenges to the agency’s decision not to amend the RFQ --
and to cancel it instead--are untimely.  Reply to Objection at 12- 13, citing  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(2)  (a protest must generally be filed no later than 10 days after the protester 
 
 
3 CueBid request ed reconsideration of that dismissal, asserting that the agency had 
only stated its intent to cancel the RFQ, but had not yet canceled it .  See  CueBid 
BioDefense--Recon. , B-423161.6, Dec. 30, 2024 (unpublished decision)  at 1.  The 
protester also assert ed that the individual who signed the memorandum stating that the 
Army would cancel the solicitation lacked the authority to cancel the RFQ .  See id . at 2.  
GAO found no legal or factual error that would warrant reconsideration of our decision 
dismissing the protest, and we denied the protester’s request that we reconsider that decision.  Id.  at 3. 
 
4 Over the course of record development, CueBid produced approximately 120 exhibits 
to support a myriad of allegations concerning improper agency conduct .  While we do 
not address each allegation, we have considered ever y protest ground and find none 
provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  
  Page 4 B-423161.7  knew or should have known the basis of protest).  The agency notes that it posted 
notice of the cancelation to SAM.gov on November 26, 2024.5  Req. for Dismissal, 
exh. 7, Notice of Cancelation.  The Army  contends that CueBid thus knew on 
November  26 the basis for its protest, namely, that instead of amending the solicitation 
the agency had canceled it.  CueBid did not respond to the agency’s argument  that 
these allegations are untimely.  See Resp. to Agency Reply (not addressing any issues 
of timeliness) .  Because CueBid did not protest the Army’s November 26, 2024, 
cancelation of the RFQ until March  3, 2025, we agree with the Army that the allegations 
related to the cancelation are untimely  and dismiss them .6  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2) . 
 
Allegations Regarding the Establishment of the BPAs  
 
CueBid asserts various challenges to the establishment of BPA s with Titan and two 
other firms .  The Army contends these  allegations are likewise untimely.  Reply to 
Objection at 16, citing  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).   The record includes CueBid’s search of 
FPDS, using “ W9124823A2001” as the search term.  Protest, exh. 12a, FP DS Award 
Records, Feb. 18, 2025.  That identifier --W9124823A2001--is the number of the BPA 
the Army issued Titan.  Protest, exh. 12a, FPDS Award Records, Feb. 18, 2025,  at 1.  It 
is thus clear from the record that CueBid  knew of the establishment of the BPA with 
Titan no later than February  18.  Any challenge to the establishment of the BPA w as 
timely only if filed within 10 days of February 18, or February 28.  Because CueBid’s 
challenges  were filed on March 3, we agree with the agency that these allegations are 
also untimely, and we dismiss them.

6 We also note that the Army’s rationale for canceling the RFQ in lieu of amending it 
was that there was insufficient time to amend the RFQ and then wash, sanitize, inspect, 
transport, and load for shipment 276 pieces of equipment in time for the planned deployment.  Reply to Objection at 9- 10.  We have previously found a similar rationale 
for canceling a solicitation reasonable.  Henry's Aerial Serv., Inc.; Evergreen Flying Servs., Inc ., B-414238.7, B -414238.9, Aug.  10, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  257 at 8  (denying 
protest of an agency ’s cancellation of a solicitation in response to a prior protest where 
the agency had insufficient time to conduct a reevaluation of proposals before its time-sensitive requirements changed and where another procurement vehicle was available to fulfill its needs).    Page 5 B-423161.7  Allegation that Requirement Being Satisfied Was Out of Scope of BPA  
 
CueBid asserts that, in issuing call order No. W9115125F0010 to Titan, the Army 
unreasonably used a BPA intended for use by the XVIII Airborne Corps to support a requirement of the III  Armored Corps, thus exceeding the scope of the procurement 
vehicle.  Protest at 15.  T he Army explains , however,  that the agency amended the 
BPAs to add III Armored Corps as an additional location.  Reply to Objection at 7, citing  
Req. for Dismissal, exh. 5, BPA amend. P0001 at 5 (noting that “[t]he purpose of this modification is to add III Corps locations and include a list of authorized users”).  The protester does not dispute these facts.  See  Resp. to Agency Reply.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. § 21.1(c)(4) and (f), require that a protest include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  These requirements contemplate that protes ters 
will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  As noted above, the Army amended the BPA to specifically inc lude support for 
the III Armored Corps.  As such, the protester relies upon an incorrect fact (the BPA does not authorize support for the III Armored Corps) to support its allegation.  Because the protester’s allegation contains a material factual error, we dismiss th is allegation for 
failure to state a valid basis of protest.     
 Allegations Regarding the Issuance of the Call Order to Titan 
 CueBid asserts other various violations of procurement law and regulation regarding the 
issuance of the call order No. W9115125F0010 for sanitation work to Titan, including, 
for instance,  that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis .  
Protest at 11 .  As discussed below, we di smiss the allegation on the basis the protester 
is not an interested party to bring it .   
 Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. §§ 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a), provide that only an “interested party, ” that is, an actual offeror or quoter whose direct economic interest 
would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract, may file a protest.   Where a firm would not be in line for the award of a contract (or in this 
instance, the establishment of a BPA  or the issuance of task orders) even if its protest 
were sustained, the firm is not an interested party within the meaning of our Bid Protest Regulations.  Foxhole Tech., LLC , B-420718, July 29, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  203 at 3.  
 Here, the agency limited the competition for the call order to holders of the BPA.  See  
Reply to Objection, exh. 1, decl. of Contracting Officer  at 2 (noting that the agency “sent 
RFQs to holders of BPA Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001 P1, - 2002 P1, and - 2003 P1 for the 
sanitation and disinfection of the washed equipment”).  CueBid is not one of the three 
firms that hold the requisite BPA  and was therefore not included in the competition for 
the BPA call order that the Army issued to Titan.  As a  non-participant, CueB id had no 
direct economic interest that was affected by the evaluation error CueBid alleges because it would not have been in line for award even if its allegation was sustained.   Page 6 B-423161.7  Consequently, we dismiss  its argument that the agency failed to perform a proper price 
reasonableness analysis before issuing the call order to Titan on the basis that CueBid 
is not an interested party to bring that  allegation.7  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a).  
 
Challenges to the Army’s Conduct Regarding the CICA and OHA Stays  
 
CueBid contends that the agency overrode the CICA stay of performance of the RFQ 
without following proper protocol and that issuance of the call  order  to Titan violated the 
OHA stay.   Protest at 5, 7 (“Contract Award in Violation of SBA OHA Stay Order ”).  The 
protester argues that “[t]he mandatory stay mechanism is intended to prevent contract 
execution that would moot a protest or undermine fair competition.”  Protest at  8. 
 
Under certain circumstances, a protest to this Office triggers what is known as a CICA 
stay of performance.  31 U .S.C. § 3553(c)(1).  Unless the head of a procuring activity 
waives compliance with the required stay, the agency may not award a contract in a procurement after the federal agency “has received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.”  Id .  
Section 3553(c)(1) only prohibits the agency from awarding a contract resulting from the protested procurement.  AeroSage LLC , B-410648.2, B -410648.3, Mar. 20, 2015, 2015 
CPD ¶ 111 at 3.  That regulation does not prohibit the agency from satisfying the same 
or related requirements  included in the procurement through other means.  Id.      
 It is well settled that an agency’s failure to comply with the statutory CICA stay 
requirement is not a valid basis of protest  to our Office .  4 C.F.R. § 21.6 (“GAO does not 
administer the requirements to withhold award or suspend contract performance.”); 
AeroSage, LLC , B-418292 et al., Feb. 27, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  77 at  11 (an agency’s 
alleged failure to comply with the requirement to withhold award fails to state a valid 
basis of protest); AeroSage,  LLC; SageCare, Inc. , B-415267.13, B -415267.14, Mar. 19, 
2018, 2018 CPD ¶  114 at 5 (same).   The allegation that the Army improperly 
circumvented the CICA stay of  performance of  the RFQ requirement, while it has no 
support  in the record, is not for GAO’s consideration, and we dismiss it.
8  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.6; AeroSage, LLC , supra.     
 
 
7 The protester complains of a lack of notice in establishing the underlying BPAs, 
asserting that an “invitation only vehicle”  circumvents the full and open competition 
requirement of CICA.  Protest at 16.  Again, challenges to the establishment of the BPAs are untimely.  
8 Moreover, as noted above, an agency may not award a contract in a procurement 
after the federal agency “has received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.”  31 U .S.C. 
§ 3553(c)(1).  The stay , absent an agreement among the parties,  has no relevance to 
the protested procurement once the protest is no longer pending, and it is not  relevant 
to any other procurement.  See id . 
  Page 7 B-423161.7  CueBid  also alleges the Army’s issuance of the BPA call order  to Titan “disregard[ed]  
the OHA [s] tay.”  Protest at 7.  A n agency’s failure to suspend performance is a 
procedural defect that does not affect the validity of an award and therefore does not 
provide a basis to sustain a protest.  Mission Analytics, LLC , B-422841.3, Dec. 11,

of protest.  4 C.F.R. §  21.1(c)(4), (f).

DECISION  
 Scott Investigations & Research, LLC, of Omaha, Nebraska, protests the rejection of its  
proposal submitted in response to request for proposals (RFP) No. SPE3S1- 24-R- 0011, 
issued by the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), for water 
drinking pouches.  Scott asserts that the solicitation was unnecessarily restrictive, and 
that the agency failed to provide it with meaningful discussions.    We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation for emergency water pouches on September 13, 2024, as a small business set -aside.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 1.  On  Page 2 B-423342  October 22 , the agency issued amendment 4 to the solicitation,  which changed the 
solicitation from a small business set -aside, to allow for full and open competition.  AR, 
Tab 5, RF P, amend. 4.  The closing date for the receipt of proposals was extended to 
November 12.  Id.  
 
The solicitation provided for the award of an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity 
contract to the offeror that submitted the low est-priced, technically acceptable proposal.   
With respect to the technical evaluation,  offerors were required to submit a product 
demonstration model (PDM).  AR, Tab 2, RFP, amend. 1 at 11.  Id.   The PDMs were to 
be evaluated based on organoleptic qualities such as taste, color, texture, appearance, and overall quality as well as compliance with specifications, including a requirement for a center spout on the water pouch and sterilization requirements.  Id. at 11, 13.  
Offerors were also required to submit a business proposal for evaluation with a food 
defense plan, an integrated pest program, and a quality system plan.  Id.  at 11 -12.  For 
price, offerors were required to provide prices for five tiers , each representing a 1 -year 
period of performance.  RFP at 5.   Eight offerors, including Scott, submitted proposals in response to the solicitation.  Contracting Officer’s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 5.  Scott 
submitted a business proposal, but did not submit a PDM.  Id.  at 5.  Because Scott 
failed to submit a PDM, Scott’s proposal was not evaluated and was given a rating of “Reject .”  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter s at 1.  Subsequently, the agency 
opened discussions , and on December 18 sent Scott  the following notice : 
 
Pursuant to [Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR)] 15.307(b), this is the 
government ’s formal written notification that discussions are opened . . . .   
Your firm is afforded the opportunity to address these areas of concern identified by the government.  In addition . . .  Scott Investigations & 
Research, LLC, may submit any revision, clarification, explanation, or additional information . . . that it may wish to provide at this time.  If your 
firm does not respond to this notice by the specified date and time, your offer will be evaluated based upon its original submission.  
    
* * * * * 
 Technical /PDM:  
 
PDM evaluation was not conducted. . . .  Scott Investigations & Research, 
LLC did not submit signed amendment or PDMs prior to the time set for 
closing of offers.   Scott Investigations & Research, LLC is given a rating of 
“Reject” as this PDM was not received at DLA Troop Support or DEVCOM 
SC. 
 
* * * * * 
 
  Page 3 B-423342   
Failure to address the above aspects of your proposal correctly and completely could lead to your company’s proposal being considered technically unacceptable, and therefore not evaluated further for purposes of the award.  
 
* * * * * 
 Submission of any proposal revisions must be received by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time, on or before January 7, 2025 to be considered.   
 Id. at 1-2.   
 Scott submitted its final proposal revision which included a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable.  COS/MOL at 6; AR, Tab 16, PDM Eval. at 1.  The agency determined that the offered water pouch was unacceptable because it did not have a center spout, and the water  had a plastic chemical flavor.  Id.  On 
February 20, the agency awarded the contract to Ameri Qual Packaging.  AR, 
Tab 20, Contract.  Scott was provided a debriefing on February 21 and submitted this protest to our Office the same day.   
 DISCUSSION  Scott protests that the solicitation was restrictive of competition, and that the 
agency failed to engage in meaningful discussions.  As discussed below, Scott’s 
protest is without merit.
1 
 
Solicitation Challenges  
 Scott protests that the sterilization requirements are restrictive of competition because, according to Scott, only Ameri Qual can comply with them.  Scott also 
protests that the evaluation of the PDMs was improperly based on subjective 
organoleptic qualities  such as taste, instead of the purity of the drinking water.  
 These bases of protest are untimely.  Under our Bid Protest Regulations, a protest challenging an impropriety apparent from the face of the solicitation must be filed prior to the closing date for the receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. 21.2(a)( 1).  
Here, the sterilization requirements and the fact that the evaluation would be based on organoleptic factors were evident from the solicitation as issued,  and 
the closing date for the receipt of proposals was November 12, 2024.  Since 
 
1 Scott has raised numerous corollary arguments.  We have considered each of them 
and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  Our decision discusses the 
primary issues  raised by Scott .    Page 4 B-423342  Scott did not first raise these issues until its February 21, 2025,  protest with our 
Office, they are untimely  and are dismissed.   
 
Meaningful Discussions  
 Scott also protests that the agency failed to hold meaningful discussions.  Scott 
asserts that the agency never  indicated that negotiations were completed or 
allowed Scott to submit a final proposal revision.  Scott states that after 
submitting its proposal revision on January 7, it conducted further research and was ready to continue negotiations.  The protester  complains that it wanted the 
opportunity to submit a second PDM  that would meet the solicitation 
requirements .  Scott notes that the solicitation provided that if an offeror 
submitted a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable, and negotiations were held, the offeror would be permitted to submit a second PDM.  The protester asserts that negotiations  were held and Scott’s PDM was evaluated as 
unacceptable so in accordance with the solicitation the agency was required to permit Scott to submit a second PDM.  
 The agency disputes Scott’s allegations.  The agency asserts that it informed Scott  of the deficiencies in its initial proposal, including Scott’s failure to provide a 
PDM, and provided Scott with the opportunity to correct those deficiencies.  COS/MOL  at 10.  The agency also notes that it provided all offerors a common 
cut-off date to submit final proposal revisions, and did not indicate that further 
discussions should be anticipated.  Id.  The agency further asserts that since 
Scott failed to provide a PD M with its initial proposal, after the PDM that Scott 
submitted with its final proposal revision was evaluated as unacceptable, the 
agency was not required to allow Scott to submit a second PDM.  Id. at 13.   
 On this record, w e find that the agency held meaningful discussions with Scott.   
Discussions, when conducted, must identify proposal deficiencies and significant weaknesses that could be addr essed to materially enhance the offeror ’s potential 
for receiving award.   Serco Inc. , B-405280, Oct. 12, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 237 at 1 1.  
However, agencies are not required to reopen discussions to afford an offeror an 
additional opportunity to revise its proposal where a weakness or deficiency is first introduced in the firm ’s revised proposal.   MetalCraft Marine, Inc.,  B-410199,  
B-410199.2, Nov. 13, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 338 at 10;  Raytheon Co. , B-403110.3, 
Apr. 26, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 96 at 7.    
 Scott ’s initial proposal  was evaluated as unacceptable because Scott did not 
provide, among other things, the required PDM.  The agency opened discussions and advised Scott that it was required to submit a PDM and  provided Scott the 
opportunity to submit a revised proposal , including a PDM,  that complied with the 
solicitation requirements.  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter at 1.  The 
agency therefore advised Scott of the deficiency in its proposal and provided Scott the opportunity to correct it, thus meeting its obligation to hold meaningful discussions.  When Scott submitted a PDM with its final proposal revision that  Page 5 B-423342  was evaluated as unacceptable, the agency was not required to reopen 
discussions to allow Scott the opportunity to correct the deficiency --the 
unacceptable PDM --that was introduced in its revised proposal.  See MetalCraft 
Marine, Inc. , supra;  Raytheon Co. , supra.2    
 
As noted above, Scott also complains that the agency failed to notify Scott that 
negotiations were completed or allow Scott to submit a final proposal revision.  Scott 
states that after submitting its proposal revisions  on January 7, it conducted further 
research and was ready to continue negotiations.   
 
The discussions notice sent to Scott referenced FAR section 15.307(b), which 
addresses  proposal revisions , and requires that at the conclusion of discussions each 
offeror still in the competitive range be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal 
revision; the contracting officer is required to establish a common cut -off date for the 
receipt of final proposal  revisions.  Further, requests for final proposal revisions must 
advise offerors that the final proposal revisions shall be in writing and that t he 
government intends to make award without obtaining further revisions.  
 Here, the discussions notice provi ded that proposal revisions must be submitted by 3:00 
PM on January 7.  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter s at 2.  The notice further 
stated that if Scott did not respond to the notice by the specified date and time its offer would be evaluated based on its original submission.  Id.  at 1.  Finally, the notice stated 
that failure to address the noted aspects of its proposal correctly and completely could lead to the proposal being considered technically unacceptable,  and not further 
evaluated for award.  Id. at 2.  In addition, all offerors were provided the same date and 
time to submit proposal revisions.   See id. at 1 -16.   
 Accordingly, the record shows that the agency provided  a common cut -off date for  all 
offerors to submit a formal proposal revision.  COS/MOL  at 5-6.  Moreover, while Scott 
believed the negotiations would be ongoing, as noted, the letter specifically stated that i f 
Scott did not respond to the request for a proposal revision its proposal would be evaluated based on its original submission.  This should have put Scott on notice that 
the agency intended to make an award without obtaining further revisions.  Given thes e 
factors we find that the agency’s conduct of negotiations was reasonable and consistent 
with the FAR.  See OMNIPLEX World Servs. Corp. , B-406251, B -406251.2, March 14,  
  
 
 
2 Scott asserts that the solicitation permitted offerors to submit a second PDM if 
the agency held additional negotiations.  To be clear, Scott did not submit a PDM 
with its initial proposal and the agency permitted Scott to submit a revised 
proposal with a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable.  The agency did not hold further negotiations after it received Scott’s revised proposal with its PDM and evaluated it as unacceptable.  The agency was not required to provide Scott with a second opportunity to submit an acceptable PDM.   Page 6 B-423342  2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 113 at 5. (language giving notice to all offerors of a common cut -off 
date for receipt of offers has the intent and effect of a request for final proposal 
revisions ). 
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 Scott Investigations & Research, LLC, of Omaha, Nebraska, protests the rejection of its  
proposal submitted in response to request for proposals (RFP) No. SPE3S1- 24-R- 0011, 
issued by the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), for water 
drinking pouches.  Scott asserts that the solicitation was unnecessarily restrictive, and 
that the agency failed to provide it with meaningful discussions.    We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation for emergency water pouches on September 13, 2024, as a small business set -aside.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 1.  On  Page 2 B-423342  October 22 , the agency issued amendment 4 to the solicitation,  which changed the 
solicitation from a small business set -aside, to allow for full and open competition.  AR, 
Tab 5, RF P, amend. 4.  The closing date for the receipt of proposals was extended to 
November 12.  Id.  
 
The solicitation provided for the award of an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity 
contract to the offeror that submitted the low est-priced, technically acceptable proposal.   
With respect to the technical evaluation,  offerors were required to submit a product 
demonstration model (PDM).  AR, Tab 2, RFP, amend. 1 at 11.  Id.   The PDMs were to 
be evaluated based on organoleptic qualities such as taste, color, texture, appearance, and overall quality as well as compliance with specifications, including a requirement for a center spout on the water pouch and sterilization requirements.  Id. at 11, 13.  
Offerors were also required to submit a business proposal for evaluation with a food 
defense plan, an integrated pest program, and a quality system plan.  Id.  at 11 -12.  For 
price, offerors were required to provide prices for five tiers , each representing a 1 -year 
period of performance.  RFP at 5.   Eight offerors, including Scott, submitted proposals in response to the solicitation.  Contracting Officer’s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 5.  Scott 
submitted a business proposal, but did not submit a PDM.  Id.  at 5.  Because Scott 
failed to submit a PDM, Scott’s proposal was not evaluated and was given a rating of “Reject .”  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter s at 1.  Subsequently, the agency 
opened discussions , and on December 18 sent Scott  the following notice : 
 
Pursuant to [Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR)] 15.307(b), this is the 
government ’s formal written notification that discussions are opened . . . .   
Your firm is afforded the opportunity to address these areas of concern identified by the government.  In addition . . .  Scott Investigations & 
Research, LLC, may submit any revision, clarification, explanation, or additional information . . . that it may wish to provide at this time.  If your 
firm does not respond to this notice by the specified date and time, your offer will be evaluated based upon its original submission.  
    
* * * * * 
 Technical /PDM:  
 
PDM evaluation was not conducted. . . .  Scott Investigations & Research, 
LLC did not submit signed amendment or PDMs prior to the time set for 
closing of offers.   Scott Investigations & Research, LLC is given a rating of 
“Reject” as this PDM was not received at DLA Troop Support or DEVCOM 
SC.

 Submission of any proposal revisions must be received by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time, on or before January 7, 2025 to be considered.   
 Id. at 1-2.   
 Scott submitted its final proposal revision which included a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable.  COS/MOL at 6; AR, Tab 16, PDM Eval. at 1.  The agency determined that the offered water pouch was unacceptable because it did not have a center spout, and the water  had a plastic chemical flavor.  Id.  On 
February 20, the agency awarded the contract to Ameri Qual Packaging.  AR, 
Tab 20, Contract.  Scott was provided a debriefing on February 21 and submitted this protest to our Office the same day.   
 DISCUSSION  Scott protests that the solicitation was restrictive of competition, and that the 
agency failed to engage in meaningful discussions.  As discussed below, Scott’s 
protest is without merit.
1 
 
Solicitation Challenges  
 Scott protests that the sterilization requirements are restrictive of competition because, according to Scott, only Ameri Qual can comply with them.  Scott also 
protests that the evaluation of the PDMs was improperly based on subjective 
organoleptic qualities  such as taste, instead of the purity of the drinking water.  
 These bases of protest are untimely.  Under our Bid Protest Regulations, a protest challenging an impropriety apparent from the face of the solicitation must be filed prior to the closing date for the receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. 21.2(a)( 1).  
Here, the sterilization requirements and the fact that the evaluation would be based on organoleptic factors were evident from the solicitation as issued,  and 
the closing date for the receipt of proposals was November 12, 2024.  Since 
 
1 Scott has raised numerous corollary arguments.  We have considered each of them 
and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  Our decision discusses the 
primary issues  raised by Scott .    Page 4 B-423342  Scott did not first raise these issues until its February 21, 2025,  protest with our 
Office, they are untimely  and are dismissed.   
 
Meaningful Discussions  
 Scott also protests that the agency failed to hold meaningful discussions.  Scott 
asserts that the agency never  indicated that negotiations were completed or 
allowed Scott to submit a final proposal revision.  Scott states that after 
submitting its proposal revision on January 7, it conducted further research and was ready to continue negotiations.  The protester  complains that it wanted the 
opportunity to submit a second PDM  that would meet the solicitation 
requirements .  Scott notes that the solicitation provided that if an offeror 
submitted a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable, and negotiations were held, the offeror would be permitted to submit a second PDM.  The protester asserts that negotiations  were held and Scott’s PDM was evaluated as 
unacceptable so in accordance with the solicitation the agency was required to permit Scott to submit a second PDM.  
 The agency disputes Scott’s allegations.  The agency asserts that it informed Scott  of the deficiencies in its initial proposal, including Scott’s failure to provide a 
PDM, and provided Scott with the opportunity to correct those deficiencies.  COS/MOL  at 10.  The agency also notes that it provided all offerors a common 
cut-off date to submit final proposal revisions, and did not indicate that further 
discussions should be anticipated.  Id.  The agency further asserts that since 
Scott failed to provide a PD M with its initial proposal, after the PDM that Scott 
submitted with its final proposal revision was evaluated as unacceptable, the 
agency was not required to allow Scott to submit a second PDM.  Id. at 13.   
 On this record, w e find that the agency held meaningful discussions with Scott.   
Discussions, when conducted, must identify proposal deficiencies and significant weaknesses that could be addr essed to materially enhance the offeror ’s potential 
for receiving award.   Serco Inc. , B-405280, Oct. 12, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 237 at 1 1.  
However, agencies are not required to reopen discussions to afford an offeror an 
additional opportunity to revise its proposal where a weakness or deficiency is first introduced in the firm ’s revised proposal.   MetalCraft Marine, Inc.,  B-410199,  
B-410199.2, Nov. 13, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 338 at 10;  Raytheon Co. , B-403110.3, 
Apr. 26, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 96 at 7.    
 Scott ’s initial proposal  was evaluated as unacceptable because Scott did not 
provide, among other things, the required PDM.  The agency opened discussions and advised Scott that it was required to submit a PDM and  provided Scott the 
opportunity to submit a revised proposal , including a PDM,  that complied with the 
solicitation requirements.  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter at 1.  The 
agency therefore advised Scott of the deficiency in its proposal and provided Scott the opportunity to correct it, thus meeting its obligation to hold meaningful discussions.  When Scott submitted a PDM with its final proposal revision that  Page 5 B-423342  was evaluated as unacceptable, the agency was not required to reopen 
discussions to allow Scott the opportunity to correct the deficiency --the 
unacceptable PDM --that was introduced in its revised proposal.  See MetalCraft 
Marine, Inc. , supra;  Raytheon Co. , supra.2    
 
As noted above, Scott also complains that the agency failed to notify Scott that 
negotiations were completed or allow Scott to submit a final proposal revision.  Scott 
states that after submitting its proposal revisions  on January 7, it conducted further 
research and was ready to continue negotiations.   
 
The discussions notice sent to Scott referenced FAR section 15.307(b), which 
addresses  proposal revisions , and requires that at the conclusion of discussions each 
offeror still in the competitive range be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal 
revision; the contracting officer is required to establish a common cut -off date for the 
receipt of final proposal  revisions.  Further, requests for final proposal revisions must 
advise offerors that the final proposal revisions shall be in writing and that t he 
government intends to make award without obtaining further revisions.  
 Here, the discussions notice provi ded that proposal revisions must be submitted by 3:00 
PM on January 7.  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter s at 2.  The notice further 
stated that if Scott did not respond to the notice by the specified date and time its offer would be evaluated based on its original submission.  Id.  at 1.  Finally, the notice stated 
that failure to address the noted aspects of its proposal correctly and completely could lead to the proposal being considered technically unacceptable,  and not further 
evaluated for award.  Id. at 2.  In addition, all offerors were provided the same date and 
time to submit proposal revisions.   See id. at 1 -16.   
 Accordingly, the record shows that the agency provided  a common cut -off date for  all 
offerors to submit a formal proposal revision.  COS/MOL  at 5-6.  Moreover, while Scott 
believed the negotiations would be ongoing, as noted, the letter specifically stated that i f 
Scott did not respond to the request for a proposal revision its proposal would be evaluated based on its original submission.  This should have put Scott on notice that 
the agency intended to make an award without obtaining further revisions.  Given thes e 
factors we find that the agency’s conduct of negotiations was reasonable and consistent 
with the FAR.  See OMNIPLEX World Servs. Corp. , B-406251, B -406251.2, March 14,  
  
 
 
2 Scott asserts that the solicitation permitted offerors to submit a second PDM if 
the agency held additional negotiations.  To be clear, Scott did not submit a PDM 
with its initial proposal and the agency permitted Scott to submit a revised 
proposal with a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable.  The agency did not hold further negotiations after it received Scott’s revised proposal with its PDM and evaluated it as unacceptable.  The agency was not required to provide Scott with a second opportunity to submit an acceptable PDM.   Page 6 B-423342  2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 113 at 5. (language giving notice to all offerors of a common cut -off 
date for receipt of offers has the intent and effect of a request for final proposal 
revisions ). 
 The protest is denied.

B-423366,"June 11, 2025","DirectViz Solutions, LLC","1.  Protest that awardee has disqualifying organizational conflicts of interest is sustained where the record shows that the agency unreasonably concluded there was no possibility of a potential conflict arising from the awardee’s performance of a related task order.

DECISION  
 DirectViz Solutions, LLC, of Vienna, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) 
No. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information 
technology support services for the Army’s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester 
challenges various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of proposals and award decision, including the agency’s evaluation of Peraton’s organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs).  
 We sustain the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423366 et al.  BACKGROUND  
 
The Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army’s GCC.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 7; Agency  Report (AR), 
Tab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.
1  The 
solicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army’s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services (CHESS- ITESS) multiple -award, 
indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation 
anticipated issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort task order with a 1-
month phase- in period, an 11- month base period of performance, three 1 -year option 
periods, and one additional 6- month option.  Id.  at 2. 
 The task order’s scope of work encompassed “operations and maintenance [] functions, as well as integration of emerging and directed technology adoption” for the Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM), as well as “common service support, capability management support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  
As relevant here, GCC was previously known as the Regional Cyber Center -Continental 
United States (RCC- CONUS), one of five Regional Cyber Cent ers (RCCs) under 
NETCOM.
2  Protest at 1-2; COS/MOL at  3-4.  The solicitation advised that “[t] here is a 
possibility that this follow- on requirement for GCC will not exercise all of the options and 
will merge into a separate competed acquisition for a global, consolidated contract/task order for support across all [ RCCs ].”  TOPR at 1.  In this regard, the solicitation further 
specified that “potential, anticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning [RCC- CONUS] from a[n] RCC to a [GCC] that helps support better 
coordination of digital oper ations across the world.”  TOPR at  1.  The agency states that 
the purpose of the task order is to build a new GCC that will “ultimately replace and 
subsume the work of the standalone RCCs.”   COS/MOL at  3. 
 The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; 
(4) betterment; and (5) cost/price.  TOPR at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost/price 
factors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost/price factors, taken 
together, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation 
of the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign 
 
1 The solicitation was amended four times.  Unless otherwise noted, citations to the 
solicitation are to the final amended version of the TOPR provided in tab 25 of the 
agency report.  Citations to agency report documents are to the internal page numbers marked in the documents; for documents without consecutive page numbers, we cite to 
the Adobe PDF page numbers.  
2 DirectViz was the incumbent contractor for the predecessor task order for 
cybersecurity information technology support services at the RCC -CONUS.   Page 3 B-423366 et al.  confidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the 
agency’s level of confidence that the offeror “ understands the requirement, proposes a 
sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .”  Id.  at 20.  The 
solicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence for any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. 
 The solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 3, 6-18.  Under phase I, 
offerors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  For demonstrated prior experience, 
offerors were required to provide “up to three contracts/orders” performed within the past seven years to demonstrate experience applicable to the PWS for this requirement, specifically “PWS 3.0 Technical Requ irements through 3.6.1.14.2.”  Id. at 10.  The 
TOPR informed offerors that referenced contracts “should be the Offeror’s own experience as a prime or subcontractor” and that “experience from a proposed subcontractor should not be submitted.”  Id.  A detailed narrative was required to 
describe  “how the company’s experience for these contracts/orders in supporting similar 
efforts in size (approximately 300 [full -time equivalents]  supporting 550,000 customers), 
complexity, and scope supporting Federal Government organizations is like this requirement .”  Id.  The solicitation advised that the agency would evaluate offerors’ 
submissions under the experience factor by assessing the government’s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform the requirements.  Id.  at 20. 
 For the key personnel factor, the solicitation required offerors to provide resumes for seven key positions identified in the solicitation that “clearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, 
certifications, and qualifications.”  Id.  at 10-11.  The agency would assess its level of 
confidence that the offeror had identified and committed key personnel with appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications based on, among other things, the “Table 2 
Expert -Level Position Requirements and Table 3 Key Technical Personnel 
Certifications” provided in the PWS.  Id. at 20. 
 Only those offerors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both the experience and key personnel factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.  Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and 
cost/price proposals, and provide oral presentations.  Id. at 11-18.   
 Under the betterment factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose any “betterments,” defined as “any instance where the proposed solution exceeds the Government’s requirement in a way that is meaningful for the Government.”  Id. at 16, 20.  Offerors were instructed to “provide information explaining the promise of the 
betterment and the betterment’s value to the Government.”  Id.  at 16.  The agency 
would then evaluate “the value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate 
cyber space operations across the world and all five of the RCCs.”  Id. at 20. 
  Page 4 B-423366 et al.  For oral presentations, offerors were required to “provide an oral presentation based on 
the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.”  Id. at 16.  Offerors were further informed that they should be “prepared to 
discuss their solutions . . . for Technical Approach and Staffing” to fulfill the government’s requirement.  Id.  As relevant here, the solicitation also stated that oral 
presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government.”  Id.  In addition, the 
solicitation noted that oral presentations were intended to be “an interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government” and that these exchanges would be “viewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute discussions.”  Id. 
at 17.  The agency would “not ask questions that will invite or allow the Offeror to 
change its Proposal” and warned offerors to “not volunteer any information that might be construed as changing its Proposal.”  Id.  Oral presentations would be evaluated by 
assessing the government’s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements “based on the answers provided to the questions provided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.”  Id. at 20.  If an offeror did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral 
presentation, the offeror would not be considered for award.  Id.  at 18.   
 Seven offerors, including DirectViz and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS/MOL at 20.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the 
agency conducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for offerors to update their phase I 
submissions.  Id. at 21; AR, Tab 52, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating 
the updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including DirectViz and 
Peraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II 
proposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  23; AR, Tab 65, Task 
Order Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   
 As relevant here, the agency decided not to record the oral presentations, but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) took contemporaneous notes.  COS/MOL at 23; see AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Evaluators’ Oral Presentation Notes.  
Following the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors’ oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  23; AR, 
Tab 64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1.   
 Following the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of DirectViz and Peraton were assigned the following final ratings:  
 
 DirectViz  Peraton  
Demonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Key Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Oral Presentation  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Betterment s 1 1 
Total Evaluated Cost/Price  $225,833,063  $225,089,343  
 AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.    Page 5 B-423366 et al.   
The contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the PEB’s technical evaluation reports and concurred with its findings.  Id.  at 1, 12.  The 
SSA then conducted a tradeoff analysis of offerors’ proposals under each technical factor and selected Peraton’s proposal for award, finding that DirectViz’s proposal was “not sufficiently more advantageous to the Government to warrant payi ng” the price 
premium of $743,719.  Id.  at 39-40.  The SSA noted that, while the two offerors w ere 
assigned the same ratings of high confidence under each of the first three non-cost/price factors, with one betterment each, Peraton’s proposal provided a better 
value.  Id.  at 40.  Specifically, the SSA found that Peraton demonstrated prior 
experience on contracts with “a larger size, complexity, and scope” and its proposed betterment of automated workflows increased the agency’s confidence that Peraton would provide “except ional value” for transitioning the RCC for the continental United 
States into a GCC.  Id.  Based on these findings, the Army selected Peraton for 
issuance of the task order.  Id. 
 The Army provided a debriefing to DirectViz, and this protest followed.
3   
 DISCUSSION  DirectViz raises numerous challenges to the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  First, the protester contends that Peraton is precluded from award because of unmitigated OCIs.  The protester also asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposal s under each evaluation factor and failed to sufficiently document offerors’ oral 
presentations.  Finally, the protester argues that the agency’s best -value tradeoff 
decision was flawed.   
As detailed below, we find that the agency’s OCI analysis of Peraton was unreasonable 
and sustain the protest on that basis.  We have also considered all of the remaining 
issues raised by DirectViz and, while we do not discuss every argument, we find no additional basis on which to sustain the protest.
4    
 Organizational Conflict of Interest  
 DirectViz contends that the agency failed to meaningfully consider and sufficiently investigate unmitigated OCIs arising from Peraton’s performance under a separate task 
 
3 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this 
protest is within our Office’s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the 
authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
4 In addition, we do not discuss here the protester’s challenges to the agency’s 
best-value tradeoff analysis, which are rendered academic in light of our decision 
sustaining the challenge to the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s OCI.   Page 6 B-423366 et al.  order supporting the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER).5  Protest at  26-32; Comments 
& 2nd Supp. Protest at  46-73.  The protester argues that Peraton improperly failed to 
disclose these conflicts, and that the agency failed to reasonably investigate them.  Id.  
As discussed below, based on our review of the record, we find that the agency failed to 
adequately consider an impaired objectivity OCI arising from Peraton’s work under the ARCYBER task order.  
 The FAR requires contracting officials to identify and evaluate organization conflicts of interests as early as possible, and to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts so as to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the existenc e of conflicting 
roles that might impair a contractor’s objectivity.  FAR 9.504(a), 9.505.  The identification of conflicts of interest is a fact -specific inquiry that requires the exercise of 
considerable discretion.  MANDEX, Inc., B -421664 et al., Aug.  16, 2023, 2023 CPD 
¶ 201 at  5.  To successfully allege a conflict of interest, a protester must identify hard 
facts that indicate the existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough.  AAR Mfg. Inc., d/b/a AAR Mobility Sys ., B-418339, Mar.  17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  106 at  5.  Our Office reviews OCI 
investigations for reasonableness, and where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether a significant conflict of interest exists, we will not substitute our judgment for  the agency’s absent clear evidence that the agency’s conclusion is 
unreasonable.  Inquiries, Inc.,  B-417415.2, Dec.  30, 2019, 2020 CPD ¶  54 at  6. 
  Additional Background 
 As noted above, the awardee will be required to provide cybersecurity information 
technology support services for the GCC.  The scope of the work, as described in the 
PWS, encompasses “operation and maintenance [] functions, as well as [the] integration of emerging and directed technology adoption, . . . common service support, capability 
management support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  The 
wide range of technical support envisioned also includes capability management support for NETCOM and enterprise services division to provide secure operations for the enterprise network infrastructure.  Id. at 3-9.   
 On December 7, 2023, Peraton was awarded a separate Army task order, under the General Services Administration’s (GSA) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated 
 
5 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to consider OCIs arising from 
Peraton’s performance on the predecessor task order to the current ARCYBER task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 73 74.  After reviewing the supplemental agency report,  the protester withdrew its allegation of an impaired objectivity OCI based 
on this predecessor task order but maintained that Peraton had biased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  Supp. Comments at 38 n.9.  For the same reasons discussed herein with respect to the allegations of biased ground rules and unequal access OCIs arising from the ARCYBER task order, we find no merit to these OCI assertions arising from the predecessor task order.   Page 7 B-423366 et al.  Services (OASIS) multiple -award IDIQ contract, to “provide cyberspace operations 
support services for ARCYBER Headquarters[], ARCYBER subordinate components, 
service component partners of USCYBERCOM, and other cyber mission partners.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  1, 8.  The expansive requirements under the 
ARCYBER task order include the provision of:  overarching program management support; intelligence support; cyberspace operations support; planning, strategy, policy, and doctrine support; DODIN mi ssion support; readiness, training, and exercises 
support; and communication and collaboration support.  Id. at 9-50.  Peraton also 
“provide[s] cyberspace operations support,” not only “for ARCYBER Headquarters,” but also for “ARCYBER subordinate components, service component partners of USCYBERCOM, and other cyber mission partners.”  Id. at 8.   
 In explaining the relevant command relationship between ARCYBER and GCC, the GCC task order PWS explains that ARCYBER is the “primary Army headquarters responsible for cyberspace operations in support of Army and Joint requirements” and that it serves as t he single point of contact “for reporting and assessing Army 
cyberspace incidents, events, and operations in Army networks, and for synchronizing and integrating Army responses thereto.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  As a subordinate unit 
to ARCYBER, NETCOM “ plans, engineers, installs, integrates, protects, and operates 
Army Cyberspace, enabling Mission Command through all phases of Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational operations .”  Id.  Under NETCOM, the 7th Signal 
Command is responsible for “delivering seamless, Enterprise- level Army Information 
Technology Portfolio common- user services and operating, managing, and defending 
the Enterprise [information technology] infrastructure in support of the” continental U.S. Army.  Id.  GCC is part of t he 7th Signal Command.  Id.  The GCC PWS further explains 
that “ARCYBER plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, directs, and conducts an integrated defense within all Army networks, and as directed, within the DODIN.”  Id.   
 As relevant here, the solicitation required offerors to “disclose complete information of any work performed by their company that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition or which could result in a potential [OCI].”  TOPR at  9.  An OCI 
mitigation plan was only required if the firm identified an actual or potential OCI.  Id.  
Peraton’s proposal stated that it was “not currently aware of any facts which create any actual or potential [OCI] relating to this opportunity” and thus did not prov ide any OCI 
mitigation plan.  AR, Tab 38, Peraton Proposal General Vol. at  5.   
 Based on DirectViz’s allegations in its initial and second supplemental protests, the contracting officer conducted two rounds of  investigations into potential OCIs arising 
from Peraton’s performance of the ARCYBER task order.   COS/MOL at 27; see 
generally, AR, Tab  71, OCI Determination.   After reviewing relevant documents --
including the PWS of each task order, declarations from the technical lead for the GCC task order and the acquisition chief for the ARCYBER task order, and Peraton’s responses to OCI questionnaires --the contracting officer concluded that no OCIs 
existed.  AR, Tab 71, OCI Determination at  2.  DirectViz disputes this conclusion and 
argues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton’s potential OCIs.  Comments & 2nd Supp.  Protest at 44- 73; Supp. Comments at  48-53.  Page 8 B-423366 et al.    
Impaired Objectivity OCI  
 The protester argues that Peraton has an unmitigated impaired objectivity OCI.

Office has explained that an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm’s ability to 
render impartial advice to the government would be undermined by the firm’s competing interests.  FAR 9.505(a); AT&T Corp ., B-417107.4, July  2, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  283 at  6.  
Here, the protester asserts that an OCI arises from the broad cyber support that Peraton provides to ARCYBER, including support for the GCC, one of ARCYBER’s subordinate components.  Protest at  26-30.  In this regard, the protester points to 
specific provisions in the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton to assist ARCYBER with 
 
6 The protester also alleges that Peraton’s work on the ARCYBER task order also raises 
biased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  A  biased ground rules 
OCI arises where a firm, as part of its performance of a government contract, has in some sense set the ground rules for the competition for another government contract .  
FAR 9.505- 1, 9.505- 2.  In these cases, the primary concern is that the firm could skew 
the competition, whether intentionally or not, in favor of itself.   Systems Made Simple, 
Inc., B-412948.2, July  20, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 207 at 6.  DirectViz, however, does not 
provide any support for its argument that Peraton actually participated in any activity that could have shaped or skewed the requirements for the GCC task order in its favor.  The protester’s inference based on the portions of the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton’s support to develop agency -wide cyber policy and strategy, without more, does 
not constitute the hard facts  required to evidenc e Peraton’s participation in activities 
giving rise to a biased ground rules OCI .  See Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, 
Sept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  332 at  8 (protester s must identify hard facts that show the 
existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough).  
We likewise find no basis to sustain the protester’s allegation of an unequal access to information OCI.  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract.  FAR 9.505(b), 9.505- 4; Cyberdata Techs., Inc. , 
B-411070 et al., May  1, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶  150 at  6.  Other than general conjecture 
about overarching policy and strategic information that Peraton could have encountered 
at planning meetings, DirectViz does not describe any specific information that reasonably constitutes non- public information that could have provided Peraton with a 
competitive advantage.  Moreover, with respect to high- level knowledge of the agency’s 
general priorities, the protester has not shown that such information is beyond the unique information, advantages, and capabilities  that a vendor may possess  due to its 
prior experience under a government contract .  The government is not necessarily 
required to equalize competition to compensate for such normally occurring 
advantages , unless there is evidence of preferential treatment or other improper action.  
See Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, Sept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  332 at  6; CACI, Inc. -
Fed.,  B-403064.2, Jan.  28, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶  31 at  10.    Page 9 B-423366 et al.  shaping overarching cyber policies and plans for its subordinate components, which 
include GCC, creating opportunities for Peraton to influence decisions at the ARCYBER level to benefit Peraton’s work at the GCC.  Id.   The protester also asserts that 
Peraton’s role under the ARCYBER task order allows Peraton to provide biased advice to ARCYBER about deliverables Peraton would provide under the GCC task order.  Id.     
 Based on our review of the record, we agree with the protester that a significant potential conflict  of interest arises from Peraton’s competing roles  under the ARCYBER 
and GCC task orders, which might impair Peraton’s  objectivity  in the performance of its 
obligations under the two task orders.  In this regard, we find that the contracting officer’s conclusions that Peraton is “not authorized to structure policies for the GCC Government personnel on the ARCYBER Task Order” and “does not provide guidance/advice on how the GCC Task Order [contractor] handles its cyber operations,”  
see AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11, are not supported by the record, 
specifically the express terms of the PWS for the respective task orders.    
 For example, the cyberspace operational support task of the ARCYBER task order explains that ARCYBER cyberspace operations “maintain[] Operational Control [] over the RCCs”
7 and “monitor[] and ingest[] information throughout the RCCs and facilitate[] 
information flow directly to the ARCYBER Commander.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  33.  Under this task, however, Peraton as the ARCYBER contractor must 
“assist in cyberspa ce operations planning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing, and 
conducting cyberspace operations and defense of the Army networks,” as well as “develop and maintain [standard operating procedures (SOP)] and [tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)]  pertinent to all cyberspace operations services.”  Id.  Peraton 
must also “[r]eview, assess, and recommend courses of action in response to confirmed, potential threat activity, and unknown/new vulnerabilities.”  Id.  at 35.   
 At the same time, under the GCC task order, Peraton would support “services to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational support services for both the GCC and the Warfighter.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  28.  Within this task, Peraton would be 
requir ed to “perform cybersecurity services to secure DODIN -[Army] information 
systems and networks” as dictated by applicable DOD and Army security policies and procedures, as well as “establish vulnerability management process to identify, classify, prioritize , remediate and/or mitigate, verify, and document existing vulnerabilities to the 
network and information systems.”  Id.   
 These overlapping responsibilities set up an inherent conflict of interest and provide an incentive for Peraton to provide biased advice to the government.  For instance, while Peraton assists ARCYBER to develop SOPs and TTPs that would govern cyberspace 
operations at the GCC, Peraton has an incentive to align these policies and procedures 
with its own capabilities to perform cybersecurity services under the GCC task order.  Moreover, even as Peraton establishes a vulnerability management process for DODIN 
 
7 As explained above, GCC is considered one of the RCCs for the purpose of the 
command relationship with respect to ARCYBER.   Page 10 B-423366 et al.  under the GCC task order, it would be in position to “[r]eview, assess, and recommend 
courses of action in response to . . . vulnerabilities” under the ARCYBER task order, where Peraton would have the opportunity and incentive to favorably assess the vulnerability management process at GCC.  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35. 
 As another example, Peraton is required to “assist in planning, coordinating, and synchronizing DODIN operations” under the ARCYBER task order, which includes the responsibility not only to “architect, build, configure, secure, operate, maintain, and susta in networks and information,” but also to “support mission assurance efforts, to 
include the assessment and implementation of cybersecurity policies [and] programs.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  40.  As part of this effort, Peraton must 
“[c]onduct network and infrastructure plans and assessments  for the adoption and 
implementation of enterprise services, such as cybersecurity” and “[p]rovide weekly updates” on the “status of the implementation plans.”  Id.   
 Under the GCC task order, however, Peraton is responsible for “secur[ing], operat[ing], and maintain[ing]” DODIN’s internet protocol networks in accordance with ARCYBER -
developed policies and programs, and for providing “Operational Oversight” for the “[c]oordination, partnering, and reporting through other DODIN -[Army] service 
providers,” including ARCYBER.  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  4, 17.  Thus, as Peraton carries 
out its duty under the ARCYBER task order to assess and implement cybersecurity policies for DODIN operations, it is in a position to favorably assess and report on 
GCC’s implementation of cybersecurity plans, which have been performed by Peraton under the GCC task order.   
 
A similar conflict arises from Peraton’s duties under the information assurance task of the ARCYBER task order, which include “real -time management and surveillance of the 
Army’s portion of the DODIN,” and require Peraton to “[c]oordinate with . . . RCCs .  . . 
on outages and matters that require escalation to resolve technical deficiencies.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35.  Mirroring this requirement, the GCC task order 
requires the awardee to provide “24/7 operational oversight, support, and maintenance of all GCC- managed services residing on the Army’s . . . portion of the DODIN -[Army],” 
including the responsibility to “track and report incidents/outages as outlined in the established SOPs, policy, and guidance.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  16.  The GCC contractor 
is also required to “develop [after action reports] to document the entirety of the issue, response, and remediation from a holistic perspective across the DODIN which is inclusive of all relevant Service Providers (e.g., . . . ARCYBER . . .).”  Id.  Under these 
interrelated tasks, it is seemingly possible for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to be put in the position of determining and reporting on whether an outage incident at the GCC --as managed by Peraton as the GCC contractor --requires 
“escalation to resolve technical deficiencies.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order 
at 35.  In such a scenario, Peraton would have both the incentive and the opportunity to 
skew its ARCYBER report to put its work under the GCC task order in the most  
favorable light rather than objectively assessing the effectiveness of its own work.  
  Page 11 B-423366 et al.  The above examples illustrate just a few instances where the interplay between the 
ARCYBER task order and the GCC task order could potentially create an impaired objectivity OCI for a contractor performing on both task orders.  In this regard, our Office has sustained allegations of impaired objectivity OCI where the terms of a previously 
awarded contract or task order would require a contractor to advise the agency on work in which it has a competing interest because of its role in the protested award.  Se e 
MANDEX, Inc., supra at 11-12.   
 In MANDEX, we found that the agency’s determination (that there was no impaired 
objectivity OCI) was unreasonable where the contracting officer failed to consider the full scope of PWS provisions requiring the awardee, performing under a previously awarded task order, to provide input about its work and performance under the protested award.  See id.  In Inquiries, Inc., we sustained an allegation of an impaired 
objectivity OCI where the role of the awardee’s subcontractor under the protested contract would affect its ability to provide unbiased services under a project 
management task order previously awarded to the subcontractor.  See Inquiries, Inc., 
supra at 8-9.  Similarly, here, we find that the plain terms of the two task orders’ 
performance requirements raise a significant potential impaired objectivity OCI, where Peraton’s ability to provide unbiased advice under the ARCYBER task order is impaired by its competing interest as the contractor performing the GCC task order.  
  Inadequate OCI Investigation  
 The protester also argues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton’s OCI because the contracting officer did not examine the work Peraton performs under 
the ARCYBER task order in relation to the work it would perform under the GCC task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  44-46, 62- 70.  Based on our review of the 
record before us, we agree.   
 Despite the contracting officer’s conclusion that no OCI arises from Peraton’s roles under the two task orders, neither of the two OCI determinations show any analysis with respect to the work required to be performed under the PWSs of the respective task orders.  In this regard, although the contracting officer conducted two rounds of OCI investigations based on the protest allegations, neither OCI determination addresses any of the specific sections of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC PWS that the protester cites as potentially giving rise to an impaired objectivity OCI.  See generally,  
AR, Tab  71, OCI Determination; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination.  Instead, the 
contracting officer’s analysis of an impaired objectivity OCI relies entirely on:  (1) conclusory declarations of the contracting officer representative (COR) for the GCC 
task order and an acquisition official for ARCYBER; (2) self -serving statements from 
Peraton that patently conflict with the plain terms of the PWSs; and (3)  the role of 
government officials providing final sign- off on contractor work products.  See AR, 
Tab 71, OCI Determination at  9-10; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11-14.  As 
further discussed below, we find the contracting officer’s reliance on these aspects of its investigation without an independent analysis of the respective PWSs to be unreasonable.   Page 12 B-423366 et al.   
First, the record shows that the declarations provided by the GCC task order COR and the ARCYBER acquisition official were entirely conclusory and, like the contracting officer’s OCI determinations, lacked any analysis of the specific PWS provisions, including those painstakingly enumerated by the protester.  See AR, Tab 71w, Decl. of 
GCC COR at  1-2; AR, Tab 71x, Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-2; AR, Tab  81, 2nd 
Decl. of GCC COR at 1 -3; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-4.  For 
example, both the GCC COR and the ARCYBER Official conclude, without any documented analysis of specific PWS sections, that “ARCYBER does not provide guidance or advice on how the GCC handles its cyber operations . . . . [and] ARCYBER does not dictate how the GCC execute any part of its mission.”  AR, Tab 81, 2nd Decl. 
of GCC COR at 2; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  2.  The contracting 
officer, in his OCI determinations, adopts these conclusory statements without any additional analysis of the work required t o be performed by Peraton under the two task 
orders.  However, as discussed above, the declarants’ conclusory remarks are belied by the ARCYBER PWS provisions requiring Peraton to assist ARCYBER in developing policies and strategies governing the cyber operations at the GCC level, as well as the GCC PWS requiring the GCC contractor to take operational direction from ARCYBER.  Thus, we find unreasonable the contracting officer’s wholesale adoption of these declarants’ conclusory statements without independently analyzing the work required under the two task orders.  
 Second, we also find unreasonable the contracting officer’s reliance on Peraton’s responses to OCI questions where the responses plainly conflicted with the terms of the respective PWS.  In this regard, in responding “No” to the question asking whether 
Peraton “through the ARCYBER task order provide[s] advice about GCC cyber 
operations,” Peraton provided a list of areas where it only provides technical support for “an inherent Governmental function and responsibility performed only by Government personnel.”   Tab 71y, Peraton Responses to OCI Questions at  3-4.  The plain terms of 
the ARCYBER task order, however, list those same tasks as part of the contractor’s responsibility.  For example, Peraton states that “ Government personnel  in ARCYBER 
HQs are responsible for providing intelligence support to the RCCs/GCC and for conducting all -source analysis and production support for full spectrum cyberspace 
operations and planning.”  Id. at 4 (emphasis added).  The ARCYBER PWS, however, 
provides that “[t]he contractor  shall provide all -source intelligence support for the RCCs” 
and “[c]onduct all -source analysis and production support to full spectrum cyberspace 
operations and planning at the RCCs .”  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  25 
(emphasis added).  The contracting officer’s OCI determination relies on the awardee’s 
self-serving responses without meaningfully considering the actual PWS provisions that 
gave rise to the OCI concerns  and, in so doing, fails to note the inconsistenc ies 
between Peraton’s statements a nd the clearly stated PWS requirements under the 
ARCYBER task order .  See AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-14.   
 Third, in light of the contracting officer’s failure to recognize any potential OCI from Peraton’s competing roles under the two task orders --as well as Peraton’s statement 
that it has no OCIs to disclose or mitigate, see AR, Tab  38, Peraton Proposal General  Page 13 B-423366 et al.  Vol. at  5--we find that the OCI concerns here are not mitigated by the contracting 
officer’s general reliance on the role of agency officials.  In this regard, the contracting 
officer explains that “any input received [by GCC] from ARCYBER would be from Government personnel only” and that “even if Peraton did provide support for [the GCC] 
task order, any product that GCC sends to ARCYBER has to be coordinated and approved” by government officials.  AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12.  The 
contracting officer further concludes that, because “Peraton’s advice to GCC would be limited to technical, objective advice reviewed by Government personnel,” it “could not give rise to an opportunity for Peraton to shade that advice to benefit its other contract team .”  Id. at 13.   
 Our Office has explained, however, that the fact that agency officials must approve any recommendations from the contractor does not inherently mitigate the risk that the advice received from the contractor could be biased.  See Inquiries, Inc., supra at  10 
(“We conclude that the contracting officer’s blanket reliance on the requirement that changes must be approved by government personnel does not reasonably show that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to the risk of impaired objectivity  
OCIs.”).  As noted, the purpose of an OCI review is to determine whether a firm’s advice to the government would be impaired by conflicting duties or interests.  AT&T Corp ., 
supra.   Here, as discussed above, the expansive contractor  responsibilities under the 
ARCYBER task order require Peraton to “[p]rovide assistance in the development, inspection, evaluation, and oversight of cybersecurity policies and procedures” for the ARCYBER headquarters and its subordinate components that specifically include the GCC.  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order  at 41.  We conclude that the final approval 
of government personnel for these policies and procedures before they are deployed to 
GCC does not resolve the risk that Peraton’s ability to provide objective advice on such policies and procedures might be impaired by its interest in benefiting Peraton’s work under the GCC task order.  
 Finally, to the extent the contracting officer relied on the fact that the two task orders are administered by two different acquisition offices or the statement that Peraton would not be involved in evaluating contractor performance, we find such reliance to be 
misplaced.  In this regard, the contracting officer concluded that there is no opportunity for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to direct its work under the GCC task order because the ARCYBER task order was issued under GSA’s OASIS IDIQ contract, which was managed by a contracting office separate from the one managing the GCC task order issued under the Army’s CHESS -ITESS IDIQ contract.  
AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-13.  The contracting officer further concluded  
that Peraton would not be evaluating its own work because the evaluation of contractor performance in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) 
will be completed by government personnel without any contractor input or access .  Id. 
at 13-14.   
In light of the circumstances here, we find that both of these lines of inquiry are irrelevant  to determining whether there is an impaired objectivity OCI.  Again, the 
purpose of an impaired objectivity OCI review is to determine whether the firm’s advice to the government  in the performance of the requirements would be impaired by  Page 14 B-423366 et al.  conflicting duties or interests.  Here, the fact that the two task orders were issued under 
different contract vehicles or are administered by different contracting offices has no bearing on whether the ability of the same contractor to render objective services under one task order may be impaired by its competing interest in performing the other task order.  Likewise, when questioning whether the contractor would be evaluating its own work, the concern is not with the evaluation of contractor performance in CPARS, but on whether the contractor, during the performance of its duties under one contract, would be tasked with evaluating or assessing its own product or services provided under a different contract.   
 In sum, we find that the contracting officer unreasonably failed to meaningfully consider whether the work Peraton is required to perform under the terms of the respective PWSs of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC task order would impair Peraton’s ability  to provide objective and unbiased services to the agency.  As discussed above, 
the plain terms of the respective PWSs include several overlapping responsibilities with significant potential for an impaired objectivity OCI in Peraton’s performance of both task orders, yet the contracting officer’s OCI investigation did not address any of these PWS provisions.  In light of this missing analysis, we have no basis to conclude that the OCI determination was reasonable or sufficient .  We therefore sustain the protest on 
this basis.  
 Demonstrated Prior Experience  
 The protester argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals under the demonstrated prior experience factor.  Specifically, the protester contends that the 
agency failed to give sufficient credit for DirectViz’s highly relevant experience under the incumbent task order.  The protester also asserts that the agency improperly credited the awardee’s proposal for the experience of its subsidiary entities.  Based on our review of the record, we find no merit to these arguments.  
 The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc., 
B-419271.5 et al., Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  191 at  7.  In reviewing protests of an 
award in a task order competition, we do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria and applicable 
procurement laws and regulations.  Technatomy Corp.,  B-411583, Sept.  4, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 282 at 4- 5.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation 
judgment, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  
  Protester’s Incumbent Experience  
 The protester first asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to identify additional distinguishing benefits for DirectViz’s demonstrated prior experience as the contractor  Page 15 B-423366 et al.  currently performing the incumbent effort under the predecessor task order.  Protest 
at 33-40.  In this regard, the protester argues that aspects of its highly similar work 
performed on the incumbent effort deserved more recognition in the agency’s evaluat ion 
and best -value tradeoff.  Id.; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  15-16.   
 The agency responds that it evaluated the protester’s experience submission reasonably and in accordance with the solicitation.  Specifically, the agency contends that the protester received the highest possible rating based on its incumbent experience and was not entitled to receive any additional credit.  COS/MOL at  48-50.   
 The record shows that the protester submitted one experience reference in its proposal, describing its incumbent effort on the predecessor task order supporting the Army’s RCC- CONUS.  AR, Tab  27, DirectViz Experience Proposal at  7.  In assigning the 
highes t rating possible, high confidence, the agency noted that DirectViz’s experience 
“demonstrated that it is familiar with the Global Cyber Center [] mission.”  AR, Tab 60, 
DirectViz Experience Evaluation at  1.  The agency also found that DirectViz 
“demonstra ted experience on a contract of similar size and scope with the services 
identified in [PWS] para[graphs] 3.0 to 3.6.1.14.2.”  Id.  In the comparative analysis of 
DirectViz and Peraton’s proposals, however, the SSA noted that while both offerors received the rating of high confidence under the demonstrated prior experience factor, Peraton’s experience under a contract with the Navy’s  Next Generation Enterprise 
Network (NGEN) had “a larger size, complexity, and scope than” the instant requirement.  AR, Tab 65, TODD at  39. 
 On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s 
incumbent experience.  First, our Office has explained that there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  Candor Sols., LLC , 
B-417950.5, B -417950.6, May  10, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  199 at  15.  An offeror’s belief that 
its incumbency status entitles it to higher ratings or additional assessed strengths does not provide a basis for finding that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  See id.  
 In addition, the agency explains that the scope of work under the instant solicitation was anticipated to include work beyond the scope of the incumbent task order.  COS/MOL at 3-5, 48- 49.  In this regard, the solicitation specified that “[a] dditional potential, 
anticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning from a 
RCC to a [GCC] that helps support better coordination of digital operations across the 
world .”  TOPR at  1; see also id. at 16, 20 (requiring proposed betterments to exceed 
requirements in a way that is meaningful for the agency “for transitioning from [a RCC] to a [GCC] that coordinates better digital operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.”).  Based on this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s conclusion that the protester’s incumbent experience did not warrant any extra recognition beyond the assigned rating of high confidence.  
  Awardee’s Affiliate Experience  
  Page 16 B-423366 et al.  The protester also challenges the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s demonstrated 
prior experience, alleging that the agency improperly credited Peraton for the experience of the firm’s affiliate entities.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  6-15.  The 
record shows that Perat on submitted two experience references, both performed by its 
wholly owned subsidiary entities --Peraton Technology Services, Inc. and Peraton 
Enterprise Solutions, LLC.  AR, Tab 39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  The 
protester argues that Peraton’s proposal did not warrant this credit because it did not clearly show these affiliates’ involvement in the performance of the task order.  Id.   The 
agency responds that the solicitation did not prohibit the submission of affiliate experience as an offeror’s own experience and that Peraton’s proposal sufficiently described the commitment of its affiliate resources for performing the instant requi rement.  Supp. COS/MOL at  7-30.  Based on our review of the record, we agree 
with the agency.  
 An agency properly may attribute the experience or past performance of a parent or affiliated company to an offeror where the firm’s proposal demonstrates that the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  Alutiiq Pac., 
LLC, B-409584, B -409584.2, June 18, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶  196 at  4.  The relevant 
consideration is whether the resources of the parent or affiliated company --its workforce, 
management, facilities or other resources --will be provided or relied upon for contr act 
performance such that the parent or affiliate will have meaningful involvement in contract performance.  Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023  CPD ¶ 92.  
 Here, the awardee’s proposal reflects the meaningful involvement of its affiliate entities.  Specifically, Peraton’s demonstrated experience volume explained that Peraton 
“manages its combined business, including all subsidiaries , with a centralized 
leadership structure, consolidated business systems, and common practices, personnel, and other resources to effectively serve multiple government customers worldwide.”  AR, Tab  39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  Moreover, the proposal expressly 
stated as follows:  
 
. . . the personnel, resources, and qualifications offered and committed in this proposal, including those in the corporate experience and past performance citations relied on herein--specifically, ARCYBER [Cyberspace Operations Support] Contract, held by Peraton subsidiary Peraton Technology Services Inc., and NGEN Contract, held by Peraton 
subsidiary Peraton Enterprise Solutions LLC, under its former name, 
Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC --are fully available and attributable to 
Peraton for the successf ul performance of the requirements of this 
solicitation.  
  Page 17 B-423366 et al.  Id.8  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably relied on the stated 
performance commitment of Peraton’s affiliate resources to attribute the experience of 
those affiliated companies to the awardee.    The protester argues that the agency’s arguments in this regard should be disregarded as impermissible post hoc rationalizations because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not include any discussion of Peraton’s affiliate entities.  Supp. Comments at  13-19.  To support its post -protest explanations, the agency submitted a 
declaration from the technical chai r of the PEB stating that the evaluators “reviewed the 
information submitted regarding Peraton’s corporate acquisitions and structure,” and “concluded that Peraton had demonstrated sufficient integration and reliance on the 
affiliates’ resources to treat their experience as the offeror’s own.”  AR, Tab  83, 
Technical Chair Decl. at  2-3. 
 Our Office has explained that, in reviewing an agency’s evaluation, we will not limit our review to contemporaneously documented evidence, but instead will consider all the information provided, including a party’s arguments and explanations.  American Sys. Corp ., B-420132 et al., Dec. 13, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  387 at  10.  Although we generally 
give little or no weight to reevaluations and judgments prepared in the heat of the adversarial process, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed rationale for 
contemporaneous conclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded details, will generally be considered in our review, as long as those explanations are credible and  
consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id.  Here, we find the agency’s post -
protest explanation to be credible and consistent with the contemporaneous evaluation 
record, which does not include any reason to call into question the commitment of these 
affiliate resources in the performance of the t ask order.

8 Since the solicitation did not require a technical approach proposal, Peraton’s 
commitment of its subsidiary resources was provided as part of the demonstrated 
experience volume of its proposal.  
9 DirectViz also contends that it was improper for the agency to consider one of 
Peraton’s two experience references because it was for work performed under an IDIQ contract rather than an individual task order under that contract.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  12-15.  As the agency points out, however, the solicitation required 
offerors to submit “up to three contracts/orders” performed within the past seven years to demonstrate their prior experience and to describe how the firm’s “experience for these contracts/orders in supporting similar efforts” is like the instant requirement.  
Supp. COS/MOL at 25; see TOPR at  10.  The language of the solicitation, therefore, 
permitted offerors to submit references by describing work performed at the IDIQ contract level.  Accordingly, we find no basis to object to the agency’s consideration of Peraton’s experience under an IDIQ contract.   Page 18 B-423366 et al.  Key Personnel Resumes  
 
The protester next argues that the agency erroneously assigned a rating of high confidence to the awardee’s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor when Peraton’s proposed virtualization/cloud computing senior subject matter expert (SME) did not meet the minimum certification requirement.  Protest at  45-47; Comments & 2nd 
Supp. Protest at  16-20.  Specifically, the protester asserts that the solicitation required a 
“VMware Certified Advanced Professional” for this position, but Peraton’s proposed key  
person was only a “VMware Certified Professional.”  Id.  The agency responds that the 
protester mistakenly refers to the requirement for a different position.  In this regard, the Army asserts that the solicitation only required a “VMware Certified Professional” certification (without the “advanced” designation)  for the  proposed virtualization/cloud 
computing senior SME.  COS/MOL at  52-54.   
 The solicitation here required offerors to submit resumes for seven key positions, including a “ Virtualization/Cloud Computing Senior [SME] .”  TOPR at  10.  The solicitation 
advised that submitted resumes “shall clearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications” based on two PWS -provided tables: table 2, expert -level positions 
requirements, and table 3, key technical personnel certifications.  Id.  at 10-11.  The 
virtualization/cloud computing senior SME position only appears on table 3.  AR, Tab 22, 
PWS at  52.  As listed in table 3, the position required a “VMware Certified Professional” 
certification, as well as a number of cloud- related certifications.  Id .   
 On the other hand, table 2, which described “some functional areas [that] require expert 
level expertise,” included the position of a “Virtualization Infrastructure Senior [SME]” among the 16 functional areas/positions.  Id.  at 50-51.  Table 2 specified that the 
visualization infrastructure senior SME be a “VMware Certified Advanced Professional.”  
Id. at 51 (emphasis added).  Although the protester argues that the virtualization 
infrastructure  senior SME in table 2 and the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME 
in table 3 are one and the same key position, the plain reading of the solicitation language does not support this interpretation.  
 Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s actual requirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.  Karthik Consulting, LLC, B -421610.2, May  31, 
2023, 2023  CPD ¶ 134 at  2.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning 
of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; t o be reasonable, and therefore 
valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole 
and in a reasonable manner.  Crew Training Int ’l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb. 7, 2017, 
2017 CPD ¶ 53 at 4.  An ambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations 
of the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible; a patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error.  FFLPro, LLC,  
B-411427.2, Sept.  22, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶  289 at  10.  Where a patent ambiguity is not 
challenged prior to the submission of solicitation responses, we will not consider  Page 19 B-423366 et al.  subsequent untimely arguments asserting the protester’s own interpretation of the 
ambiguous provisions.  Id.  
 As an initial matter, we note that the solicitation here required resumes for seven key personnel positions.  However, table 2 lists 16 (not 7) positions and specifies that these positions are for functional areas that require “expert level expertise.”  AR , Tab 22, PWS 
at 50.  With respect to these positions, the PWS notes that the contractor would be 
required to “retain personnel with management and technical knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience needed to accomplish the performance of work under this task order,” but contains no specific proposal submission requirements.  Id.  The PWS 
also specifically notes that “[s]ome, but not[] all[,] expert -level positions will also be 
identified as key technical positions.”  Id.  Indeed, a review of the two tables shows little 
overlap between the 16 positions listed in table 2 and the 7 “Key Technical Personnel” 
positions listed in table 3.  Compare id.  at 50-51 with id.  at 52.  For example, the 
required key positions of network senior SME and cyber security senior SME are listed among the key personnel positions in table 3 without any directly equivalent positions 
among the expert -level positions in table 2.  Id.  
 Further, the record shows that the two positions --virtualization infrastructure senior SME 
and virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME --have materially different certification 
requirements in addition to the VMware certification.  The virtualization infrastructure senior SME position requires a “[Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)]:  Core Infrastructure” certification , while the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME requires 
a cloud- related certification of “Azure Administrator Associate OR  AWS Certified 
Solutions Architect --Associate . . . OR CompTIA Cloud+” or “MCSE Cloud Platform & 
Infrastructure.”  Id. at 51-52.   
 Reading the solicitation as a whole in a manner that gives effect to these provisions, the only reasonable interpretation is that the virtualization infrastructure senior SME detailed in table 2 and the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME in table 3 are two different 
positions.  Of the two, only the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME is designated 
as a key person to be evaluated under the key personnel resume factor, and this position requires a VMware certification without the “advanced” designation.  Moreover, even if it was reasonable for the protester to interpret the two positions to be one and the same, solicitation terms providing different certification requirements for the same position would be an obvious or glaring error that constitutes a patent ambiguity, which should have been protested prior to the submission of solicitation responses.  FFLPro, LLC,  supra.   We will not now consider the protester’s untimely arguments asserting its 
own interpretation of the patently ambiguous provisi on.  
 The record here shows --and the protester does not dispute--that Peraton’s resume for 
its proposed virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME had the VMware certified 
professional certification.  See AR, Tab  40, Peraton’s Key Personnel Proposal at  13.  
Accordingly, we find nothing unreasonable in the agency’s finding that the awardee’s proposed virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME satisfied the solicitation’s 
certification requirement.     Page 20 B-423366 et al.  Betterment  
 
The protester next asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to credit DirectViz’s proposal for multiple additional betterments.  Protest at  59-64.  The protester also 
contends that the agency treated offerors disparately by crediting Peraton with a betterment for proposing data- driven dashboards while failing to credit DirectViz for a 
similar aspect of its proposal.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency 
responds that it evaluated the offerors’ proposed betterments in accordance with the solicitation and asserts that the protester’s arguments amount to nothing more than 
disagreement with the agency’s reasonable judgment.  COS/MOL at  73-76; Supp. 
COS/MOL at 39-43.  Based on our review of the record, we agree with the agency.  
 As noted above, the solicitation instructed offerors to propose “betterments,” defined as any instance where the proposed solution exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  TOPR at  16, 20.  Proposed betterments would be evaluated 
for “the value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate cyber space operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.”  Id.  at 20.  In evaluating m ultiple 
betterments listed in DirectViz’s proposal, the agency found that only one of them offered a betterment that exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  See AR, Tab  63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1-2.  While the protester 
claims that all of its proposed betterments deserved credit, the record provides no basis for questioning the agency’s evaluative judgment.  
 For example, the agency declined to find a betterment in the protester’s proposal of a 
centralized service delivery for a global network because “it is currently a requirement under [PWS] paragraph 3.3.3.1.”  Id.  at 1.  The agency supplements this record by 
further explaining that the protester’s description of its centralized service delivery did not meaningfully exceed the cited PWS requirement for the contractor to “perform . . . support functions to remotely operate, monitor, sustain, and secure the Ent erprise 
network within GCC responsibility boundaries.”  AR, Tab 83, Technical Evaluation 
Board (TEB) Chair Decl. at  6; AR, Tab 22, PWS  § 3.3.3.1.  While the protester 
disagrees with this assessment, it does not meaningfully explain how its proposed betterm ent exceeded the PWS requirement.   
   
The protester also asserts that the agency treated DirectViz and Peraton disparately when the agency credited a betterment for Peraton’s proposed dashboard approach while declining to credit a betterment for a similar aspect of DirectViz’s proposal.  Comme nts & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency responds that the difference in 
the evaluation is directly attributable to the differences in the offerors’ proposals.  Supp. COS/MOL at 39-41.   
 It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must treat all  offerors  equally and evaluate proposals  evenhandedly against the solicitation’ s 
requirements and evaluation criteria.  See UltiSat, Inc., B-416809 et al., Dec.  18, 2018, 
2019 CPD ¶ 6 at 9.  Where a protester  alleges unequal treatment in a technical  Page 21 B-423366 et al.  evaluation, it must show that the differences in the evaluation did not stem  from 
differences between the proposals .  See Camber Corp., B -413505, Nov. 10, 2016, 2016 
CPD ¶ 350 at  8.  To prevail on an allegation of disparate treatment, a protester must 
show that the agency  unreasonably downgraded its proposal  for aspects that were 
substantively indistinguishable from, or nearly  identical to, those contained in other 
proposals .  See Battelle Mem'l Inst., B -418047.3, B -418047.4, May  18, 2020,  2020 CPD 
¶ 176 at  5. 
 
Here, the agency found one betterment in each of DirectViz’s and Peraton’s proposals.  See AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.  Peraton’s betterment was assessed for the firm’s 
approach to automated workflows, which “uses the Army’s existing tool suite . . . to create data- driven dashboards that enable the Army to fuse, interpret, and visualize 
large amount s of data.”  AR, Tab 62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  The 
evaluators detailed their rationale for this finding as follows:  
 
As the [GCC] scope of responsibilities grows in breadth and depth, responding to the Army’s information technology needs will become more demanding.  This value- added method provides the GCC with additional 
technical experience in the tool suite identified above in the Offeror’s 
proposal.  Also, the method leans on software tools provided by existing systems of record, such as Army 365, thereby preventing further tools adoption ( i.e. tool bloat).  Employing methods that augment system of 
records, such as Ar my Enterprise Service Management Platform 
(AESMP), will enable the GCC to perform newer obligations more effectively and efficiently.  This is above what is required in the PWS, 
Appendix C, Table 2: Incident Management Standards, (1)  Critical Incident 
Resp onse rates of 94 [percent] within an hour, (2) High-  and medium -
priority incidents exceed response rates of 92 [percent] within 2 core hours and 5 core hours, respectively.  
 Id.     
 While the protester asserts that it also deserved credit for proposing data- driven 
dashboards, Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32, the record does not support this 
assertion.  In this regard, the agency considered DirectViz’s proposed approach of proposing a “[DELETED]” that will provide “[DELETED],” allowing “[DELETED].”  AR, Tab 63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1 (quoting AR, Tab  33, DirectViz 
Betterment Proposal at  1).  In declining to assess a betterment for this approach, the 
evaluators found that DirectViz’s solution was “currently a requirement under PWS paragraph 3.4.2.6, ” which required “[c] oordination with Web Services personnel to 
develop and maintain visualizations and dashboards in support of operations .”  Id.; 
see AR, Tab  22, PWS §  3.4.2.6.   
 The TEB chair further explains the difference between the offerors’ approaches by stating that DirectViz’s dashboard approach was “limited to a [DELETED], and did not improve response times for incident management standards.”  AR, Tab 83, TEB Chair  Page 22 B-423366 et al.  Decl. at  6.  In contrast, as noted in the contemporaneous evaluation documentation and 
further explained by the TEB chair, Peraton’s proposal “described the implementation of 
a Real -Time Performance Monitor dashboard[]” that went beyond the PWS -required 
[DELETED] to provide “improve[d] response times for incident management standards.”  
Id. at 5; see AR, Tab  62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  Although the protester 
disagrees with the agency’s assessment of the value in improved response times for incident management, Supp. Comments at  35-38, such disagreement alone does not 
establish that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  Accordingly, we find no basis to sustain the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation under this factor.  
 Oral Presentations  
 The protester next asserts that the agency failed to maintain an adequate record of oral presentations.  Specifically, DirectViz contends that the Army failed to document the content of oral presentations such that the record lacks an adequate basis on whi ch to 
assess the agency’s evaluation.  Protest at  58-59; Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest 
at 20-28.  The protester also disagrees with several of the agency’s unfavorable findings 
as noted in the agency’s documented evaluation of DirectViz’s oral presentation.   
Protest at  50-53.  We find the protester’s arguments to be without merit.  
 As an initial matter, in challenging the agency’s documentation of oral presentations, the protester cites to FAR section 15.102(e), which requires agencies to maintain a record 
of oral presentations, and relies in part on our decision in HomeSafe Alliance, LLC , 
B-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  350.  We find, however, that the 
protester’s reliance on that FAR provision and our decision in HomeSafe  is misplaced 
because the procurement at issue here was a task order competition conducted under the procedures of FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task 
order competition under FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less rigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B-421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., 
B-419210, B -419210.2, Dec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 409 at  4-5.   
 Unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted under FAR 
part 15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral presentations 
in task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare 
FAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) 
provides that contracting officers may “exercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures,” “keep submission requirements to a minimum,” and “use streamlined procedures including oral presentations.”  With respect 
to the required documentation in task order competitions, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  
requires agencies  only to “ document in the contract file the rationale for placement and 
price of each order, including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs 
among cost or price and non- cost considerations in making the award decision.”   
 Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government,” and, in fact, the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16;  Page 23 B-423366 et al.  COS/MOL at 62.  The agency instead documented the oral presentations by retaining 
the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the contracting officer and the three TEB 
members, who later convened a panel to prepare a consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  62; see AR, Tab  64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation 
Report; AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Individual Evaluator Notes.
10   
 Based on our review of this record, we find sufficient contemporaneous documentation of the agency’s evaluative judgments of the offerors’ oral presentations.  Moreover, while the evaluators’ notes do not document every aspect of the offerors’ oral 
present ations, they do provide the agency’s documentation of the particular aspects of 
the offerors’ presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluation 
judgments.
11  Where the solicitation specifically advised offerors that the agency may 
not record the oral presentations, we see nothing in the applicable laws or regulations that required the agency to go further and record or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR 
subpart 16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, 
Nov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 365 at 7 (“We see no requirement in law or regulation that an 
agency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart 8.4, and it is not our role to impose one where the FAR does not.”).  
 In addition, while the protester generally challenges every unfavorable finding noted in the evaluation of its oral presentation, we find that the protester’s assertions offer nothing more than its disagreement with the agency’s evaluative judgments.  See 
Protest at  50-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  20-28.  The record shows that the 
agency documented several areas that DirectViz’s presentation did not address before 
ultimately assigning it the highest possible rating of high confidence.  See AR, Tab  64, 
Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 12-16.  Despite asserting that it “disagrees 
with these findings,” the protester does not offer any specific statements to counter the 
agency’s evaluation conclusions other than to generally aver that the protester “believes it fully responded to each oral presentation question and fully addressed every 
 
10 In response to the protester’s complaint that “[m]uch of the evaluators’ notes are 
illegible,” Comments & Supp. Protest at  21, our Office requested that the agency 
provide typed transcriptions of the evaluators’ handwritten notes, and the agency supplemen ted the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  70a(1), 
70b(1), 70c(1), Transcribed Individual Evaluator Notes.  
11 We also reject the protester’s assertion that the documentation is inadequate 
because the content of the evaluators’ notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments & 2nd Supp. 
Protest at  23-27; Supp. Comments at  33.  It is well -settled that, following discussions 
among evaluators, an agency may reach consensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator’s assessment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; 
see e.g. , Unitec Distribution Sys ., B-419874, B -419874.2, Aug. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD 
¶ 307 at  4; Resource Applications, Inc ., B-274943.3, Mar. 5, 1997, 97- 1 CPD ¶ 137 at  5.   Page 24 B-423366 et al.  requirement.”  Protest at  50.  Although the protester faults the agency’s failure to 
sufficiently record the details of the oral presentation and argues that the 
contemporaneous evaluation is unclear and contradictory, the protester does not present any al ternative recollections of the content of its presentation to rebut the 
agency’s documented evaluation.  On this record, we find no basis to fault the agency’s evaluation of DirectViz’s oral presentation.  
 The protester also contends that the agency’s conduct of the oral presentations constituted discussions because, by asking a follow -up question at the end of each oral 
presentation, the agency allowed offerors to revise or add to what was presented, which amounted to allowing revised proposals.  Protest at  51-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. 
Protest at  28-30.  The protester argues that these alleged discussions were misleading 
and not meaningful because the agency asked only one question without affording DirectViz  an opportunity to address other “ostensible gaps in DVS’s oral presentation.”  
Protest at  52.  Based on the record before us, we find no merit to the protester’s 
contention that the agency’s conduct of oral presentations constituted discussions.    As discussed above, the instant task order procurement was conducted under FAR subpart  16.5, and the solicitation specifically warned offerors that “the contracting 
techniques under FAR part 15.3 do not apply” and that “FAR 15.3 procedures will not be utilized to review any subsequent award.”  TOPR at  4.  With respect to oral 
presentations, the solicitation advised that the oral presentation was intended to be “an interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government,” which would be “viewed as a component of the oral presentation itself [that did] not constitute discussions.”  Id. at 17.  The solicitation further stated that the agency “will not ask 
questions that will invite or allow the Offeror to change its Proposal” and prohibited offerors from “volunteer[ing] any information that might be construed as changing its proposal.”  Id. 
 Each of the offerors were asked one follow -up question during oral presentations.  
COS/MOL at 63; see AR, Tab  70d, Contracting Officer’s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.  
The agency asserts that these limited follow -up questions were not discussions 
because they were specifically limited to clarifying the evaluators’ understanding of the solution presented du ring the presentation and did not permit any proposal revisions.  
Supp. COS/MOL at 38-39.  For example, the agency asked DirectViz to “expand upon 
[its] model to deny access to the remaining 550,000 end[ -]user devices for the same 
touch- labor administrators,” thus seeking more information on the model DirectViz 
presented in response to the third oral presentation question.  AR, Tab 70d, Contracting 
Officer’ s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.   
 While the protester argues that this question allowed DirectViz to supplement its oral presentations and thus constituted discussions, the protester does not elaborate on how--or even whether --its response to the follow -up question revised its presented 
solution to the scenario- based oral presentation question.  As the protester points out, 
the consensus evaluation report did not specifically  discuss DirectViz’s response to the 
follow- up question, but instead stated the evaluation conclusion that DirectViz  Page 25 B-423366 et al.  “explained an applicable solution to the problem presented in this question with an 
expert level of understanding of the Entra ID system.”  AR, Tab 64, Oral Presentation 
Final Evaluation Report at  12.  The agency further found that DirectViz “correctly 
identified several key areas such as [DELETED], [DELETED], and [DELETED].”  Id.  
The protester makes no showing--or even allegation--that it provided any information during the question- and-answer portion of the oral presentation that substantively 
revised it s proposed solution or the agency’s evaluation thereof.  On this record, we see 
no basis to conclude that the agency’s carefully limited follow -up question constituted 
discussions.
12  Accordingly, since the agency did not engage in discussions, we 
conclude the protester’s allegation that the agency engaged in misleading discussions is without merit.  
 Cost Evaluations  
 The protester also asserts that the agency’s cost realism analysis failed to consider offerors’ unique technical approaches.  Protest at  64-66; Comments & 2nd Supp. 
Protest at  37-39.  We find no basis to sustain this protest ground.  
 When an agency evaluates proposals for the award of a cost -reimbursement contract or 
task order, it must perform a cost realism analysis to determine the extent to which an offeror’s proposed costs are realistic for the work to be performed.  FAR 15.305(a) (1), 
15.404- 1(d); IAP-C4ISR, LLC, B -421726.2 et al. , Feb.  12, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶  52 at  10.  
An offeror’s costs are not dispositive because, regardless of the costs proposed, the government is bound to pay the contractor its actual and allowable costs.  FAR 16.505(b)(3); 15.305(a)(1); Engility Corp ., B-413120.3 et al., Feb.  14, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 70 at 18.  An agency’s cost realism analysis requires the exercise of informed 
judgment, and we review an agency’s judgment in this area only to see that the analysis was reasonably based and not arbitrary.  Id .  The analysis need not achieve scientific 
certainty; rather, the methodology used must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the agency’s conclusions about the most probable costs for  
an offeror’s proposal are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency at the time of its evaluation.  TeleCommunication 
Sys., Inc ., B-413265, B -413265.2, Sept.  21, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶  266 at  10. 
 In challenging the agency’s cost realism analysis, the protester essentially asserts that the agency’s methodology  was flawed because the Army did not have offerors’ 
technical approaches to compare against their respective cost proposals.  We note, however, that the solicitation did not require the submission of an offeror’s technical 
 
12 We note, at any rate, that even if we were to conclude that the agency’s limited 
follow- up question constituted discussions, the protester does not explain how the 
discussions were misleading or not meaningful.  Specifically, while the protester takes issue with each unfavorable finding noted in the agency’s evaluation of DirectViz’s oral 
presentation, the protester does not explain why the agency was required to raise those findings in discussions when they were not significant enough to prevent the agenc y 
from assigning a high confidence rating to DirectViz’s oral presentation.   Page 26 B-423366 et al.  approach for performing the requirement.  Instead, the non- cost/price portion of offerors’ 
proposals was comprised of prior experience, key personnel resumes, proposed 
betterments, and oral presentations responding to scenario- based problems.  TOPR 
at 9-18.  With respect to the assessment of cost realism, the solicitation set out the 
following specific methodology:  
 
The Government’s objective for cost realism is to utilize Economic Research Institute’s [(ERI)] Salary Assessor tool unburdened hourly rates using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 using Tucson, Arizona locality based on the years of 
experience proposed for that ERI labor category at the 50th Percentile for each Offeror for direct rate [Most Probable Cost] adjustments for evaluation purposes for the Labor Categories specified in Attachment V GCC Cost WorkBook.  Offerors are c autioned that proposing unburdened 
hourly rates less than the 50th Percentile (ERI Survey Mean Hourly Salary) using NAICS 541519 for Tucson, Arizona may be determined high risk on maintaining the current staff; may have a MPC adjustment performed; and/or m ay be determined unrealistic and ineligible based on 
Government discretion.  
 Id. at 21.   
 As an initial matter, we find no merit to the protester’s argument that the oral presentations constituted the offerors’ unique technical approaches that the agency was required to consider in its cost realism analysis.  In this regard, we note that offerors 
were required to prepare their oral presentations “based on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.”  TOPR at  16.  
Although offerors were instructed to “be prepared to discuss their solutions to the questions and problem statements received,” the solicitation did not require offerors to present their technical approaches for performing the overall requirement.  See id.   
Thus, nothing in the solicitation informed offerors that the content of their oral presentations would be considered their unique technical approach upon which the agency would base any cost -realism adjustments made.   
 Moreover, we note that the protester does not challenge the solicitation’s stated methodology of using ERI labor rates for purposes of the cost realism analysis, nor does the protester point to any error in the agency’s extensive cost realism analysis using those rates.  See generally, AR, Tab  56, Cost Evaluation Report.  Instead, the 
protester generally avers that “[i]f the Agency performed the required analysis” of considering offerors’ unique technical approaches, “it likely would have adjusted Peraton’s  proposed costs upward or, alternatively, adjusted [DirectViz’s] proposed costs 
downward, thereby narrowing or eliminating Peraton’s limited 0.3 percent cost advantage.”  Protest at  65.  The protester, however, fails to specifically allege any 
particular aspect of its own--or the awardee’s --unique technical approach that should 
have resulted in an adjustment of proposed costs.  See Protest at 64-66; Comments & 
2nd Supp. Protest at  37-39.  Therefore, we dismiss this ground for failure to state a  Page 27 B-423366 et al.  sufficient factual or legal basis of protest.  4  C.F.R. §  21.5(f) ; see Midwest Tube 
Fabricators, Inc.,  B-407166, B -407167, Nov.  20, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 324 at 3 (explaining 
that our Bid Protest Regulations “contemplate that protesters will provide, at a minimum, 
either allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action”).    In addition, we find that the solicitation clearly advised offerors of the methodology by which the agency planned to evaluate cost realism in the absence of a technical approach submission.  To the extent the protester argues that the agency’s cost realis m 
analysis should have included more--such as requiring the submission of technical approach proposals --we find such arguments to be untimely.  Our Bid Protest 
Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests and our timeliness rules specifically require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation 
that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(1); see Quadrant Training Sols. , JV, B-422339, May  7, 
2024, 2024 CPD ¶  116 at  7.  Since DirectViz did not challenge these terms before the 
initial closing date for proposals, any such challenge now would be untimely.   
 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the agency’s OCI evaluation of Peraton’s proposal was unreasonable.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will only sustain a protest where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving 
the award.  OGSystems, LLC , B-417026 et al., Jan.  22, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶  66 at  18.  
Here, in light of the agency’s unreasonable OCI review, we find that DirectViz has established the requisite competitive prejudice as the offeror next in line for award in the event Peraton is disqualified due to an unmitigated OCI.  
 We recommend that the agency, consistent with our decision, meaningfully consider, evaluate, and document its findings about whether Peraton possesses an OCI arising from its performance of the ARCYBER task order.  In the event the agency identifies an OCI, it should either determine what actions would be appropriate to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the identified OCI, or determine that a waiver of the identified OCI would be 
appropriate.  We also recommend that the protester be reimbursed for its costs of filing 
and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.  4  C.F.R. §  21.8(d).  The  
protester’s certified claims for such costs, detailing the time expended and costs incurred, must be submitted directly to the agency within 60 days after receipt of this decision.  4 C.F.R. §  21.8(f).  
 The protest is sustained.

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest that awardee has disqualifying organizational conflicts of interest is sustained where the record shows that the agency unreasonably concluded there was no possibility of a potential conflict arising from the awardee’s performance of a related task order.  
 2.  Protest challenging agency’s evaluation of proposals is denied where the record shows that the evaluation was reasonable, consistent with the stated evaluation criteria, and adequately documented.  
DECISION  
 DirectViz Solutions, LLC, of Vienna, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) 
No. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information 
technology support services for the Army’s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester 
challenges various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of proposals and award decision, including the agency’s evaluation of Peraton’s organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs).  
 We sustain the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423366 et al.  BACKGROUND  
 
The Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army’s GCC.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 7; Agency  Report (AR), 
Tab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.
1  The 
solicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army’s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services (CHESS- ITESS) multiple -award, 
indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation 
anticipated issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort task order with a 1-
month phase- in period, an 11- month base period of performance, three 1 -year option 
periods, and one additional 6- month option.  Id.  at 2. 
 The task order’s scope of work encompassed “operations and maintenance [] functions, as well as integration of emerging and directed technology adoption” for the Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM), as well as “common service support, capability management support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  
As relevant here, GCC was previously known as the Regional Cyber Center -Continental 
United States (RCC- CONUS), one of five Regional Cyber Cent ers (RCCs) under 
NETCOM.
2  Protest at 1-2; COS/MOL at  3-4.  The solicitation advised that “[t] here is a 
possibility that this follow- on requirement for GCC will not exercise all of the options and 
will merge into a separate competed acquisition for a global, consolidated contract/task order for support across all [ RCCs ].”  TOPR at 1.  In this regard, the solicitation further 
specified that “potential, anticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning [RCC- CONUS] from a[n] RCC to a [GCC] that helps support better 
coordination of digital oper ations across the world.”  TOPR at  1.  The agency states that 
the purpose of the task order is to build a new GCC that will “ultimately replace and 
subsume the work of the standalone RCCs.”   COS/MOL at  3. 
 The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; 
(4) betterment; and (5) cost/price.  TOPR at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost/price 
factors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost/price factors, taken 
together, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation 
of the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign

solicitation are to the final amended version of the TOPR provided in tab 25 of the 
agency report.  Citations to agency report documents are to the internal page numbers marked in the documents; for documents without consecutive page numbers, we cite to 
the Adobe PDF page numbers.  
2 DirectViz was the incumbent contractor for the predecessor task order for 
cybersecurity information technology support services at the RCC -CONUS.   Page 3 B-423366 et al.  confidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the 
agency’s level of confidence that the offeror “ understands the requirement, proposes a 
sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .”  Id.  at 20.  The 
solicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence for any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. 
 The solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 3, 6-18.  Under phase I, 
offerors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  For demonstrated prior experience, 
offerors were required to provide “up to three contracts/orders” performed within the past seven years to demonstrate experience applicable to the PWS for this requirement, specifically “PWS 3.0 Technical Requ irements through 3.6.1.14.2.”  Id. at 10.  The 
TOPR informed offerors that referenced contracts “should be the Offeror’s own experience as a prime or subcontractor” and that “experience from a proposed subcontractor should not be submitted.”  Id.  A detailed narrative was required to 
describe  “how the company’s experience for these contracts/orders in supporting similar 
efforts in size (approximately 300 [full -time equivalents]  supporting 550,000 customers), 
complexity, and scope supporting Federal Government organizations is like this requirement .”  Id.  The solicitation advised that the agency would evaluate offerors’ 
submissions under the experience factor by assessing the government’s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform the requirements.  Id.  at 20. 
 For the key personnel factor, the solicitation required offerors to provide resumes for seven key positions identified in the solicitation that “clearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, 
certifications, and qualifications.”  Id.  at 10-11.  The agency would assess its level of 
confidence that the offeror had identified and committed key personnel with appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications based on, among other things, the “Table 2 
Expert -Level Position Requirements and Table 3 Key Technical Personnel 
Certifications” provided in the PWS.  Id. at 20. 
 Only those offerors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both the experience and key personnel factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.  Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and 
cost/price proposals, and provide oral presentations.  Id. at 11-18.   
 Under the betterment factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose any “betterments,” defined as “any instance where the proposed solution exceeds the Government’s requirement in a way that is meaningful for the Government.”  Id. at 16, 20.  Offerors were instructed to “provide information explaining the promise of the 
betterment and the betterment’s value to the Government.”  Id.  at 16.  The agency 
would then evaluate “the value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate 
cyber space operations across the world and all five of the RCCs.”  Id. at 20. 
  Page 4 B-423366 et al.  For oral presentations, offerors were required to “provide an oral presentation based on 
the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.”  Id. at 16.  Offerors were further informed that they should be “prepared to 
discuss their solutions . . . for Technical Approach and Staffing” to fulfill the government’s requirement.  Id.  As relevant here, the solicitation also stated that oral 
presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government.”  Id.  In addition, the 
solicitation noted that oral presentations were intended to be “an interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government” and that these exchanges would be “viewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute discussions.”  Id. 
at 17.  The agency would “not ask questions that will invite or allow the Offeror to 
change its Proposal” and warned offerors to “not volunteer any information that might be construed as changing its Proposal.”  Id.  Oral presentations would be evaluated by 
assessing the government’s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements “based on the answers provided to the questions provided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.”  Id. at 20.  If an offeror did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral 
presentation, the offeror would not be considered for award.  Id.  at 18.   
 Seven offerors, including DirectViz and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS/MOL at 20.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the 
agency conducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for offerors to update their phase I 
submissions.  Id. at 21; AR, Tab 52, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating 
the updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including DirectViz and 
Peraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II 
proposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  23; AR, Tab 65, Task 
Order Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   
 As relevant here, the agency decided not to record the oral presentations, but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) took contemporaneous notes.  COS/MOL at 23; see AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Evaluators’ Oral Presentation Notes.  
Following the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors’ oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  23; AR, 
Tab 64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1.   
 Following the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of DirectViz and Peraton were assigned the following final ratings:  
 
 DirectViz  Peraton  
Demonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Key Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Oral Presentation  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Betterment s 1 1 
Total Evaluated Cost/Price  $225,833,063  $225,089,343  
 AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.    Page 5 B-423366 et al.   
The contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the PEB’s technical evaluation reports and concurred with its findings.  Id.  at 1, 12.  The 
SSA then conducted a tradeoff analysis of offerors’ proposals under each technical factor and selected Peraton’s proposal for award, finding that DirectViz’s proposal was “not sufficiently more advantageous to the Government to warrant payi ng” the price 
premium of $743,719.  Id.  at 39-40.  The SSA noted that, while the two offerors w ere 
assigned the same ratings of high confidence under each of the first three non-cost/price factors, with one betterment each, Peraton’s proposal provided a better 
value.  Id.  at 40.  Specifically, the SSA found that Peraton demonstrated prior 
experience on contracts with “a larger size, complexity, and scope” and its proposed betterment of automated workflows increased the agency’s confidence that Peraton would provide “except ional value” for transitioning the RCC for the continental United 
States into a GCC.  Id.  Based on these findings, the Army selected Peraton for 
issuance of the task order.  Id. 
 The Army provided a debriefing to DirectViz, and this protest followed.

 DISCUSSION  DirectViz raises numerous challenges to the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  First, the protester contends that Peraton is precluded from award because of unmitigated OCIs.  The protester also asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposal s under each evaluation factor and failed to sufficiently document offerors’ oral 
presentations.  Finally, the protester argues that the agency’s best -value tradeoff 
decision was flawed.   
As detailed below, we find that the agency’s OCI analysis of Peraton was unreasonable 
and sustain the protest on that basis.  We have also considered all of the remaining 
issues raised by DirectViz and, while we do not discuss every argument, we find no additional basis on which to sustain the protest.
4    
 Organizational Conflict of Interest  
 DirectViz contends that the agency failed to meaningfully consider and sufficiently investigate unmitigated OCIs arising from Peraton’s performance under a separate task 
 
3 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this 
protest is within our Office’s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the 
authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
4 In addition, we do not discuss here the protester’s challenges to the agency’s 
best-value tradeoff analysis, which are rendered academic in light of our decision 
sustaining the challenge to the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s OCI.   Page 6 B-423366 et al.  order supporting the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER).5  Protest at  26-32; Comments 
& 2nd Supp. Protest at  46-73.  The protester argues that Peraton improperly failed to 
disclose these conflicts, and that the agency failed to reasonably investigate them.  Id.  
As discussed below, based on our review of the record, we find that the agency failed to 
adequately consider an impaired objectivity OCI arising from Peraton’s work under the ARCYBER task order.  
 The FAR requires contracting officials to identify and evaluate organization conflicts of interests as early as possible, and to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts so as to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the existenc e of conflicting 
roles that might impair a contractor’s objectivity.  FAR 9.504(a), 9.505.  The identification of conflicts of interest is a fact -specific inquiry that requires the exercise of 
considerable discretion.  MANDEX, Inc., B -421664 et al., Aug.  16, 2023, 2023 CPD 
¶ 201 at  5.  To successfully allege a conflict of interest, a protester must identify hard 
facts that indicate the existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough.  AAR Mfg. Inc., d/b/a AAR Mobility Sys ., B-418339, Mar.  17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  106 at  5.  Our Office reviews OCI 
investigations for reasonableness, and where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether a significant conflict of interest exists, we will not substitute our judgment for  the agency’s absent clear evidence that the agency’s conclusion is 
unreasonable.  Inquiries, Inc.,  B-417415.2, Dec.  30, 2019, 2020 CPD ¶  54 at  6. 
  Additional Background 
 As noted above, the awardee will be required to provide cybersecurity information 
technology support services for the GCC.  The scope of the work, as described in the 
PWS, encompasses “operation and maintenance [] functions, as well as [the] integration of emerging and directed technology adoption, . . . common service support, capability 
management support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  The 
wide range of technical support envisioned also includes capability management support for NETCOM and enterprise services division to provide secure operations for the enterprise network infrastructure.  Id. at 3-9.   
 On December 7, 2023, Peraton was awarded a separate Army task order, under the General Services Administration’s (GSA) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated 
 
5 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to consider OCIs arising from 
Peraton’s performance on the predecessor task order to the current ARCYBER task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 73 74.  After reviewing the supplemental agency report,  the protester withdrew its allegation of an impaired objectivity OCI based 
on this predecessor task order but maintained that Peraton had biased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  Supp. Comments at 38 n.9.  For the same reasons discussed herein with respect to the allegations of biased ground rules and unequal access OCIs arising from the ARCYBER task order, we find no merit to these OCI assertions arising from the predecessor task order.   Page 7 B-423366 et al.  Services (OASIS) multiple -award IDIQ contract, to “provide cyberspace operations 
support services for ARCYBER Headquarters[], ARCYBER subordinate components, 
service component partners of USCYBERCOM, and other cyber mission partners.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  1, 8.  The expansive requirements under the 
ARCYBER task order include the provision of:  overarching program management support; intelligence support; cyberspace operations support; planning, strategy, policy, and doctrine support; DODIN mi ssion support; readiness, training, and exercises 
support; and communication and collaboration support.  Id. at 9-50.  Peraton also 
“provide[s] cyberspace operations support,” not only “for ARCYBER Headquarters,” but also for “ARCYBER subordinate components, service component partners of USCYBERCOM, and other cyber mission partners.”  Id. at 8.   
 In explaining the relevant command relationship between ARCYBER and GCC, the GCC task order PWS explains that ARCYBER is the “primary Army headquarters responsible for cyberspace operations in support of Army and Joint requirements” and that it serves as t he single point of contact “for reporting and assessing Army 
cyberspace incidents, events, and operations in Army networks, and for synchronizing and integrating Army responses thereto.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  As a subordinate unit 
to ARCYBER, NETCOM “ plans, engineers, installs, integrates, protects, and operates 
Army Cyberspace, enabling Mission Command through all phases of Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational operations .”  Id.  Under NETCOM, the 7th Signal 
Command is responsible for “delivering seamless, Enterprise- level Army Information 
Technology Portfolio common- user services and operating, managing, and defending 
the Enterprise [information technology] infrastructure in support of the” continental U.S. Army.  Id.  GCC is part of t he 7th Signal Command.  Id.  The GCC PWS further explains 
that “ARCYBER plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, directs, and conducts an integrated defense within all Army networks, and as directed, within the DODIN.”  Id.   
 As relevant here, the solicitation required offerors to “disclose complete information of any work performed by their company that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition or which could result in a potential [OCI].”  TOPR at  9.  An OCI 
mitigation plan was only required if the firm identified an actual or potential OCI.  Id.  
Peraton’s proposal stated that it was “not currently aware of any facts which create any actual or potential [OCI] relating to this opportunity” and thus did not prov ide any OCI 
mitigation plan.  AR, Tab 38, Peraton Proposal General Vol. at  5.   
 Based on DirectViz’s allegations in its initial and second supplemental protests, the contracting officer conducted two rounds of  investigations into potential OCIs arising 
from Peraton’s performance of the ARCYBER task order.   COS/MOL at 27; see 
generally, AR, Tab  71, OCI Determination.   After reviewing relevant documents --
including the PWS of each task order, declarations from the technical lead for the GCC task order and the acquisition chief for the ARCYBER task order, and Peraton’s responses to OCI questionnaires --the contracting officer concluded that no OCIs 
existed.  AR, Tab 71, OCI Determination at  2.  DirectViz disputes this conclusion and 
argues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton’s potential OCIs.  Comments & 2nd Supp.  Protest at 44- 73; Supp. Comments at  48-53.  Page 8 B-423366 et al.    
Impaired Objectivity OCI  
 The protester argues that Peraton has an unmitigated impaired objectivity OCI.
6  Our 
Office has explained that an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm’s ability to 
render impartial advice to the government would be undermined by the firm’s competing interests.  FAR 9.505(a); AT&T Corp ., B-417107.4, July  2, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  283 at  6.  
Here, the protester asserts that an OCI arises from the broad cyber support that Peraton provides to ARCYBER, including support for the GCC, one of ARCYBER’s subordinate components.  Protest at  26-30.  In this regard, the protester points to 
specific provisions in the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton to assist ARCYBER with 
 
6 The protester also alleges that Peraton’s work on the ARCYBER task order also raises 
biased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  A  biased ground rules 
OCI arises where a firm, as part of its performance of a government contract, has in some sense set the ground rules for the competition for another government contract .  
FAR 9.505- 1, 9.505- 2.  In these cases, the primary concern is that the firm could skew 
the competition, whether intentionally or not, in favor of itself.   Systems Made Simple, 
Inc., B-412948.2, July  20, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 207 at 6.  DirectViz, however, does not 
provide any support for its argument that Peraton actually participated in any activity that could have shaped or skewed the requirements for the GCC task order in its favor.  The protester’s inference based on the portions of the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton’s support to develop agency -wide cyber policy and strategy, without more, does 
not constitute the hard facts  required to evidenc e Peraton’s participation in activities 
giving rise to a biased ground rules OCI .  See Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, 
Sept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  332 at  8 (protester s must identify hard facts that show the 
existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough).  
We likewise find no basis to sustain the protester’s allegation of an unequal access to information OCI.  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract.  FAR 9.505(b), 9.505- 4; Cyberdata Techs., Inc. , 
B-411070 et al., May  1, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶  150 at  6.  Other than general conjecture 
about overarching policy and strategic information that Peraton could have encountered 
at planning meetings, DirectViz does not describe any specific information that reasonably constitutes non- public information that could have provided Peraton with a 
competitive advantage.  Moreover, with respect to high- level knowledge of the agency’s 
general priorities, the protester has not shown that such information is beyond the unique information, advantages, and capabilities  that a vendor may possess  due to its 
prior experience under a government contract .  The government is not necessarily 
required to equalize competition to compensate for such normally occurring 
advantages , unless there is evidence of preferential treatment or other improper action.  
See Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, Sept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  332 at  6; CACI, Inc. -
Fed.,  B-403064.2, Jan.  28, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶  31 at  10.    Page 9 B-423366 et al.  shaping overarching cyber policies and plans for its subordinate components, which 
include GCC, creating opportunities for Peraton to influence decisions at the ARCYBER level to benefit Peraton’s work at the GCC.  Id.   The protester also asserts that 
Peraton’s role under the ARCYBER task order allows Peraton to provide biased advice to ARCYBER about deliverables Peraton would provide under the GCC task order.  Id.     
 Based on our review of the record, we agree with the protester that a significant potential conflict  of interest arises from Peraton’s competing roles  under the ARCYBER 
and GCC task orders, which might impair Peraton’s  objectivity  in the performance of its 
obligations under the two task orders.  In this regard, we find that the contracting officer’s conclusions that Peraton is “not authorized to structure policies for the GCC Government personnel on the ARCYBER Task Order” and “does not provide guidance/advice on how the GCC Task Order [contractor] handles its cyber operations,”  
see AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11, are not supported by the record, 
specifically the express terms of the PWS for the respective task orders.    
 For example, the cyberspace operational support task of the ARCYBER task order explains that ARCYBER cyberspace operations “maintain[] Operational Control [] over the RCCs”
7 and “monitor[] and ingest[] information throughout the RCCs and facilitate[] 
information flow directly to the ARCYBER Commander.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  33.  Under this task, however, Peraton as the ARCYBER contractor must 
“assist in cyberspa ce operations planning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing, and 
conducting cyberspace operations and defense of the Army networks,” as well as “develop and maintain [standard operating procedures (SOP)] and [tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)]  pertinent to all cyberspace operations services.”  Id.  Peraton 
must also “[r]eview, assess, and recommend courses of action in response to confirmed, potential threat activity, and unknown/new vulnerabilities.”  Id.  at 35.   
 At the same time, under the GCC task order, Peraton would support “services to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational support services for both the GCC and the Warfighter.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  28.  Within this task, Peraton would be 
requir ed to “perform cybersecurity services to secure DODIN -[Army] information 
systems and networks” as dictated by applicable DOD and Army security policies and procedures, as well as “establish vulnerability management process to identify, classify, prioritize , remediate and/or mitigate, verify, and document existing vulnerabilities to the 
network and information systems.”  Id.   
 These overlapping responsibilities set up an inherent conflict of interest and provide an incentive for Peraton to provide biased advice to the government.  For instance, while Peraton assists ARCYBER to develop SOPs and TTPs that would govern cyberspace 
operations at the GCC, Peraton has an incentive to align these policies and procedures 
with its own capabilities to perform cybersecurity services under the GCC task order.  Moreover, even as Peraton establishes a vulnerability management process for DODIN 
 
7 As explained above, GCC is considered one of the RCCs for the purpose of the 
command relationship with respect to ARCYBER.   Page 10 B-423366 et al.  under the GCC task order, it would be in position to “[r]eview, assess, and recommend 
courses of action in response to . . . vulnerabilities” under the ARCYBER task order, where Peraton would have the opportunity and incentive to favorably assess the vulnerability management process at GCC.  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35. 
 As another example, Peraton is required to “assist in planning, coordinating, and synchronizing DODIN operations” under the ARCYBER task order, which includes the responsibility not only to “architect, build, configure, secure, operate, maintain, and susta in networks and information,” but also to “support mission assurance efforts, to 
include the assessment and implementation of cybersecurity policies [and] programs.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  40.  As part of this effort, Peraton must 
“[c]onduct network and infrastructure plans and assessments  for the adoption and 
implementation of enterprise services, such as cybersecurity” and “[p]rovide weekly updates” on the “status of the implementation plans.”  Id.   
 Under the GCC task order, however, Peraton is responsible for “secur[ing], operat[ing], and maintain[ing]” DODIN’s internet protocol networks in accordance with ARCYBER -
developed policies and programs, and for providing “Operational Oversight” for the “[c]oordination, partnering, and reporting through other DODIN -[Army] service 
providers,” including ARCYBER.  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  4, 17.  Thus, as Peraton carries 
out its duty under the ARCYBER task order to assess and implement cybersecurity policies for DODIN operations, it is in a position to favorably assess and report on 
GCC’s implementation of cybersecurity plans, which have been performed by Peraton under the GCC task order.   
 
A similar conflict arises from Peraton’s duties under the information assurance task of the ARCYBER task order, which include “real -time management and surveillance of the 
Army’s portion of the DODIN,” and require Peraton to “[c]oordinate with . . . RCCs .  . . 
on outages and matters that require escalation to resolve technical deficiencies.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35.  Mirroring this requirement, the GCC task order 
requires the awardee to provide “24/7 operational oversight, support, and maintenance of all GCC- managed services residing on the Army’s . . . portion of the DODIN -[Army],” 
including the responsibility to “track and report incidents/outages as outlined in the established SOPs, policy, and guidance.”  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  16.  The GCC contractor 
is also required to “develop [after action reports] to document the entirety of the issue, response, and remediation from a holistic perspective across the DODIN which is inclusive of all relevant Service Providers (e.g., . . . ARCYBER . . .).”  Id.  Under these 
interrelated tasks, it is seemingly possible for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to be put in the position of determining and reporting on whether an outage incident at the GCC --as managed by Peraton as the GCC contractor --requires 
“escalation to resolve technical deficiencies.”  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order 
at 35.  In such a scenario, Peraton would have both the incentive and the opportunity to 
skew its ARCYBER report to put its work under the GCC task order in the most  
favorable light rather than objectively assessing the effectiveness of its own work.  
  Page 11 B-423366 et al.  The above examples illustrate just a few instances where the interplay between the 
ARCYBER task order and the GCC task order could potentially create an impaired objectivity OCI for a contractor performing on both task orders.  In this regard, our Office has sustained allegations of impaired objectivity OCI where the terms of a previously 
awarded contract or task order would require a contractor to advise the agency on work in which it has a competing interest because of its role in the protested award.  Se e 
MANDEX, Inc., supra at 11-12.   
 In MANDEX, we found that the agency’s determination (that there was no impaired 
objectivity OCI) was unreasonable where the contracting officer failed to consider the full scope of PWS provisions requiring the awardee, performing under a previously awarded task order, to provide input about its work and performance under the protested award.  See id.  In Inquiries, Inc., we sustained an allegation of an impaired 
objectivity OCI where the role of the awardee’s subcontractor under the protested contract would affect its ability to provide unbiased services under a project 
management task order previously awarded to the subcontractor.  See Inquiries, Inc., 
supra at 8-9.  Similarly, here, we find that the plain terms of the two task orders’ 
performance requirements raise a significant potential impaired objectivity OCI, where Peraton’s ability to provide unbiased advice under the ARCYBER task order is impaired by its competing interest as the contractor performing the GCC task order.  
  Inadequate OCI Investigation  
 The protester also argues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton’s OCI because the contracting officer did not examine the work Peraton performs under 
the ARCYBER task order in relation to the work it would perform under the GCC task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  44-46, 62- 70.  Based on our review of the 
record before us, we agree.   
 Despite the contracting officer’s conclusion that no OCI arises from Peraton’s roles under the two task orders, neither of the two OCI determinations show any analysis with respect to the work required to be performed under the PWSs of the respective task orders.  In this regard, although the contracting officer conducted two rounds of OCI investigations based on the protest allegations, neither OCI determination addresses any of the specific sections of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC PWS that the protester cites as potentially giving rise to an impaired objectivity OCI.  See generally,  
AR, Tab  71, OCI Determination; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination.  Instead, the 
contracting officer’s analysis of an impaired objectivity OCI relies entirely on:  (1) conclusory declarations of the contracting officer representative (COR) for the GCC 
task order and an acquisition official for ARCYBER; (2) self -serving statements from 
Peraton that patently conflict with the plain terms of the PWSs; and (3)  the role of 
government officials providing final sign- off on contractor work products.  See AR, 
Tab 71, OCI Determination at  9-10; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11-14.  As 
further discussed below, we find the contracting officer’s reliance on these aspects of its investigation without an independent analysis of the respective PWSs to be unreasonable.   Page 12 B-423366 et al.   
First, the record shows that the declarations provided by the GCC task order COR and the ARCYBER acquisition official were entirely conclusory and, like the contracting officer’s OCI determinations, lacked any analysis of the specific PWS provisions, including those painstakingly enumerated by the protester.  See AR, Tab 71w, Decl. of 
GCC COR at  1-2; AR, Tab 71x, Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-2; AR, Tab  81, 2nd 
Decl. of GCC COR at 1 -3; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-4.  For 
example, both the GCC COR and the ARCYBER Official conclude, without any documented analysis of specific PWS sections, that “ARCYBER does not provide guidance or advice on how the GCC handles its cyber operations . . . . [and] ARCYBER does not dictate how the GCC execute any part of its mission.”  AR, Tab 81, 2nd Decl. 
of GCC COR at 2; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  2.  The contracting 
officer, in his OCI determinations, adopts these conclusory statements without any additional analysis of the work required t o be performed by Peraton under the two task 
orders.  However, as discussed above, the declarants’ conclusory remarks are belied by the ARCYBER PWS provisions requiring Peraton to assist ARCYBER in developing policies and strategies governing the cyber operations at the GCC level, as well as the GCC PWS requiring the GCC contractor to take operational direction from ARCYBER.  Thus, we find unreasonable the contracting officer’s wholesale adoption of these declarants’ conclusory statements without independently analyzing the work required under the two task orders.  
 Second, we also find unreasonable the contracting officer’s reliance on Peraton’s responses to OCI questions where the responses plainly conflicted with the terms of the respective PWS.  In this regard, in responding “No” to the question asking whether 
Peraton “through the ARCYBER task order provide[s] advice about GCC cyber 
operations,” Peraton provided a list of areas where it only provides technical support for “an inherent Governmental function and responsibility performed only by Government personnel.”   Tab 71y, Peraton Responses to OCI Questions at  3-4.  The plain terms of 
the ARCYBER task order, however, list those same tasks as part of the contractor’s responsibility.  For example, Peraton states that “ Government personnel  in ARCYBER 
HQs are responsible for providing intelligence support to the RCCs/GCC and for conducting all -source analysis and production support for full spectrum cyberspace 
operations and planning.”  Id. at 4 (emphasis added).  The ARCYBER PWS, however, 
provides that “[t]he contractor  shall provide all -source intelligence support for the RCCs” 
and “[c]onduct all -source analysis and production support to full spectrum cyberspace 
operations and planning at the RCCs .”  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  25 
(emphasis added).  The contracting officer’s OCI determination relies on the awardee’s 
self-serving responses without meaningfully considering the actual PWS provisions that 
gave rise to the OCI concerns  and, in so doing, fails to note the inconsistenc ies 
between Peraton’s statements a nd the clearly stated PWS requirements under the 
ARCYBER task order .  See AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-14.   
 Third, in light of the contracting officer’s failure to recognize any potential OCI from Peraton’s competing roles under the two task orders --as well as Peraton’s statement 
that it has no OCIs to disclose or mitigate, see AR, Tab  38, Peraton Proposal General  Page 13 B-423366 et al.  Vol. at  5--we find that the OCI concerns here are not mitigated by the contracting 
officer’s general reliance on the role of agency officials.  In this regard, the contracting 
officer explains that “any input received [by GCC] from ARCYBER would be from Government personnel only” and that “even if Peraton did provide support for [the GCC] 
task order, any product that GCC sends to ARCYBER has to be coordinated and approved” by government officials.  AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12.  The 
contracting officer further concludes that, because “Peraton’s advice to GCC would be limited to technical, objective advice reviewed by Government personnel,” it “could not give rise to an opportunity for Peraton to shade that advice to benefit its other contract team .”  Id. at 13.   
 Our Office has explained, however, that the fact that agency officials must approve any recommendations from the contractor does not inherently mitigate the risk that the advice received from the contractor could be biased.  See Inquiries, Inc., supra at  10 
(“We conclude that the contracting officer’s blanket reliance on the requirement that changes must be approved by government personnel does not reasonably show that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to the risk of impaired objectivity  
OCIs.”).  As noted, the purpose of an OCI review is to determine whether a firm’s advice to the government would be impaired by conflicting duties or interests.  AT&T Corp ., 
supra.   Here, as discussed above, the expansive contractor  responsibilities under the 
ARCYBER task order require Peraton to “[p]rovide assistance in the development, inspection, evaluation, and oversight of cybersecurity policies and procedures” for the ARCYBER headquarters and its subordinate components that specifically include the GCC.  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order  at 41.  We conclude that the final approval 
of government personnel for these policies and procedures before they are deployed to 
GCC does not resolve the risk that Peraton’s ability to provide objective advice on such policies and procedures might be impaired by its interest in benefiting Peraton’s work under the GCC task order.  
 Finally, to the extent the contracting officer relied on the fact that the two task orders are administered by two different acquisition offices or the statement that Peraton would not be involved in evaluating contractor performance, we find such reliance to be 
misplaced.  In this regard, the contracting officer concluded that there is no opportunity for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to direct its work under the GCC task order because the ARCYBER task order was issued under GSA’s OASIS IDIQ contract, which was managed by a contracting office separate from the one managing the GCC task order issued under the Army’s CHESS -ITESS IDIQ contract.  
AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-13.  The contracting officer further concluded  
that Peraton would not be evaluating its own work because the evaluation of contractor performance in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) 
will be completed by government personnel without any contractor input or access .  Id. 
at 13-14.   
In light of the circumstances here, we find that both of these lines of inquiry are irrelevant  to determining whether there is an impaired objectivity OCI.  Again, the 
purpose of an impaired objectivity OCI review is to determine whether the firm’s advice to the government  in the performance of the requirements would be impaired by  Page 14 B-423366 et al.  conflicting duties or interests.  Here, the fact that the two task orders were issued under 
different contract vehicles or are administered by different contracting offices has no bearing on whether the ability of the same contractor to render objective services under one task order may be impaired by its competing interest in performing the other task order.  Likewise, when questioning whether the contractor would be evaluating its own work, the concern is not with the evaluation of contractor performance in CPARS, but on whether the contractor, during the performance of its duties under one contract, would be tasked with evaluating or assessing its own product or services provided under a different contract.   
 In sum, we find that the contracting officer unreasonably failed to meaningfully consider whether the work Peraton is required to perform under the terms of the respective PWSs of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC task order would impair Peraton’s ability  to provide objective and unbiased services to the agency.  As discussed above, 
the plain terms of the respective PWSs include several overlapping responsibilities with significant potential for an impaired objectivity OCI in Peraton’s performance of both task orders, yet the contracting officer’s OCI investigation did not address any of these PWS provisions.  In light of this missing analysis, we have no basis to conclude that the OCI determination was reasonable or sufficient .  We therefore sustain the protest on 
this basis.  
 Demonstrated Prior Experience  
 The protester argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals under the demonstrated prior experience factor.  Specifically, the protester contends that the 
agency failed to give sufficient credit for DirectViz’s highly relevant experience under the incumbent task order.  The protester also asserts that the agency improperly credited the awardee’s proposal for the experience of its subsidiary entities.  Based on our review of the record, we find no merit to these arguments.  
 The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc., 
B-419271.5 et al., Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  191 at  7.  In reviewing protests of an 
award in a task order competition, we do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria and applicable 
procurement laws and regulations.  Technatomy Corp.,  B-411583, Sept.  4, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 282 at 4- 5.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation 
judgment, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  
  Protester’s Incumbent Experience  
 The protester first asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to identify additional distinguishing benefits for DirectViz’s demonstrated prior experience as the contractor  Page 15 B-423366 et al.  currently performing the incumbent effort under the predecessor task order.  Protest 
at 33-40.  In this regard, the protester argues that aspects of its highly similar work 
performed on the incumbent effort deserved more recognition in the agency’s evaluat ion 
and best -value tradeoff.  Id.; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  15-16.   
 The agency responds that it evaluated the protester’s experience submission reasonably and in accordance with the solicitation.  Specifically, the agency contends that the protester received the highest possible rating based on its incumbent experience and was not entitled to receive any additional credit.  COS/MOL at  48-50.   
 The record shows that the protester submitted one experience reference in its proposal, describing its incumbent effort on the predecessor task order supporting the Army’s RCC- CONUS.  AR, Tab  27, DirectViz Experience Proposal at  7.  In assigning the 
highes t rating possible, high confidence, the agency noted that DirectViz’s experience 
“demonstrated that it is familiar with the Global Cyber Center [] mission.”  AR, Tab 60, 
DirectViz Experience Evaluation at  1.  The agency also found that DirectViz 
“demonstra ted experience on a contract of similar size and scope with the services 
identified in [PWS] para[graphs] 3.0 to 3.6.1.14.2.”  Id.  In the comparative analysis of 
DirectViz and Peraton’s proposals, however, the SSA noted that while both offerors received the rating of high confidence under the demonstrated prior experience factor, Peraton’s experience under a contract with the Navy’s  Next Generation Enterprise 
Network (NGEN) had “a larger size, complexity, and scope than” the instant requirement.  AR, Tab 65, TODD at  39. 
 On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s 
incumbent experience.  First, our Office has explained that there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  Candor Sols., LLC , 
B-417950.5, B -417950.6, May  10, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  199 at  15.  An offeror’s belief that 
its incumbency status entitles it to higher ratings or additional assessed strengths does not provide a basis for finding that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  See id.  
 In addition, the agency explains that the scope of work under the instant solicitation was anticipated to include work beyond the scope of the incumbent task order.  COS/MOL at 3-5, 48- 49.  In this regard, the solicitation specified that “[a] dditional potential, 
anticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning from a 
RCC to a [GCC] that helps support better coordination of digital operations across the 
world .”  TOPR at  1; see also id. at 16, 20 (requiring proposed betterments to exceed 
requirements in a way that is meaningful for the agency “for transitioning from [a RCC] to a [GCC] that coordinates better digital operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.”).  Based on this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s conclusion that the protester’s incumbent experience did not warrant any extra recognition beyond the assigned rating of high confidence.  
  Awardee’s Affiliate Experience  
  Page 16 B-423366 et al.  The protester also challenges the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s demonstrated 
prior experience, alleging that the agency improperly credited Peraton for the experience of the firm’s affiliate entities.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  6-15.  The 
record shows that Perat on submitted two experience references, both performed by its 
wholly owned subsidiary entities --Peraton Technology Services, Inc. and Peraton 
Enterprise Solutions, LLC.  AR, Tab 39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  The 
protester argues that Peraton’s proposal did not warrant this credit because it did not clearly show these affiliates’ involvement in the performance of the task order.  Id.   The 
agency responds that the solicitation did not prohibit the submission of affiliate experience as an offeror’s own experience and that Peraton’s proposal sufficiently described the commitment of its affiliate resources for performing the instant requi rement.  Supp. COS/MOL at  7-30.  Based on our review of the record, we agree 
with the agency.  
 An agency properly may attribute the experience or past performance of a parent or affiliated company to an offeror where the firm’s proposal demonstrates that the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  Alutiiq Pac., 
LLC, B-409584, B -409584.2, June 18, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶  196 at  4.  The relevant 
consideration is whether the resources of the parent or affiliated company --its workforce, 
management, facilities or other resources --will be provided or relied upon for contr act 
performance such that the parent or affiliate will have meaningful involvement in contract performance.  Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023  CPD ¶ 92.  
 Here, the awardee’s proposal reflects the meaningful involvement of its affiliate entities.  Specifically, Peraton’s demonstrated experience volume explained that Peraton 
“manages its combined business, including all subsidiaries , with a centralized 
leadership structure, consolidated business systems, and common practices, personnel, and other resources to effectively serve multiple government customers worldwide.”  AR, Tab  39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  Moreover, the proposal expressly 
stated as follows:  
 
. . . the personnel, resources, and qualifications offered and committed in this proposal, including those in the corporate experience and past performance citations relied on herein--specifically, ARCYBER [Cyberspace Operations Support] Contract, held by Peraton subsidiary Peraton Technology Services Inc., and NGEN Contract, held by Peraton 
subsidiary Peraton Enterprise Solutions LLC, under its former name, 
Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC --are fully available and attributable to 
Peraton for the successf ul performance of the requirements of this 
solicitation.  
  Page 17 B-423366 et al.  Id.8  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably relied on the stated 
performance commitment of Peraton’s affiliate resources to attribute the experience of 
those affiliated companies to the awardee.    The protester argues that the agency’s arguments in this regard should be disregarded as impermissible post hoc rationalizations because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not include any discussion of Peraton’s affiliate entities.  Supp. Comments at  13-19.  To support its post -protest explanations, the agency submitted a 
declaration from the technical chai r of the PEB stating that the evaluators “reviewed the 
information submitted regarding Peraton’s corporate acquisitions and structure,” and “concluded that Peraton had demonstrated sufficient integration and reliance on the 
affiliates’ resources to treat their experience as the offeror’s own.”  AR, Tab  83, 
Technical Chair Decl. at  2-3. 
 Our Office has explained that, in reviewing an agency’s evaluation, we will not limit our review to contemporaneously documented evidence, but instead will consider all the information provided, including a party’s arguments and explanations.  American Sys. Corp ., B-420132 et al., Dec. 13, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  387 at  10.  Although we generally 
give little or no weight to reevaluations and judgments prepared in the heat of the adversarial process, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed rationale for 
contemporaneous conclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded details, will generally be considered in our review, as long as those explanations are credible and  
consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id.  Here, we find the agency’s post -
protest explanation to be credible and consistent with the contemporaneous evaluation 
record, which does not include any reason to call into question the commitment of these 
affiliate resources in the performance of the t ask order.

8 Since the solicitation did not require a technical approach proposal, Peraton’s 
commitment of its subsidiary resources was provided as part of the demonstrated 
experience volume of its proposal.  
9 DirectViz also contends that it was improper for the agency to consider one of 
Peraton’s two experience references because it was for work performed under an IDIQ contract rather than an individual task order under that contract.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  12-15.  As the agency points out, however, the solicitation required 
offerors to submit “up to three contracts/orders” performed within the past seven years to demonstrate their prior experience and to describe how the firm’s “experience for these contracts/orders in supporting similar efforts” is like the instant requirement.  
Supp. COS/MOL at 25; see TOPR at  10.  The language of the solicitation, therefore, 
permitted offerors to submit references by describing work performed at the IDIQ contract level.  Accordingly, we find no basis to object to the agency’s consideration of Peraton’s experience under an IDIQ contract.   Page 18 B-423366 et al.  Key Personnel Resumes  
 
The protester next argues that the agency erroneously assigned a rating of high confidence to the awardee’s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor when Peraton’s proposed virtualization/cloud computing senior subject matter expert (SME) did not meet the minimum certification requirement.  Protest at  45-47; Comments & 2nd 
Supp. Protest at  16-20.  Specifically, the protester asserts that the solicitation required a 
“VMware Certified Advanced Professional” for this position, but Peraton’s proposed key  
person was only a “VMware Certified Professional.”  Id.  The agency responds that the 
protester mistakenly refers to the requirement for a different position.  In this regard, the Army asserts that the solicitation only required a “VMware Certified Professional” certification (without the “advanced” designation)  for the  proposed virtualization/cloud 
computing senior SME.  COS/MOL at  52-54.   
 The solicitation here required offerors to submit resumes for seven key positions, including a “ Virtualization/Cloud Computing Senior [SME] .”  TOPR at  10.  The solicitation 
advised that submitted resumes “shall clearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications” based on two PWS -provided tables: table 2, expert -level positions 
requirements, and table 3, key technical personnel certifications.  Id.  at 10-11.  The 
virtualization/cloud computing senior SME position only appears on table 3.  AR, Tab 22, 
PWS at  52.  As listed in table 3, the position required a “VMware Certified Professional” 
certification, as well as a number of cloud- related certifications.  Id .   
 On the other hand, table 2, which described “some functional areas [that] require expert 
level expertise,” included the position of a “Virtualization Infrastructure Senior [SME]” among the 16 functional areas/positions.  Id.  at 50-51.  Table 2 specified that the 
visualization infrastructure senior SME be a “VMware Certified Advanced Professional.”  
Id. at 51 (emphasis added).  Although the protester argues that the virtualization 
infrastructure  senior SME in table 2 and the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME 
in table 3 are one and the same key position, the plain reading of the solicitation language does not support this interpretation.  
 Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s actual requirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.  Karthik Consulting, LLC, B -421610.2, May  31, 
2023, 2023  CPD ¶ 134 at  2.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning 
of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; t o be reasonable, and therefore 
valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole 
and in a reasonable manner.  Crew Training Int ’l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb. 7, 2017, 
2017 CPD ¶ 53 at 4.  An ambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations 
of the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible; a patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error.  FFLPro, LLC,  
B-411427.2, Sept.  22, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶  289 at  10.  Where a patent ambiguity is not 
challenged prior to the submission of solicitation responses, we will not consider  Page 19 B-423366 et al.  subsequent untimely arguments asserting the protester’s own interpretation of the 
ambiguous provisions.  Id.  
 As an initial matter, we note that the solicitation here required resumes for seven key personnel positions.  However, table 2 lists 16 (not 7) positions and specifies that these positions are for functional areas that require “expert level expertise.”  AR , Tab 22, PWS 
at 50.  With respect to these positions, the PWS notes that the contractor would be 
required to “retain personnel with management and technical knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience needed to accomplish the performance of work under this task order,” but contains no specific proposal submission requirements.  Id.  The PWS 
also specifically notes that “[s]ome, but not[] all[,] expert -level positions will also be 
identified as key technical positions.”  Id.  Indeed, a review of the two tables shows little 
overlap between the 16 positions listed in table 2 and the 7 “Key Technical Personnel” 
positions listed in table 3.  Compare id.  at 50-51 with id.  at 52.  For example, the 
required key positions of network senior SME and cyber security senior SME are listed among the key personnel positions in table 3 without any directly equivalent positions 
among the expert -level positions in table 2.  Id.  
 Further, the record shows that the two positions --virtualization infrastructure senior SME 
and virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME --have materially different certification 
requirements in addition to the VMware certification.  The virtualization infrastructure senior SME position requires a “[Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)]:  Core Infrastructure” certification , while the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME requires 
a cloud- related certification of “Azure Administrator Associate OR  AWS Certified 
Solutions Architect --Associate . . . OR CompTIA Cloud+” or “MCSE Cloud Platform & 
Infrastructure.”  Id. at 51-52.   
 Reading the solicitation as a whole in a manner that gives effect to these provisions, the only reasonable interpretation is that the virtualization infrastructure senior SME detailed in table 2 and the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME in table 3 are two different 
positions.  Of the two, only the virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME is designated 
as a key person to be evaluated under the key personnel resume factor, and this position requires a VMware certification without the “advanced” designation.  Moreover, even if it was reasonable for the protester to interpret the two positions to be one and the same, solicitation terms providing different certification requirements for the same position would be an obvious or glaring error that constitutes a patent ambiguity, which should have been protested prior to the submission of solicitation responses.  FFLPro, LLC,  supra.   We will not now consider the protester’s untimely arguments asserting its 
own interpretation of the patently ambiguous provisi on.  
 The record here shows --and the protester does not dispute--that Peraton’s resume for 
its proposed virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME had the VMware certified 
professional certification.  See AR, Tab  40, Peraton’s Key Personnel Proposal at  13.  
Accordingly, we find nothing unreasonable in the agency’s finding that the awardee’s proposed virtualization/ cloud computing senior SME satisfied the solicitation’s 
certification requirement.     Page 20 B-423366 et al.  Betterment  
 
The protester next asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to credit DirectViz’s proposal for multiple additional betterments.  Protest at  59-64.  The protester also 
contends that the agency treated offerors disparately by crediting Peraton with a betterment for proposing data- driven dashboards while failing to credit DirectViz for a 
similar aspect of its proposal.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency 
responds that it evaluated the offerors’ proposed betterments in accordance with the solicitation and asserts that the protester’s arguments amount to nothing more than 
disagreement with the agency’s reasonable judgment.  COS/MOL at  73-76; Supp. 
COS/MOL at 39-43.  Based on our review of the record, we agree with the agency.  
 As noted above, the solicitation instructed offerors to propose “betterments,” defined as any instance where the proposed solution exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  TOPR at  16, 20.  Proposed betterments would be evaluated 
for “the value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate cyber space operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.”  Id.  at 20.  In evaluating m ultiple 
betterments listed in DirectViz’s proposal, the agency found that only one of them offered a betterment that exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  See AR, Tab  63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1-2.  While the protester 
claims that all of its proposed betterments deserved credit, the record provides no basis for questioning the agency’s evaluative judgment.  
 For example, the agency declined to find a betterment in the protester’s proposal of a 
centralized service delivery for a global network because “it is currently a requirement under [PWS] paragraph 3.3.3.1.”  Id.  at 1.  The agency supplements this record by 
further explaining that the protester’s description of its centralized service delivery did not meaningfully exceed the cited PWS requirement for the contractor to “perform . . . support functions to remotely operate, monitor, sustain, and secure the Ent erprise 
network within GCC responsibility boundaries.”  AR, Tab 83, Technical Evaluation 
Board (TEB) Chair Decl. at  6; AR, Tab 22, PWS  § 3.3.3.1.  While the protester 
disagrees with this assessment, it does not meaningfully explain how its proposed betterm ent exceeded the PWS requirement.   
   
The protester also asserts that the agency treated DirectViz and Peraton disparately when the agency credited a betterment for Peraton’s proposed dashboard approach while declining to credit a betterment for a similar aspect of DirectViz’s proposal.  Comme nts & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency responds that the difference in 
the evaluation is directly attributable to the differences in the offerors’ proposals.  Supp. COS/MOL at 39-41.   
 It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must treat all  offerors  equally and evaluate proposals  evenhandedly against the solicitation’ s 
requirements and evaluation criteria.  See UltiSat, Inc., B-416809 et al., Dec.  18, 2018, 
2019 CPD ¶ 6 at 9.  Where a protester  alleges unequal treatment in a technical  Page 21 B-423366 et al.  evaluation, it must show that the differences in the evaluation did not stem  from 
differences between the proposals .  See Camber Corp., B -413505, Nov. 10, 2016, 2016 
CPD ¶ 350 at  8.  To prevail on an allegation of disparate treatment, a protester must 
show that the agency  unreasonably downgraded its proposal  for aspects that were 
substantively indistinguishable from, or nearly  identical to, those contained in other 
proposals .  See Battelle Mem'l Inst., B -418047.3, B -418047.4, May  18, 2020,  2020 CPD 
¶ 176 at  5. 
 
Here, the agency found one betterment in each of DirectViz’s and Peraton’s proposals.  See AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.  Peraton’s betterment was assessed for the firm’s 
approach to automated workflows, which “uses the Army’s existing tool suite . . . to create data- driven dashboards that enable the Army to fuse, interpret, and visualize 
large amount s of data.”  AR, Tab 62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  The 
evaluators detailed their rationale for this finding as follows:  
 
As the [GCC] scope of responsibilities grows in breadth and depth, responding to the Army’s information technology needs will become more demanding.  This value- added method provides the GCC with additional 
technical experience in the tool suite identified above in the Offeror’s 
proposal.  Also, the method leans on software tools provided by existing systems of record, such as Army 365, thereby preventing further tools adoption ( i.e. tool bloat).  Employing methods that augment system of 
records, such as Ar my Enterprise Service Management Platform 
(AESMP), will enable the GCC to perform newer obligations more effectively and efficiently.  This is above what is required in the PWS, 
Appendix C, Table 2: Incident Management Standards, (1)  Critical Incident 
Resp onse rates of 94 [percent] within an hour, (2) High-  and medium -
priority incidents exceed response rates of 92 [percent] within 2 core hours and 5 core hours, respectively.  
 Id.     
 While the protester asserts that it also deserved credit for proposing data- driven 
dashboards, Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32, the record does not support this 
assertion.  In this regard, the agency considered DirectViz’s proposed approach of proposing a “[DELETED]” that will provide “[DELETED],” allowing “[DELETED].”  AR, Tab 63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1 (quoting AR, Tab  33, DirectViz 
Betterment Proposal at  1).  In declining to assess a betterment for this approach, the 
evaluators found that DirectViz’s solution was “currently a requirement under PWS paragraph 3.4.2.6, ” which required “[c] oordination with Web Services personnel to 
develop and maintain visualizations and dashboards in support of operations .”  Id.; 
see AR, Tab  22, PWS §  3.4.2.6.   
 The TEB chair further explains the difference between the offerors’ approaches by stating that DirectViz’s dashboard approach was “limited to a [DELETED], and did not improve response times for incident management standards.”  AR, Tab 83, TEB Chair  Page 22 B-423366 et al.  Decl. at  6.  In contrast, as noted in the contemporaneous evaluation documentation and 
further explained by the TEB chair, Peraton’s proposal “described the implementation of 
a Real -Time Performance Monitor dashboard[]” that went beyond the PWS -required 
[DELETED] to provide “improve[d] response times for incident management standards.”  
Id. at 5; see AR, Tab  62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  Although the protester 
disagrees with the agency’s assessment of the value in improved response times for incident management, Supp. Comments at  35-38, such disagreement alone does not 
establish that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  Accordingly, we find no basis to sustain the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation under this factor.  
 Oral Presentations  
 The protester next asserts that the agency failed to maintain an adequate record of oral presentations.  Specifically, DirectViz contends that the Army failed to document the content of oral presentations such that the record lacks an adequate basis on whi ch to 
assess the agency’s evaluation.  Protest at  58-59; Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest 
at 20-28.  The protester also disagrees with several of the agency’s unfavorable findings 
as noted in the agency’s documented evaluation of DirectViz’s oral presentation.   
Protest at  50-53.  We find the protester’s arguments to be without merit.  
 As an initial matter, in challenging the agency’s documentation of oral presentations, the protester cites to FAR section 15.102(e), which requires agencies to maintain a record 
of oral presentations, and relies in part on our decision in HomeSafe Alliance, LLC , 
B-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  350.  We find, however, that the 
protester’s reliance on that FAR provision and our decision in HomeSafe  is misplaced 
because the procurement at issue here was a task order competition conducted under the procedures of FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task 
order competition under FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less rigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B-421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., 
B-419210, B -419210.2, Dec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 409 at  4-5.   
 Unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted under FAR 
part 15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral presentations 
in task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare 
FAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) 
provides that contracting officers may “exercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures,” “keep submission requirements to a minimum,” and “use streamlined procedures including oral presentations.”  With respect 
to the required documentation in task order competitions, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  
requires agencies  only to “ document in the contract file the rationale for placement and 
price of each order, including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs 
among cost or price and non- cost considerations in making the award decision.”   
 Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations “may or may not be recorded by the Government,” and, in fact, the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16;  Page 23 B-423366 et al.  COS/MOL at 62.  The agency instead documented the oral presentations by retaining 
the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the contracting officer and the three TEB 
members, who later convened a panel to prepare a consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS/MOL at  62; see AR, Tab  64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation 
Report; AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Individual Evaluator Notes.
10   
 Based on our review of this record, we find sufficient contemporaneous documentation of the agency’s evaluative judgments of the offerors’ oral presentations.  Moreover, while the evaluators’ notes do not document every aspect of the offerors’ oral 
present ations, they do provide the agency’s documentation of the particular aspects of 
the offerors’ presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluation 
judgments.
11  Where the solicitation specifically advised offerors that the agency may 
not record the oral presentations, we see nothing in the applicable laws or regulations that required the agency to go further and record or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR 
subpart 16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, 
Nov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 365 at 7 (“We see no requirement in law or regulation that an 
agency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart 8.4, and it is not our role to impose one where the FAR does not.”).  
 In addition, while the protester generally challenges every unfavorable finding noted in the evaluation of its oral presentation, we find that the protester’s assertions offer nothing more than its disagreement with the agency’s evaluative judgments.  See 
Protest at  50-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  20-28.  The record shows that the 
agency documented several areas that DirectViz’s presentation did not address before 
ultimately assigning it the highest possible rating of high confidence.  See AR, Tab  64, 
Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 12-16.  Despite asserting that it “disagrees 
with these findings,” the protester does not offer any specific statements to counter the 
agency’s evaluation conclusions other than to generally aver that the protester “believes it fully responded to each oral presentation question and fully addressed every 
 
10 In response to the protester’s complaint that “[m]uch of the evaluators’ notes are 
illegible,” Comments & Supp. Protest at  21, our Office requested that the agency 
provide typed transcriptions of the evaluators’ handwritten notes, and the agency supplemen ted the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  70a(1), 
70b(1), 70c(1), Transcribed Individual Evaluator Notes.  
11 We also reject the protester’s assertion that the documentation is inadequate 
because the content of the evaluators’ notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments & 2nd Supp. 
Protest at  23-27; Supp. Comments at  33.  It is well -settled that, following discussions 
among evaluators, an agency may reach consensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator’s assessment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; 
see e.g. , Unitec Distribution Sys ., B-419874, B -419874.2, Aug. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD 
¶ 307 at  4; Resource Applications, Inc ., B-274943.3, Mar. 5, 1997, 97- 1 CPD ¶ 137 at  5.   Page 24 B-423366 et al.  requirement.”  Protest at  50.  Although the protester faults the agency’s failure to 
sufficiently record the details of the oral presentation and argues that the 
contemporaneous evaluation is unclear and contradictory, the protester does not present any al ternative recollections of the content of its presentation to rebut the 
agency’s documented evaluation.  On this record, we find no basis to fault the agency’s evaluation of DirectViz’s oral presentation.  
 The protester also contends that the agency’s conduct of the oral presentations constituted discussions because, by asking a follow -up question at the end of each oral 
presentation, the agency allowed offerors to revise or add to what was presented, which amounted to allowing revised proposals.  Protest at  51-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. 
Protest at  28-30.  The protester argues that these alleged discussions were misleading 
and not meaningful because the agency asked only one question without affording DirectViz  an opportunity to address other “ostensible gaps in DVS’s oral presentation.”  
Protest at  52.  Based on the record before us, we find no merit to the protester’s 
contention that the agency’s conduct of oral presentations constituted discussions.    As discussed above, the instant task order procurement was conducted under FAR subpart  16.5, and the solicitation specifically warned offerors that “the contracting 
techniques under FAR part 15.3 do not apply” and that “FAR 15.3 procedures will not be utilized to review any subsequent award.”  TOPR at  4.  With respect to oral 
presentations, the solicitation advised that the oral presentation was intended to be “an interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government,” which would be “viewed as a component of the oral presentation itself [that did] not constitute discussions.”  Id. at 17.  The solicitation further stated that the agency “will not ask 
questions that will invite or allow the Offeror to change its Proposal” and prohibited offerors from “volunteer[ing] any information that might be construed as changing its proposal.”  Id. 
 Each of the offerors were asked one follow -up question during oral presentations.  
COS/MOL at 63; see AR, Tab  70d, Contracting Officer’s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.  
The agency asserts that these limited follow -up questions were not discussions 
because they were specifically limited to clarifying the evaluators’ understanding of the solution presented du ring the presentation and did not permit any proposal revisions.  
Supp. COS/MOL at 38-39.  For example, the agency asked DirectViz to “expand upon 
[its] model to deny access to the remaining 550,000 end[ -]user devices for the same 
touch- labor administrators,” thus seeking more information on the model DirectViz 
presented in response to the third oral presentation question.  AR, Tab 70d, Contracting 
Officer’ s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.   
 While the protester argues that this question allowed DirectViz to supplement its oral presentations and thus constituted discussions, the protester does not elaborate on how--or even whether --its response to the follow -up question revised its presented 
solution to the scenario- based oral presentation question.  As the protester points out, 
the consensus evaluation report did not specifically  discuss DirectViz’s response to the 
follow- up question, but instead stated the evaluation conclusion that DirectViz  Page 25 B-423366 et al.  “explained an applicable solution to the problem presented in this question with an 
expert level of understanding of the Entra ID system.”  AR, Tab 64, Oral Presentation 
Final Evaluation Report at  12.  The agency further found that DirectViz “correctly 
identified several key areas such as [DELETED], [DELETED], and [DELETED].”  Id.  
The protester makes no showing--or even allegation--that it provided any information during the question- and-answer portion of the oral presentation that substantively 
revised it s proposed solution or the agency’s evaluation thereof.  On this record, we see 
no basis to conclude that the agency’s carefully limited follow -up question constituted 
discussions.
12  Accordingly, since the agency did not engage in discussions, we 
conclude the protester’s allegation that the agency engaged in misleading discussions is without merit.  
 Cost Evaluations  
 The protester also asserts that the agency’s cost realism analysis failed to consider offerors’ unique technical approaches.  Protest at  64-66; Comments & 2nd Supp. 
Protest at  37-39.  We find no basis to sustain this protest ground.  
 When an agency evaluates proposals for the award of a cost -reimbursement contract or 
task order, it must perform a cost realism analysis to determine the extent to which an offeror’s proposed costs are realistic for the work to be performed.  FAR 15.305(a) (1), 
15.404- 1(d); IAP-C4ISR, LLC, B -421726.2 et al. , Feb.  12, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶  52 at  10.  
An offeror’s costs are not dispositive because, regardless of the costs proposed, the government is bound to pay the contractor its actual and allowable costs.  FAR 16.505(b)(3); 15.305(a)(1); Engility Corp ., B-413120.3 et al., Feb.  14, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 70 at 18.  An agency’s cost realism analysis requires the exercise of informed 
judgment, and we review an agency’s judgment in this area only to see that the analysis was reasonably based and not arbitrary.  Id .  The analysis need not achieve scientific 
certainty; rather, the methodology used must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the agency’s conclusions about the most probable costs for  
an offeror’s proposal are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency at the time of its evaluation.  TeleCommunication 
Sys., Inc ., B-413265, B -413265.2, Sept.  21, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶  266 at  10. 
 In challenging the agency’s cost realism analysis, the protester essentially asserts that the agency’s methodology  was flawed because the Army did not have offerors’ 
technical approaches to compare against their respective cost proposals.  We note, however, that the solicitation did not require the submission of an offeror’s technical 
 
12 We note, at any rate, that even if we were to conclude that the agency’s limited 
follow- up question constituted discussions, the protester does not explain how the 
discussions were misleading or not meaningful.  Specifically, while the protester takes issue with each unfavorable finding noted in the agency’s evaluation of DirectViz’s oral 
presentation, the protester does not explain why the agency was required to raise those findings in discussions when they were not significant enough to prevent the agenc y 
from assigning a high confidence rating to DirectViz’s oral presentation.   Page 26 B-423366 et al.  approach for performing the requirement.  Instead, the non- cost/price portion of offerors’ 
proposals was comprised of prior experience, key personnel resumes, proposed 
betterments, and oral presentations responding to scenario- based problems.  TOPR 
at 9-18.  With respect to the assessment of cost realism, the solicitation set out the 
following specific methodology:  
 
The Government’s objective for cost realism is to utilize Economic Research Institute’s [(ERI)] Salary Assessor tool unburdened hourly rates using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 using Tucson, Arizona locality based on the years of 
experience proposed for that ERI labor category at the 50th Percentile for each Offeror for direct rate [Most Probable Cost] adjustments for evaluation purposes for the Labor Categories specified in Attachment V GCC Cost WorkBook.  Offerors are c autioned that proposing unburdened 
hourly rates less than the 50th Percentile (ERI Survey Mean Hourly Salary) using NAICS 541519 for Tucson, Arizona may be determined high risk on maintaining the current staff; may have a MPC adjustment performed; and/or m ay be determined unrealistic and ineligible based on 
Government discretion.  
 Id. at 21.   
 As an initial matter, we find no merit to the protester’s argument that the oral presentations constituted the offerors’ unique technical approaches that the agency was required to consider in its cost realism analysis.  In this regard, we note that offerors 
were required to prepare their oral presentations “based on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.”  TOPR at  16.  
Although offerors were instructed to “be prepared to discuss their solutions to the questions and problem statements received,” the solicitation did not require offerors to present their technical approaches for performing the overall requirement.  See id.   
Thus, nothing in the solicitation informed offerors that the content of their oral presentations would be considered their unique technical approach upon which the agency would base any cost -realism adjustments made.   
 Moreover, we note that the protester does not challenge the solicitation’s stated methodology of using ERI labor rates for purposes of the cost realism analysis, nor does the protester point to any error in the agency’s extensive cost realism analysis using those rates.  See generally, AR, Tab  56, Cost Evaluation Report.  Instead, the 
protester generally avers that “[i]f the Agency performed the required analysis” of considering offerors’ unique technical approaches, “it likely would have adjusted Peraton’s  proposed costs upward or, alternatively, adjusted [DirectViz’s] proposed costs 
downward, thereby narrowing or eliminating Peraton’s limited 0.3 percent cost advantage.”  Protest at  65.  The protester, however, fails to specifically allege any 
particular aspect of its own--or the awardee’s --unique technical approach that should 
have resulted in an adjustment of proposed costs.  See Protest at 64-66; Comments & 
2nd Supp. Protest at  37-39.  Therefore, we dismiss this ground for failure to state a  Page 27 B-423366 et al.  sufficient factual or legal basis of protest.  4  C.F.R. §  21.5(f) ; see Midwest Tube 
Fabricators, Inc.,  B-407166, B -407167, Nov.  20, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 324 at 3 (explaining 
that our Bid Protest Regulations “contemplate that protesters will provide, at a minimum, 
either allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action”).    In addition, we find that the solicitation clearly advised offerors of the methodology by which the agency planned to evaluate cost realism in the absence of a technical approach submission.  To the extent the protester argues that the agency’s cost realis m 
analysis should have included more--such as requiring the submission of technical approach proposals --we find such arguments to be untimely.  Our Bid Protest 
Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests and our timeliness rules specifically require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation 
that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(1); see Quadrant Training Sols. , JV, B-422339, May  7, 
2024, 2024 CPD ¶  116 at  7.  Since DirectViz did not challenge these terms before the 
initial closing date for proposals, any such challenge now would be untimely.   
 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the agency’s OCI evaluation of Peraton’s proposal was unreasonable.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will only sustain a protest where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving 
the award.  OGSystems, LLC , B-417026 et al., Jan.  22, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶  66 at  18.  
Here, in light of the agency’s unreasonable OCI review, we find that DirectViz has established the requisite competitive prejudice as the offeror next in line for award in the event Peraton is disqualified due to an unmitigated OCI.  
 We recommend that the agency, consistent with our decision, meaningfully consider, evaluate, and document its findings about whether Peraton possesses an OCI arising from its performance of the ARCYBER task order.  In the event the agency identifies an OCI, it should either determine what actions would be appropriate to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the identified OCI, or determine that a waiver of the identified OCI would be 
appropriate.  We also recommend that the protester be reimbursed for its costs of filing 
and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.  4  C.F.R. §  21.8(d).  The  
protester’s certified claims for such costs, detailing the time expended and costs incurred, must be submitted directly to the agency within 60 days after receipt of this decision.  4 C.F.R. §  21.8(f).  
 The protest is sustained.

DECISION  
K
ako’o Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, LLC (KSHS), a small business of Honolulu, 
Hawaii, protests the award of a contract to Cognito Systems, LLC, a small business of 
Newport News, Virginia, under request for proposals (RFP) No. M00264- 22-R- 0008, 
issued by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) for the services of certified athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists for the USMC’s sports medicine and injury program (SMIP).  The protester primarily asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
  Page 2 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   
We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The RFP, issued on August 2, 2022, sought to procure the services of certified athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists for the USMC’s SMIP.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP amend. 0005, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at ¶¶ 1.2- 1.3.  
SMIP was created to reduce injuries and lost workdays caused by musculoskeletal 
injuries.  Id.   The RFP anticipates that the trainers and specialists will provide state- of-
the art professional services to assist injured marines and accelerate their return to duty.  Id. 
 The RFP, set aside for small businesses, contemplated the award of a fixed- price 
indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract to be performed over five 1- year ordering 
periods, with the option to extend the contract for an additional six months.  AR, Tab 1, RFP at 73.  Award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value to the government based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  management and staffing approach, past performance, and price.  RFP  
amend. 0005 at 17- 20.  Offerors were to submit their proposals in four volumes, each 
with its own page limit.  The volume for management and staffing approach, the only factor at issue here, had a 50- page limit.  Id . at 14.   
 Under the management and staffing approach factor, the agency would evaluate each offeror’s approach to meeting the PWS requirements.  Specifically, the agency would 
evaluate the offeror’s experience in managing similar programs and how the offeror would provide continuous, quality, and timely support.  The agency would also evaluate the offeror’s plan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists.  This plan was to include an approach to mitigating competition from other firms seeking to hire the trainers and specialists.  Finally, the agency would 
evaluate the offeror’s operational plan for effective communication between the government and the offeror’s employees.  RFP amend. 0005 at 19.  Under this factor, the agency would assign a rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or 
unacceptable.  Id . at 18.   
 The USMC received proposals from 11 vendors, including KSHS, the incumbent contractor, and Cognito.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 7.  In September 2024, the agency conducted discussions with offerors and reevaluated pr oposals, including the technical and past performance volumes.  Id. 
at 8.  In its discussions letter to Cognito, the agency informed the firm that its management and staffing approach volume had been assigned three strengths and three weaknesses.  The agency also asked Cognito to respond to three questions.  AR, Tab 26, Cognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2.  Cognito responded to the questions in a 
document submitted as its final proposal revision (FPR).  AR, Tab 11, Cognito’s FPR.  The agency determined that C ognito’s management and staffing approach volume no 
longer had any weaknesses.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.  This round of  Page 3 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations yielded the final ratings for the technical and past performance volumes.  
COS/MOL at 8.  The agency made award to Cognito on November 14.  Id .   
 On December 2, KSHS filed a protest with our Office challenging the award, asserting that the USMC misevaluated proposals, conducted misleading discussions, unreasonably failed to find that Cognito was not a responsible contractor, and made an unreasonable source selection decision.  Kako’o Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, LLC, B-421127.2, Jan. 6, 2025 (unpublished decision) at 1.  The agency chose to take 
corrective action, stating that it would review the evaluations and make a new source selection decision.  Id.  As a result of the agency’s proposed corrective action, we 
dismissed the protest as academic on January 6, 2025.  Id .   
 As part of the agency’s corrective action, KSHS and Cognito were both invited to update their price volumes, but only KSHS submitted an updated price volume.  COS/MOL at 9.  The agency’s finalized evaluation included the technical and past performance rati ngs 
from September 2024, and the reevaluation of KSHS’s updated price from February 2025.  The final ratings were as follows:  
 
 KSHS  Cognito  
Management and Staffing Approach  Good  Outstanding  
Past Performance  Satisfactory  Satisfactory  
Price  $63,869,786  $61,288,781  
 AR, Tab 22, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 2.   
 
The agency made various findings and determinations for both proposals under the 
management and staffing approach factor.  The agency determined that KSHS’s proposal demonstrated a thorough approach to meeting the PWS requirements and a thorough understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id . at 3.  The agency 
assigned KSHS’s proposal one strength for its experience under the incumbent contract and assigned the KSHS proposal an overall rating of good.  Id .  
 The agency determined that Cognito’s proposal demonstrated an exceptional approach to meeting the PWS requirements and an exceptional understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id.  The agency assigned Cognito’s proposal three strengths.  One 
strength was assigned for the firm’s proposed [ DELETED] and another strength was 
assigned for Cognito’s experience staffing similar efforts for other Department of Defense organizations.  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency assigned a third strength for Cognito’s 
proposed [DELETED].   Id.  The agency assigned Cognito’s proposal an overall rating of 
outstanding.  Id. at 3.   
 Regarding past performance, the agency determined that it had reasonable confidence that both offerors would successfully perform the contract.  Id .  The agency further 
noted that both offeror’s prices were fair and reasonable.  Id.  In comparing the two 
proposals, the agency noted that Cognito’s proposal was superior to KSHS’s proposal under the management and staffing approach factor because it provided benefits that  Page 4 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  KSHS’s proposal did not.  Id. at 5.  Considering all this, the agency noted that the 
management and staffing approach factor was significantly more important than past 
performance and price, and that the first two factors were significantly more important than price when combined.  A s a result the agency determined that Cognito’s proposal 
was the best value for the agency because of its superior technical approach and 4.2 percent lower price.  Id.  On February 5, the agency made award to Cognito and notified 
KSHS the same day.  COS/MOL at 12.  KSHS subsequently received a debriefing, and this protest followed.    DISCUSSION  KSHS raises several challenges to the evaluation of proposals under the management and staffing approach factor.  We have considered them all and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that in reviewing protests challenging an agency ’s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate 
proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the 
solicitation ’s evaluation criteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.   Kupono

 Evaluation of Cognito’s Proposal  
 KSHS asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito’s management and staffing approach volume by improperly considering portions of the proposal that exceeded the page limits.  Supp. Comments at 2- 10.  KSHS first points to Cognito’s 
original propos al and asserts that it exceeded the page limit by one page and argues 
that this one page included information that informed part of the agency’s evaluation.  KSHS contends that, had the agency properly ignored this information in accordance with the page l imit requirements, Cognito would have received a lower rating and KSHS 
would likely have received award.  Id . at 2 -7.  KSHS next points to Cognito’s FPR and 
asserts that it also exceeded the page limits.  KSHS contends that Cognito supplied its revisions in a document separate from its original proposal and did not incorporate them into its original proposal, therefore including an additional six pages that exceeded the page limits.  Id . at 7 -9.  KSHS argues that Cognito’s FPR was what the agency relied on 
in assigning Cognito a rating of outstanding as its FPR cured the three weaknesses the agency had previously assigned.  KSHS contends that had the agency properly ignored Cognito’s FPR as exceeding the page limits, Cognito would have received a lower technical rating.  Id .  
 The USMC responds that, even if it improperly considered the additional pages in both Cognito’s original proposal and its FPR, then the agency essentially waived the page limit requirements and KSHS was not prejudiced by the waiver.  The agency contends that KSHS was not prejudiced because KSHS’s management and staffing approach 
volume was 20 pages below the page limit.  As a result, the agency argues, KSHS cannot show that it would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements by adding five extra  Page 5 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages to its proposal because it chose to submit a proposal that was already 20 pages 
under the limit.  Supp. MOL at 6- 7, 12 -13.   
 The protester responds that this standard of prejudice is inapplicable.  KSHS argues that the proper standard of prejudice is that had the agency excluded the extra pages, Cognito would not have been next in line for award and KSHS would likely have receiv ed the award, and therefore KSHS was competitively prejudiced.  Supp. 
Comments at 9- 10.  
 While we agree that the agency effectively waived the solicitation’s 50- page limit for the 
management and staffing approach volume in evaluating Cognito’s proposal, we find that the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency’s waiver .  In 
general, offerors must prepare their proposals within the format limitations set out in an agency ’s solicitation, including any applicable page limits.  DynCorp Int’l LLC , 
B-411126.4, et al. , Dec. 20, 2016, 2017 CPD ¶ 333 at 14.  Offerors that exceed a 
solicitation ’s established page limitations assume the risk that the agency will not 
consider the excess pages.  Id.  However, an agency may waive compliance with a 
material solicitation requirement, such as page limitations, in awarding a contract if the award will meet the agency’s actual needs without prejudice to other offerors.  DRS Network & Imaging Sys., LLC , B-413409, B -413409.2, Oct. 25, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 315 
at 9; LASEOD Group, LLC , B-405888, Jan. 10, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 45 at 5.  
 The solicitation required that offerors submit management and staffing approach volumes that were no more than 50 pages in length.  RFP amend. 0005 at 14.  Cognito’s original management and staffing approach volume is 51 pages long based 
on the Adobe PDF pagination, which includes every page in the volume, starting with the cover page.  AR, Tab 8.1, Cognito’s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1-51.  Based on the Adobe PDF pagination, page 1 of the volume is the cover page with 
no substantive inform ation on it and page 51 of the volume includes some substantive 
information of Cognito’s approach.  Id. at 1, 51.   
 Cognito’s response to the discussions letter, submitted as its FPR, consists of six pages in total according to the Adobe PDF pagination.  Four of these pages include Cognito’s response to the three questions raised by the agency.  AR, Tab 11, Cognito’s Fi nal 
Proposal Revisions at 2- 5.  Cognito’s response does not state that these pages replace 
pages in its original proposal, and Cognito did not submit a revised proposal including these new pages, but rather submitted these pages in response to the discussi ons 
letter.  Id. at 1.  The solicitation did not provide any information regarding page 
limitations for FPRs.  Additionally, while the discussions letters stated that responses would be “incorporated into [offerors’] Final Proposal Revisions,” the discussions letters did not state that revisions were not subject to the solicitation’s page limits.  AR, Tab 26, 
Cognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2. 
 As a result, based on our review of the record, we conclude that the agency effectively waived the management and staffing approach volume page limit of 50 pages for Cognito’s original proposal and its FPR.  The agency allowed Cognito an additional five  Page 6 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages in total beyond the limit –  1 from its original proposal, and 4 from its FPR, 
effectively waiving the requirement regarding page limitations.  However, this wavier 
does not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; and where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  DRS, supra  at 10.  In this regard, even where an 
agency waives a material solicitation requirement, our Office will not sustain the protest unless the protester can demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the waiver,  i.e., where 
the protester would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements.  Id.; Cerner Corp. , 
B-293093, B -293093.2, Feb. 2, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 34 at 7 n. 7.  In cases where the 
protester argues that an agency waived a certain requirement, prejudice does not mean that, had the agency failed to waive the requirement, the awardee would have been unsuc cessful.  LASEOD, supra.  Rather, the pertinent question is whether the prot ester 
would have submitted a different offer that would have had a reasonable possibility of being selected for award had it known that the requirement would be waived.  Id . 
 KSHS’s original management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages based on the Adobe PDF pagination.  AR, Tab 5.1, KSHS’s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1- 31.  Its FPR only affected its price volume, which had no page limitations.  
RFP amend. 0005 at 14; AR, Tab 25, KSHS Discussions Letter at 1.  As a result, KSHS’s final page count for its management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages, which is 19 pages below the 50- page limit.  In order for KSHS to be prejudiced 
by the agency’s waive r of page limits for the management and staffing approach 
volume, KSHS would have needed to demonstrate how it would have altered its volume to its competitive advantage had it been aware that it could use an additional five pages.  As KSHS’s volume is 19 pages below the limit, KSHS has not argued and cannot show it would have made use of an additional five pages to its competitive advantage.  Thus, the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency’s waiver, and we deny this aspect of KS HS’s protest.  Cerner, supra; LASEOD, supra . 
 KSHS next argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito’s management and staffing approach volume because it did not document whether Cognito’s approach to locating, recruiting, and retaining athletic trainers met the solicitation’s requirements.  KSHS also argues that even if the USMC had documented this aspect of the proposal, its conclusion that Cognito’s approach met this requirement is unreasonable because Cognito is using the same approach that was negatively rated in one of its past performance references.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8; Supp. Comments at 10- 12.   
 The USMC responds that the record is sufficiently documented because it conducted its evaluation in accordance with the RFP’s terms, and specifically noted any strengths, weaknesses, and significant weaknesses, and the rationale for them.  Supp. MOL at 14.   
The agency further asserts that it was not required to document proposal content that simply met criteria as agencies are not required to document every detail of their  Page 7 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations.  The agency also contends that KSHS has not argued or demonstrated that 
Cognito’s technical volume does not meet the requirement regarding recruitment and retainer, but rather argues only that the agency should have evaluated Cognito’s proposal in a manner inconsistent with the solicitation criteria– that is, by considering 
past performance ratings in the technical evaluation.  Id . at 15- 16.  
 We find that the record is sufficiently documented.  While an agency ’s evaluation 
judgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show it is not arbitrary, a failure to discuss every detail regarding the relative merit of a proposal in an evaluation decision document does not affect the validity of the evaluation.  Artek Constr. Co., B -418657, 
B-418657.2, July 17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 285 at 9 n.14 (denying protester’s argument 
that the agency failed to document its evaluation where the evaluation did not detail why a portion of the protester’s proposal was inadequate because agencies are not required to discuss every detail of the relative merit of a proposal).  Additionally, as noted below, post-protest explanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be 
considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id. 
 The RFP required that offerors provide a “plan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength conditioning coaches who meet or exceed the minimum standards.”  RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  In its technical evaluations, the agency noted strengt hs and weaknesses and cited to the portions of proposals supporting those 
assessments.  The agency also included a paragraph summarizing its findings for each proposal.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 4- 13.  The agency only notes portions 
of proposal s that merited strengths or demonstrated weaknesses and did not take note 
of portions that simply met requirements.  Supp. COS/MOL at 4, 14.   
 Regarding Cognito’s proposal, the agency noted the portions that merited strengths and displayed weaknesses.
1  The agency summarized its view of Cognito’s proposal in a 
paragraph, noting that it had an exceptional understanding of the requirements, excellent experience, and the agency expected Cognito could successfully perform the contract.  AR, Tab 17, Technica l Evaluations at 4- 7.  During the development of the 
protest, the agency supplied additional statements from the contracting officer and the technical evaluation team (TET) chair to support these findings.  Again, post -protest 
explanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  The contracting officer explains that the TET was to review the entirety of each proposal, but only document portions that 
exceeded the requirements or failed to meet them.  Supp. COS/MOL at 3- 4.  The 
contracting officer also states that the absence of any discussion about a particular requirement meant the offeror’s proposal met that requirement.  Id. at 4.  The TET chair 
also states that if a proposal met a requirement but did not exceed it, the TET did not note it.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.   
 
1 The technical evaluation notes how these weaknesses were cured following FPRs.  
AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.    Page 8 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   
Here, the record shows that the agency considered the contents of each proposal and documented its evaluation.  In this regard, the agency’s post -protest conclusions are 
reasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  The protester is incorrect that  the 
agency failed to document its evaluation simply because it utilized a methodology of documenting only the portions of proposals that exceeded or failed to meet requirements and making no notations on portions that met requirements.  As a result, the protester has not shown that the agency failed to document its findings.  Konica Minolta Bus. Sols. USA, Inc. , B-418800, B -418800.2, Sep. 4, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 292 at 
6 n.4 (explaining that the agency’s choice not to document all determinations of adequacy did not render the evaluation unreasonable or inadequately documented).   
In addition, we are not persuaded by the protester’s argument that the agency should have considered Cognito’s past performance information as part of its technical evaluation.  The RFP did not require such consideration, and the protester does not identif y any portion of the RFP that supports its argument.   
 Evaluation of KSHS’s Proposal  
 KSHS argues that the agency should have assigned its management and staffing approach volume six additional strengths.  We have reviewed all KSHS’s arguments and find that it has not demonstrated that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretio n not to assign additional strengths.  We address three examples below.    
 KSHS first asserts that its proposal should have been assigned a strength for its “unparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its 
experienced [human performance] program manager.”  Supp. Comments at 14.  The agency responds that KSHS already received a strength for its experience, and there was no reason to assign an additional strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.  The protester counters that the agency did not address its program manager’s 
experience specifi cally, which merited a strength by itself, and therefore the agency has 
conceded this issue.  Supp. Comments at 14.   
 We are not persuaded.  The agency’s response addressed KSHS’s experience as the incumbent contractor, which would extend to its program manager’s experience.  Compare Comments & Supp. Protest at 9 (asserting that the protester’s proposal 
exceeded requirements with “unparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its experienced [human performance] program manager”) with  AR, 
Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1 (stating that “KSHS was provided a strength for experience. This proposal feature addresses incumbency and experience . . . on the previous SMIP contract.  No additional strength was distinguished in this proposed feature.”).    Second, the protester’s argument rests on a misunderstanding of the standard we apply when determining whether an agency reasonably exercised its discretion not to assign a strength.  The protester implies that because its experience exceeded the requirements, it is necessarily entitled to a strength.  This is incorrect.  A n agency ’s judgment of  Page 9 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  whether to assess unique strengths is a matter within the agency ’s discretion and one 
that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the evaluation 
was unreasonable.   APC Constr., LLC, B -419771, July 13, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 258 at 8.  
It is up to the agency to determine whether an offering, even one that exceeds the requirements, merits a strength so long as the agency’s decision has a reasonable basis.  The protester does not challenge t he agency’s assertion that its experience was 
already accounted for and neither does the protester demonstrate how the agency’s decision not to assign a strength was unreasonable.  As a result, the protester’s argument amounts to disagreement with the agency’s decision which does not provide a basis  to sustain the protest.  APC, supra  at 10; The Ginn Group., Inc. , B-420165, 
B-420165.2, Dec. 22, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 17 at 9.   
 KSHS next asserts that it should have received a strength for proposing an “uninterrupted transition in 15 days or less” at the start of contract performance.  Supp. Comments at 15.  The agency responds that this offering did not merit a strength because t he awardee is required to commence performance on the performance start 
date, and the agency viewed this offering as KSHS simply affirming that it would meet the requirement.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  The protester responds that its transition timeline is nevertheless clearly a benefit to the agency.  Supp. Comments at 15.  KSHS has not demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  The firm’s response that this offering is a benefit does not demonstrate that the agency has been unreasonable, but simply expresses disagreement with the agency’s judgment, which as stated above, does not provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  The Ginn Group , supra.  As a result, we deny this protest allegation.   
 
Finally, KSHS asserts that it should have been assigned a strength for its compensation and comprehensive benefits package because its package identifies specific benefits that provide “an edge in hiring.”  Supp. Comments at 16.  The agency responds that t his 
feature in the KSHS proposal does not warrant a strength because it does not exceed the RFP’s requirements or add value.  The agency explains that developing appropriate compensation and benefit packages to retain the workforce is the responsibility of  an 
employer, and KSHS’s offering meets the requirements but does not merit a strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  KSHS responds that its packages did merit a strength because its specific offerings provide KSHS a competitive edge.  Supp. Comments at 16.   
 While KSHS argues that these offerings provide it a competitive edge, KSHS has failed to show that the agency unreasonably failed to assign its proposal a strength in this area.  The RFP stated several times that offerors were to describe approaches that  
       Page 10 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  demonstrated how they would retain talented staff and mitigate competition from other 
firms for staff, RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  The agency argues that the protester’s proposal met the RFP’s requirements and KSHS has not otherwise asserted or established  that its offering exceeds these requirements.  As a result, the protester has 
provided no basis to find that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretion not to assign KSHS’s proposal a strength.

DECISION  
K
ako’o Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, LLC (KSHS), a small business of Honolulu, 
Hawaii, protests the award of a contract to Cognito Systems, LLC, a small business of 
Newport News, Virginia, under request for proposals (RFP) No. M00264- 22-R- 0008, 
issued by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) for the services of certified athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists for the USMC’s sports medicine and injury program (SMIP).  The protester primarily asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
  Page 2 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   
We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The RFP, issued on August 2, 2022, sought to procure the services of certified athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists for the USMC’s SMIP.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP amend. 0005, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at ¶¶ 1.2- 1.3.  
SMIP was created to reduce injuries and lost workdays caused by musculoskeletal 
injuries.  Id.   The RFP anticipates that the trainers and specialists will provide state- of-
the art professional services to assist injured marines and accelerate their return to duty.  Id. 
 The RFP, set aside for small businesses, contemplated the award of a fixed- price 
indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract to be performed over five 1- year ordering 
periods, with the option to extend the contract for an additional six months.  AR, Tab 1, RFP at 73.  Award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value to the government based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  management and staffing approach, past performance, and price.  RFP  
amend. 0005 at 17- 20.  Offerors were to submit their proposals in four volumes, each 
with its own page limit.  The volume for management and staffing approach, the only factor at issue here, had a 50- page limit.  Id . at 14.   
 Under the management and staffing approach factor, the agency would evaluate each offeror’s approach to meeting the PWS requirements.  Specifically, the agency would 
evaluate the offeror’s experience in managing similar programs and how the offeror would provide continuous, quality, and timely support.  The agency would also evaluate the offeror’s plan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists.  This plan was to include an approach to mitigating competition from other firms seeking to hire the trainers and specialists.  Finally, the agency would 
evaluate the offeror’s operational plan for effective communication between the government and the offeror’s employees.  RFP amend. 0005 at 19.  Under this factor, the agency would assign a rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or 
unacceptable.  Id . at 18.   
 The USMC received proposals from 11 vendors, including KSHS, the incumbent contractor, and Cognito.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 7.  In September 2024, the agency conducted discussions with offerors and reevaluated pr oposals, including the technical and past performance volumes.  Id. 
at 8.  In its discussions letter to Cognito, the agency informed the firm that its management and staffing approach volume had been assigned three strengths and three weaknesses.  The agency also asked Cognito to respond to three questions.  AR, Tab 26, Cognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2.  Cognito responded to the questions in a 
document submitted as its final proposal revision (FPR).  AR, Tab 11, Cognito’s FPR.  The agency determined that C ognito’s management and staffing approach volume no 
longer had any weaknesses.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.  This round of  Page 3 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations yielded the final ratings for the technical and past performance volumes.  
COS/MOL at 8.  The agency made award to Cognito on November 14.  Id .   
 On December 2, KSHS filed a protest with our Office challenging the award, asserting that the USMC misevaluated proposals, conducted misleading discussions, unreasonably failed to find that Cognito was not a responsible contractor, and made an unreasonable source selection decision.  Kako’o Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, LLC, B-421127.2, Jan. 6, 2025 (unpublished decision) at 1.  The agency chose to take 
corrective action, stating that it would review the evaluations and make a new source selection decision.  Id.  As a result of the agency’s proposed corrective action, we 
dismissed the protest as academic on January 6, 2025.  Id .   
 As part of the agency’s corrective action, KSHS and Cognito were both invited to update their price volumes, but only KSHS submitted an updated price volume.  COS/MOL at 9.  The agency’s finalized evaluation included the technical and past performance rati ngs 
from September 2024, and the reevaluation of KSHS’s updated price from February 2025.  The final ratings were as follows:  
 
 KSHS  Cognito  
Management and Staffing Approach  Good  Outstanding  
Past Performance  Satisfactory  Satisfactory  
Price  $63,869,786  $61,288,781  
 AR, Tab 22, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 2.   
 
The agency made various findings and determinations for both proposals under the 
management and staffing approach factor.  The agency determined that KSHS’s proposal demonstrated a thorough approach to meeting the PWS requirements and a thorough understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id . at 3.  The agency 
assigned KSHS’s proposal one strength for its experience under the incumbent contract and assigned the KSHS proposal an overall rating of good.  Id .  
 The agency determined that Cognito’s proposal demonstrated an exceptional approach to meeting the PWS requirements and an exceptional understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id.  The agency assigned Cognito’s proposal three strengths.  One 
strength was assigned for the firm’s proposed [ DELETED] and another strength was 
assigned for Cognito’s experience staffing similar efforts for other Department of Defense organizations.  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency assigned a third strength for Cognito’s 
proposed [DELETED].   Id.  The agency assigned Cognito’s proposal an overall rating of 
outstanding.  Id. at 3.   
 Regarding past performance, the agency determined that it had reasonable confidence that both offerors would successfully perform the contract.  Id .  The agency further 
noted that both offeror’s prices were fair and reasonable.  Id.  In comparing the two 
proposals, the agency noted that Cognito’s proposal was superior to KSHS’s proposal under the management and staffing approach factor because it provided benefits that  Page 4 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  KSHS’s proposal did not.  Id. at 5.  Considering all this, the agency noted that the 
management and staffing approach factor was significantly more important than past 
performance and price, and that the first two factors were significantly more important than price when combined.  A s a result the agency determined that Cognito’s proposal 
was the best value for the agency because of its superior technical approach and 4.2 percent lower price.  Id.  On February 5, the agency made award to Cognito and notified 
KSHS the same day.  COS/MOL at 12.  KSHS subsequently received a debriefing, and this protest followed.    DISCUSSION  KSHS raises several challenges to the evaluation of proposals under the management and staffing approach factor.  We have considered them all and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that in reviewing protests challenging an agency ’s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate 
proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the 
solicitation ’s evaluation criteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.   Kupono

 Evaluation of Cognito’s Proposal  
 KSHS asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito’s management and staffing approach volume by improperly considering portions of the proposal that exceeded the page limits.  Supp. Comments at 2- 10.  KSHS first points to Cognito’s 
original propos al and asserts that it exceeded the page limit by one page and argues 
that this one page included information that informed part of the agency’s evaluation.  KSHS contends that, had the agency properly ignored this information in accordance with the page l imit requirements, Cognito would have received a lower rating and KSHS 
would likely have received award.  Id . at 2 -7.  KSHS next points to Cognito’s FPR and 
asserts that it also exceeded the page limits.  KSHS contends that Cognito supplied its revisions in a document separate from its original proposal and did not incorporate them into its original proposal, therefore including an additional six pages that exceeded the page limits.  Id . at 7 -9.  KSHS argues that Cognito’s FPR was what the agency relied on 
in assigning Cognito a rating of outstanding as its FPR cured the three weaknesses the agency had previously assigned.  KSHS contends that had the agency properly ignored Cognito’s FPR as exceeding the page limits, Cognito would have received a lower technical rating.  Id .  
 The USMC responds that, even if it improperly considered the additional pages in both Cognito’s original proposal and its FPR, then the agency essentially waived the page limit requirements and KSHS was not prejudiced by the waiver.  The agency contends that KSHS was not prejudiced because KSHS’s management and staffing approach 
volume was 20 pages below the page limit.  As a result, the agency argues, KSHS cannot show that it would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements by adding five extra  Page 5 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages to its proposal because it chose to submit a proposal that was already 20 pages 
under the limit.  Supp. MOL at 6- 7, 12 -13.   
 The protester responds that this standard of prejudice is inapplicable.  KSHS argues that the proper standard of prejudice is that had the agency excluded the extra pages, Cognito would not have been next in line for award and KSHS would likely have receiv ed the award, and therefore KSHS was competitively prejudiced.  Supp. 
Comments at 9- 10.  
 While we agree that the agency effectively waived the solicitation’s 50- page limit for the 
management and staffing approach volume in evaluating Cognito’s proposal, we find that the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency’s waiver .  In 
general, offerors must prepare their proposals within the format limitations set out in an agency ’s solicitation, including any applicable page limits.  DynCorp Int’l LLC , 
B-411126.4, et al. , Dec. 20, 2016, 2017 CPD ¶ 333 at 14.  Offerors that exceed a 
solicitation ’s established page limitations assume the risk that the agency will not 
consider the excess pages.  Id.  However, an agency may waive compliance with a 
material solicitation requirement, such as page limitations, in awarding a contract if the award will meet the agency’s actual needs without prejudice to other offerors.  DRS Network & Imaging Sys., LLC , B-413409, B -413409.2, Oct. 25, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 315 
at 9; LASEOD Group, LLC , B-405888, Jan. 10, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 45 at 5.  
 The solicitation required that offerors submit management and staffing approach volumes that were no more than 50 pages in length.  RFP amend. 0005 at 14.  Cognito’s original management and staffing approach volume is 51 pages long based 
on the Adobe PDF pagination, which includes every page in the volume, starting with the cover page.  AR, Tab 8.1, Cognito’s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1-51.  Based on the Adobe PDF pagination, page 1 of the volume is the cover page with 
no substantive inform ation on it and page 51 of the volume includes some substantive 
information of Cognito’s approach.  Id. at 1, 51.   
 Cognito’s response to the discussions letter, submitted as its FPR, consists of six pages in total according to the Adobe PDF pagination.  Four of these pages include Cognito’s response to the three questions raised by the agency.  AR, Tab 11, Cognito’s Fi nal 
Proposal Revisions at 2- 5.  Cognito’s response does not state that these pages replace 
pages in its original proposal, and Cognito did not submit a revised proposal including these new pages, but rather submitted these pages in response to the discussi ons 
letter.  Id. at 1.  The solicitation did not provide any information regarding page 
limitations for FPRs.  Additionally, while the discussions letters stated that responses would be “incorporated into [offerors’] Final Proposal Revisions,” the discussions letters did not state that revisions were not subject to the solicitation’s page limits.  AR, Tab 26, 
Cognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2. 
 As a result, based on our review of the record, we conclude that the agency effectively waived the management and staffing approach volume page limit of 50 pages for Cognito’s original proposal and its FPR.  The agency allowed Cognito an additional five  Page 6 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages in total beyond the limit –  1 from its original proposal, and 4 from its FPR, 
effectively waiving the requirement regarding page limitations.  However, this wavier 
does not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; and where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  DRS, supra  at 10.  In this regard, even where an 
agency waives a material solicitation requirement, our Office will not sustain the protest unless the protester can demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the waiver,  i.e., where 
the protester would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements.  Id.; Cerner Corp. , 
B-293093, B -293093.2, Feb. 2, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 34 at 7 n. 7.  In cases where the 
protester argues that an agency waived a certain requirement, prejudice does not mean that, had the agency failed to waive the requirement, the awardee would have been unsuc cessful.  LASEOD, supra.  Rather, the pertinent question is whether the prot ester 
would have submitted a different offer that would have had a reasonable possibility of being selected for award had it known that the requirement would be waived.  Id . 
 KSHS’s original management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages based on the Adobe PDF pagination.  AR, Tab 5.1, KSHS’s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1- 31.  Its FPR only affected its price volume, which had no page limitations.  
RFP amend. 0005 at 14; AR, Tab 25, KSHS Discussions Letter at 1.  As a result, KSHS’s final page count for its management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages, which is 19 pages below the 50- page limit.  In order for KSHS to be prejudiced 
by the agency’s waive r of page limits for the management and staffing approach 
volume, KSHS would have needed to demonstrate how it would have altered its volume to its competitive advantage had it been aware that it could use an additional five pages.  As KSHS’s volume is 19 pages below the limit, KSHS has not argued and cannot show it would have made use of an additional five pages to its competitive advantage.  Thus, the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency’s waiver, and we deny this aspect of KS HS’s protest.  Cerner, supra; LASEOD, supra . 
 KSHS next argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito’s management and staffing approach volume because it did not document whether Cognito’s approach to locating, recruiting, and retaining athletic trainers met the solicitation’s requirements.  KSHS also argues that even if the USMC had documented this aspect of the proposal, its conclusion that Cognito’s approach met this requirement is unreasonable because Cognito is using the same approach that was negatively rated in one of its past performance references.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8; Supp. Comments at 10- 12.   
 The USMC responds that the record is sufficiently documented because it conducted its evaluation in accordance with the RFP’s terms, and specifically noted any strengths, weaknesses, and significant weaknesses, and the rationale for them.  Supp. MOL at 14.   
The agency further asserts that it was not required to document proposal content that simply met criteria as agencies are not required to document every detail of their  Page 7 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations.  The agency also contends that KSHS has not argued or demonstrated that 
Cognito’s technical volume does not meet the requirement regarding recruitment and retainer, but rather argues only that the agency should have evaluated Cognito’s proposal in a manner inconsistent with the solicitation criteria– that is, by considering 
past performance ratings in the technical evaluation.  Id . at 15- 16.  
 We find that the record is sufficiently documented.  While an agency ’s evaluation 
judgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show it is not arbitrary, a failure to discuss every detail regarding the relative merit of a proposal in an evaluation decision document does not affect the validity of the evaluation.  Artek Constr. Co., B -418657, 
B-418657.2, July 17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 285 at 9 n.14 (denying protester’s argument 
that the agency failed to document its evaluation where the evaluation did not detail why a portion of the protester’s proposal was inadequate because agencies are not required to discuss every detail of the relative merit of a proposal).  Additionally, as noted below, post-protest explanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be 
considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id. 
 The RFP required that offerors provide a “plan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength conditioning coaches who meet or exceed the minimum standards.”  RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  In its technical evaluations, the agency noted strengt hs and weaknesses and cited to the portions of proposals supporting those 
assessments.  The agency also included a paragraph summarizing its findings for each proposal.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 4- 13.  The agency only notes portions 
of proposal s that merited strengths or demonstrated weaknesses and did not take note 
of portions that simply met requirements.  Supp. COS/MOL at 4, 14.   
 Regarding Cognito’s proposal, the agency noted the portions that merited strengths and displayed weaknesses.
1  The agency summarized its view of Cognito’s proposal in a 
paragraph, noting that it had an exceptional understanding of the requirements, excellent experience, and the agency expected Cognito could successfully perform the contract.  AR, Tab 17, Technica l Evaluations at 4- 7.  During the development of the 
protest, the agency supplied additional statements from the contracting officer and the technical evaluation team (TET) chair to support these findings.  Again, post -protest 
explanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  The contracting officer explains that the TET was to review the entirety of each proposal, but only document portions that 
exceeded the requirements or failed to meet them.  Supp. COS/MOL at 3- 4.  The 
contracting officer also states that the absence of any discussion about a particular requirement meant the offeror’s proposal met that requirement.  Id. at 4.  The TET chair 
also states that if a proposal met a requirement but did not exceed it, the TET did not note it.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.   
 
1 The technical evaluation notes how these weaknesses were cured following FPRs.  
AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.    Page 8 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   
Here, the record shows that the agency considered the contents of each proposal and documented its evaluation.  In this regard, the agency’s post -protest conclusions are 
reasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  The protester is incorrect that  the 
agency failed to document its evaluation simply because it utilized a methodology of documenting only the portions of proposals that exceeded or failed to meet requirements and making no notations on portions that met requirements.  As a result, the protester has not shown that the agency failed to document its findings.  Konica Minolta Bus. Sols. USA, Inc. , B-418800, B -418800.2, Sep. 4, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 292 at 
6 n.4 (explaining that the agency’s choice not to document all determinations of adequacy did not render the evaluation unreasonable or inadequately documented).   
In addition, we are not persuaded by the protester’s argument that the agency should have considered Cognito’s past performance information as part of its technical evaluation.  The RFP did not require such consideration, and the protester does not identif y any portion of the RFP that supports its argument.   
 Evaluation of KSHS’s Proposal  
 KSHS argues that the agency should have assigned its management and staffing approach volume six additional strengths.  We have reviewed all KSHS’s arguments and find that it has not demonstrated that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretio n not to assign additional strengths.  We address three examples below.    
 KSHS first asserts that its proposal should have been assigned a strength for its “unparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its 
experienced [human performance] program manager.”  Supp. Comments at 14.  The agency responds that KSHS already received a strength for its experience, and there was no reason to assign an additional strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.  The protester counters that the agency did not address its program manager’s 
experience specifi cally, which merited a strength by itself, and therefore the agency has 
conceded this issue.  Supp. Comments at 14.   
 We are not persuaded.  The agency’s response addressed KSHS’s experience as the incumbent contractor, which would extend to its program manager’s experience.  Compare Comments & Supp. Protest at 9 (asserting that the protester’s proposal 
exceeded requirements with “unparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its experienced [human performance] program manager”) with  AR, 
Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1 (stating that “KSHS was provided a strength for experience. This proposal feature addresses incumbency and experience . . . on the previous SMIP contract.  No additional strength was distinguished in this proposed feature.”).    Second, the protester’s argument rests on a misunderstanding of the standard we apply when determining whether an agency reasonably exercised its discretion not to assign a strength.  The protester implies that because its experience exceeded the requirements, it is necessarily entitled to a strength.  This is incorrect.  A n agency ’s judgment of  Page 9 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  whether to assess unique strengths is a matter within the agency ’s discretion and one 
that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the evaluation 
was unreasonable.   APC Constr., LLC, B -419771, July 13, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 258 at 8.  
It is up to the agency to determine whether an offering, even one that exceeds the requirements, merits a strength so long as the agency’s decision has a reasonable basis.  The protester does not challenge t he agency’s assertion that its experience was 
already accounted for and neither does the protester demonstrate how the agency’s decision not to assign a strength was unreasonable.  As a result, the protester’s argument amounts to disagreement with the agency’s decision which does not provide a basis  to sustain the protest.  APC, supra  at 10; The Ginn Group., Inc. , B-420165, 
B-420165.2, Dec. 22, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 17 at 9.   
 KSHS next asserts that it should have received a strength for proposing an “uninterrupted transition in 15 days or less” at the start of contract performance.  Supp. Comments at 15.  The agency responds that this offering did not merit a strength because t he awardee is required to commence performance on the performance start 
date, and the agency viewed this offering as KSHS simply affirming that it would meet the requirement.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  The protester responds that its transition timeline is nevertheless clearly a benefit to the agency.  Supp. Comments at 15.  KSHS has not demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  The firm’s response that this offering is a benefit does not demonstrate that the agency has been unreasonable, but simply expresses disagreement with the agency’s judgment, which as stated above, does not provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  The Ginn Group , supra.  As a result, we deny this protest allegation.   
 
Finally, KSHS asserts that it should have been assigned a strength for its compensation and comprehensive benefits package because its package identifies specific benefits that provide “an edge in hiring.”  Supp. Comments at 16.  The agency responds that t his 
feature in the KSHS proposal does not warrant a strength because it does not exceed the RFP’s requirements or add value.  The agency explains that developing appropriate compensation and benefit packages to retain the workforce is the responsibility of  an 
employer, and KSHS’s offering meets the requirements but does not merit a strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  KSHS responds that its packages did merit a strength because its specific offerings provide KSHS a competitive edge.  Supp. Comments at 16.   
 While KSHS argues that these offerings provide it a competitive edge, KSHS has failed to show that the agency unreasonably failed to assign its proposal a strength in this area.  The RFP stated several times that offerors were to describe approaches that  
       Page 10 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  demonstrated how they would retain talented staff and mitigate competition from other 
firms for staff, RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  The agency argues that the protester’s proposal met the RFP’s requirements and KSHS has not otherwise asserted or established  that its offering exceeds these requirements.  As a result, the protester has 
provided no basis to find that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretion not to assign KSHS’s proposal a strength.

2 KSHS asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the alleged flaws 
in the evaluation.  Where other challenges to an evaluation of quotations have been denied or otherwise dismissed, a challenge to the best -value determination based on 
those allegations does not afford a basis to sustain the protest.   Facility Servs. Mgmt.,

,"May 6, 2025",Perimeter Solutions LP,"Protest is dismissed where the protester is not an interested party to challenge the agency’s intended award of a contract on a sole- source basis because the firm does not 
similarly offer a “conditionally qualified” product.  
DECISION  
 Perimeter Solutions LP, of Saint Louis, Missouri, protests the intended sole- source 
award of a contract to Fortress North America, LLC, of Rocklin, California, under request for proposals (RFP) No. 1202SC25R2500, issued by the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, for supply of Qela, an aerial long- term fire retardant (LTFR).  
Perimeter challenges the agency’s justification for the sole- source award.  
 We dismiss the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The agency uses qualified aerial LTFR products applied by airtanker or helicopter to reduce wildfire intensity and the rate of wildfire spread.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 2; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1.  To become qualified, a manufacturer 
must notify the agency that it wishes to submit an LTFR product for evaluation.  Protest at 4.  The manufacturer’s product must then satisfy a laboratory evaluation consisting of multiple tests, including uniform corrosion, mammalian toxicity and irritation, combustion -retarding effectiveness, physical properties, materials effects, pumpability, DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423321; B -423321.2  product stability, and color properties.  Id.  at 4-5; see also Agency Report (AR), Tab 2, 
LTFR Specification, at  17-23.   
 
Based on the results of the laboratory testing, the agency may determine that the product is “fully qualified” or “conditionally qualified.”  MOL at 3.  “Conditionally Qualified” products require an operational field evaluation (OFE).  Id.; see also AR, 
Tab 3, OFE Description at 2.  The scope of an OFE will vary depending on the product.  
AR, Tab 3, OFE Description at 2 (“The [OFE] may vary from a slight increase in sampling, to a detailed complex evaluation.”).  At a minimum, the OFE will use 200,000 gallons of LTFR.  Id.  If the product passes the OFE, then it will be considered “fully 
qualified” and added to the qualified products list (QPL).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specification at 17.   
 Perimeter currently is the sole supplier of LTFR and ancillary services to the Forest Service under an existing contract.  Protest at 5.  Perimeter states that its contract provides it with the exclusive right to provide LTFR to the Forest Service, except that the government may purchase 200,000 gallons of a “conditionally qualified” LTFR for field testing.  Id.  Perimeter also explains that its contract provides that the government may 
only compensate another manufacturer for a “conditionally qualified” pr oduct at the 
same rate it pays to Perimeter.  Id.    
 Fortress is a subsidiary of Compass Minerals and is a relatively new manufacturer of LTFR products.  COS at 3.  In 2022, Fortress obtained full qualification for two products; 
however, one of Fortress’s products caused significant corrosion for two government 
aircraft and the agency subsequently removed both products from the QPL.  COS 
at 3-4.  As a result, the agency also revised the specification for any LTFR to require 
that any product use only one or a combination of retarding salts ( i.e., diammonium 
phosphate, monoammonium phosphate, or ammonium polyphosphate).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specificat ion at 33.  
 Fortress subsequently sought to qualify another LTFR product, Qela.  AR, Tab 4, Letter from Agency to Fortress at 1.  In September 2024, the agency reviewed the results of Qela’s laboratory evaluation and determined that the product satisfied all the speci fication requirements except for corrosion to magnesium coupons ( i.e., metal 
samples).  Id. at 1-2.  In November 2024, the agency determined that the product was 
“conditionally qualified,” but that an OFE would need to be conducted to ensure that the product does not accelerate corrosion of government aircraft.  AR, Tab 7, Internal 
Correspondence at 1; see also AR, Tab 8, Letter from Agency to Fortress at 1.  On 
December 5, the Forest Service officially added Qela to the QPL as “conditionally qualified.”  COS at 8.   
 On January 29, 2025, the Forest Service issued a notice that it intended to award a requirements contract for Qela and ancillary support services to Compass Minerals.  AR, Tab 11, Notice of Intent to Award a Sole- Source Contract at 2.  The notice 
explained that only one responsible source offered Qela and cited 41 U.S.C. 
§ 3304(a)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  section 6.302- 1,  Page 3 B-423321; B -423321.2  as its authority for issuing the contract on a sole- source basis.  Id.  at 2-3.  The notice 
also provided that any LTFR producers could submit a capabilities statement, proposal, 
or quotation within 15 days ( i.e., by February 13).  Id. at 3.   
 In the accompanying “Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition” (JOFC) document, the Forest Service explained the following:  
 
No other contractor has completed the predecessor steps in the QPL process to become conditionally qualified and eligible for an [official field evaluation (OFE)] and therefore the Contractor is the only supplier that meets the authorities specified herein.  
 AR, Tab 9, JOFC at 2.  The JOFC also provided that the agency would order 900,000 gallons of Qela, including 200,000 gallons for regular testing and the other 700,000 gallons for additional testing to ensure that the product can be comingled with other LTFR products and will not accelerate the corrosion of government aircraft.  Id.  at 1-2. 
Additionally, the JOFC explained that the contract had an estimated value of $13 million and that the agency will use cost analysis techniques to ensure that the price is  fair and 
reasonable.  Id. at 1. 
 On February 7, Perimeter filed this protest with our Office.  
 DISCUSSION  Perimeter raises multiple allegations challenging the agency’s use of non- competitive 
procedures.  Principally, Perimeter argues that the agency unreasonably seeks to procure 700,000 gallons for additional testing.  Perimeter also argues that the agency will unreasonably procure ancillary services.  Additionally, the protester contends that the agency failed to consider its alternate product.  Finally, Perimeter asserts that the sole-source award will create an unfair competitive advantage for Fortress.  
 While presenting arguments countering the merits of protester’s allegations, the Forest Service also argues that Perimeter is not an interested party to raise its challenges.  We agree with the agency that the firm does not demonstrate the requisite interest and therefore dismiss the protest without addressing the underlying merits.  
 The agency argues that Perimeter is not an interested party because the firm does not manufacture Qela.  MOL at 11- 14.  The agency explains that it needs to test Qela to 
determine whether the product may be considered “fully qualified.”   Id.  12.  Thus, since 
Perimeter manufactures a competitor product, the Forest Service asserts that Perimeter is not an interested party because it cannot satisfy the agency’s need.  Id. 
 Perimeter counters that the firm is an interested party because it also possesses a “conditionally qualified” product eligible for an OFE.  Comments at 33; Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 10.  It argues that the agency plans to test only one product this season, and should the agency elect to test Fortress’s product, then it will lose the opportunity to  Page 4 B-423321; B -423321.2  have its product tested.  Perimeter also argues that the agency fabricated the testing 
requirement to render the firm not an interested party.  Supp. Comments at 4.   
 During the development of this protest, we sought additional information regarding Perimeter’s product to aid in our determination of whether the firm was an interested party.  Specifically, we inquired:  
 
GAO requests that the agency provide additional information concerning whether Perimeter is an interested party.  In so doing, GAO requests that the agency explain whether Perimeter does, in fact, have a “conditionally qualified” product.  GAO would apprec iate the agency providing additional 
details explaining why Perimeter’s product is “not ready, slated, or planned for an OFE anytime soon.”  [COS at 19].  The agency should also explain the difference between Perimeter’s and Fortress’s products.  Finally, GAO would appreciate the agency clarifying how the products are different in terms of where they are in the qualification process.  
 GAO Second Req. for Additional Briefing at 1- 2.   
 In response, the agency explained that it notified Perimeter that one of its products was conditionally qualified in November 2024.  Supp. COS at 2; AR, Tab 19, Letter from Agency to Perimeter at 1.  However, the agency explains that it is currently revisi ng its 
testing requirements ( i.e., specification) to include additional galvanic corrosion testing.
1  
Supp. COS at 2- 3. The agency explains that “[r]ecent work showed that adopting a 
galvanic corrosion test will help screen products that would otherwise meet current 
corrosion test criteria.”  Id.  Further, the agency explains that the lab recommends 
adopting the test to “maintain a fair and consistent approach to all products currently 
being test[ed] for eligibility consideration[.]”  Id.  
 
While Perimeter’s product has not yet completed the galvanic corrosion testing, the agency explains that Fortress’s product, Qela, has completed this requirement.  Supp. COS at 2.  As a result, the agency asserts that Perimeter is not an interested party because it does not have a competitor product ready for field evaluation.  See id.  at 4; 
see also MOL at 16.

 On this record, we find that Perimeter is not an interested party.  Even if we concluded that the agency unreasonably restricted competition, Perimeter would not be positioned to compete for an award.
  Our review of the record shows that Fortress’s product has 
completed the new galvanic corrosion test while Perimeter’s relevant products have not.
2  While Perimeter may argue that one of its products is “conditionally qualified” 
because it received a letter notifying the firm to that effect, we note that the determination of whether Perimeter’s product is ready for a field evaluation is a discretiona ry matter reserved to the agency; in this regard, the Forest Service has 
explained that Perimeter’s product must undergo the galvanic corrosion test and that it will issue a new letter communicating this fact.  Supp. COS at 3; s ee Automated Power

First, we determine whether a party is interested based on the current record, which, as noted above, shows that Perimeter’s product has not yet satisfied the new galvanic corrosion testing requirement.  Second, an agency need not forgo meeting current needs solely based on the prospect of enhanced future competition where it has an undisputed need involving a matter of public safety.

have a product tested.  
 Additionally, we have no basis to conclude that the agency fabricated the testing requirement.  The agency has reasonably explained that the new test is necessary to ensure that any LTFR products do not accelerate corrosion, as well as maintain a fair qualifications process.  The record also shows that the agency started revising its 
specification to include the additional testing requirement as early as November 2024.  AR, Tab 7, Internal Agency Memorandum at 1 (explaining that the agency’s National Technology and Development Program (NTDP) “is currently working [Fire and Aviation Management] and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to update [the specification] to include additional laboratory testing that would identify revisions and the addition of other corrosion tests to reduce or eliminate the corrosion concerns”).   
 Moreover, Perimeter’s product simply does not fulfill the agency’s need.  The agency explains, and our review of the record confirms, that it needs to determine whether Qela is a viable LTFR product.  Testing Perimeter’s product simply has no bearing on determining whether Qela is viable.  In any event, the agency explains that it will likely acquire any amount of Perimeter’s product needed for testing through a sole- source 
acquisition as well.  MOL at 19- 20 (“More importantly, under the Forest Services’ testing 
specification, each candidate’s product must be tested.  In this case, Forest Service is seeking Qela to test Qela.  If and when additional products are ready for [a field examination], those products will each have to be acquired and presumably will  be

the protest.

DIGEST  
 Protest is dismissed where the protester is not an interested party to challenge the agency’s intended award of a contract on a sole- source basis because the firm does not 
similarly offer a “conditionally qualified” product.  
DECISION  
 Perimeter Solutions LP, of Saint Louis, Missouri, protests the intended sole- source 
award of a contract to Fortress North America, LLC, of Rocklin, California, under request for proposals (RFP) No. 1202SC25R2500, issued by the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, for supply of Qela, an aerial long- term fire retardant (LTFR).  
Perimeter challenges the agency’s justification for the sole- source award.  
 We dismiss the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The agency uses qualified aerial LTFR products applied by airtanker or helicopter to reduce wildfire intensity and the rate of wildfire spread.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 2; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1.  To become qualified, a manufacturer 
must notify the agency that it wishes to submit an LTFR product for evaluation.  Protest at 4.  The manufacturer’s product must then satisfy a laboratory evaluation consisting of multiple tests, including uniform corrosion, mammalian toxicity and irritation, combustion -retarding effectiveness, physical properties, materials effects, pumpability, DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.

LTFR Specification, at  17-23.   
 
Based on the results of the laboratory testing, the agency may determine that the product is “fully qualified” or “conditionally qualified.”  MOL at 3.  “Conditionally Qualified” products require an operational field evaluation (OFE).  Id.; see also AR, 
Tab 3, OFE Description at 2.  The scope of an OFE will vary depending on the product.  
AR, Tab 3, OFE Description at 2 (“The [OFE] may vary from a slight increase in sampling, to a detailed complex evaluation.”).  At a minimum, the OFE will use 200,000 gallons of LTFR.  Id.  If the product passes the OFE, then it will be considered “fully 
qualified” and added to the qualified products list (QPL).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specification at 17.   
 Perimeter currently is the sole supplier of LTFR and ancillary services to the Forest Service under an existing contract.  Protest at 5.  Perimeter states that its contract provides it with the exclusive right to provide LTFR to the Forest Service, except that the government may purchase 200,000 gallons of a “conditionally qualified” LTFR for field testing.  Id.  Perimeter also explains that its contract provides that the government may 
only compensate another manufacturer for a “conditionally qualified” pr oduct at the 
same rate it pays to Perimeter.  Id.    
 Fortress is a subsidiary of Compass Minerals and is a relatively new manufacturer of LTFR products.  COS at 3.  In 2022, Fortress obtained full qualification for two products; 
however, one of Fortress’s products caused significant corrosion for two government 
aircraft and the agency subsequently removed both products from the QPL.  COS 
at 3-4.  As a result, the agency also revised the specification for any LTFR to require 
that any product use only one or a combination of retarding salts ( i.e., diammonium 
phosphate, monoammonium phosphate, or ammonium polyphosphate).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specificat ion at 33.  
 Fortress subsequently sought to qualify another LTFR product, Qela.  AR, Tab 4, Letter from Agency to Fortress at 1.  In September 2024, the agency reviewed the results of Qela’s laboratory evaluation and determined that the product satisfied all the speci fication requirements except for corrosion to magnesium coupons ( i.e., metal 
samples).  Id. at 1-2.  In November 2024, the agency determined that the product was 
“conditionally qualified,” but that an OFE would need to be conducted to ensure that the product does not accelerate corrosion of government aircraft.  AR, Tab 7, Internal 
Correspondence at 1; see also AR, Tab 8, Letter from Agency to Fortress at 1.  On 
December 5, the Forest Service officially added Qela to the QPL as “conditionally qualified.”  COS at 8.   
 On January 29, 2025, the Forest Service issued a notice that it intended to award a requirements contract for Qela and ancillary support services to Compass Minerals.  AR, Tab 11, Notice of Intent to Award a Sole- Source Contract at 2.  The notice 
explained that only one responsible source offered Qela and cited 41 U.S.C. 
§ 3304(a)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  section 6.302- 1,  Page 3 B-423321; B -423321.2  as its authority for issuing the contract on a sole- source basis.  Id.  at 2-3.  The notice 
also provided that any LTFR producers could submit a capabilities statement, proposal, 
or quotation within 15 days ( i.e., by February 13).  Id. at 3.   
 In the accompanying “Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition” (JOFC) document, the Forest Service explained the following:  
 
No other contractor has completed the predecessor steps in the QPL process to become conditionally qualified and eligible for an [official field evaluation (OFE)] and therefore the Contractor is the only supplier that meets the authorities specified herein.  
 AR, Tab 9, JOFC at 2.  The JOFC also provided that the agency would order 900,000 gallons of Qela, including 200,000 gallons for regular testing and the other 700,000 gallons for additional testing to ensure that the product can be comingled with other LTFR products and will not accelerate the corrosion of government aircraft.  Id.  at 1-2. 
Additionally, the JOFC explained that the contract had an estimated value of $13 million and that the agency will use cost analysis techniques to ensure that the price is  fair and 
reasonable.  Id. at 1. 
 On February 7, Perimeter filed this protest with our Office.  
 DISCUSSION  Perimeter raises multiple allegations challenging the agency’s use of non- competitive 
procedures.  Principally, Perimeter argues that the agency unreasonably seeks to procure 700,000 gallons for additional testing.  Perimeter also argues that the agency will unreasonably procure ancillary services.  Additionally, the protester contends that the agency failed to consider its alternate product.  Finally, Perimeter asserts that the sole-source award will create an unfair competitive advantage for Fortress.  
 While presenting arguments countering the merits of protester’s allegations, the Forest Service also argues that Perimeter is not an interested party to raise its challenges.  We agree with the agency that the firm does not demonstrate the requisite interest and therefore dismiss the protest without addressing the underlying merits.  
 The agency argues that Perimeter is not an interested party because the firm does not manufacture Qela.  MOL at 11- 14.  The agency explains that it needs to test Qela to 
determine whether the product may be considered “fully qualified.”   Id.  12.  Thus, since 
Perimeter manufactures a competitor product, the Forest Service asserts that Perimeter is not an interested party because it cannot satisfy the agency’s need.  Id. 
 Perimeter counters that the firm is an interested party because it also possesses a “conditionally qualified” product eligible for an OFE.  Comments at 33; Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 10.  It argues that the agency plans to test only one product this season, and should the agency elect to test Fortress’s product, then it will lose the opportunity to  Page 4 B-423321; B -423321.2  have its product tested.  Perimeter also argues that the agency fabricated the testing 
requirement to render the firm not an interested party.  Supp. Comments at 4.   
 During the development of this protest, we sought additional information regarding Perimeter’s product to aid in our determination of whether the firm was an interested party.  Specifically, we inquired:  
 
GAO requests that the agency provide additional information concerning whether Perimeter is an interested party.  In so doing, GAO requests that the agency explain whether Perimeter does, in fact, have a “conditionally qualified” product.  GAO would apprec iate the agency providing additional 
details explaining why Perimeter’s product is “not ready, slated, or planned for an OFE anytime soon.”  [COS at 19].  The agency should also explain the difference between Perimeter’s and Fortress’s products.  Finally, GAO would appreciate the agency clarifying how the products are different in terms of where they are in the qualification process.  
 GAO Second Req. for Additional Briefing at 1- 2.   
 In response, the agency explained that it notified Perimeter that one of its products was conditionally qualified in November 2024.  Supp. COS at 2; AR, Tab 19, Letter from Agency to Perimeter at 1.  However, the agency explains that it is currently revisi ng its 
testing requirements ( i.e., specification) to include additional galvanic corrosion testing.
1  
Supp. COS at 2- 3. The agency explains that “[r]ecent work showed that adopting a 
galvanic corrosion test will help screen products that would otherwise meet current 
corrosion test criteria.”  Id.  Further, the agency explains that the lab recommends 
adopting the test to “maintain a fair and consistent approach to all products currently 
being test[ed] for eligibility consideration[.]”  Id.  
 
While Perimeter’s product has not yet completed the galvanic corrosion testing, the agency explains that Fortress’s product, Qela, has completed this requirement.  Supp. COS at 2.  As a result, the agency asserts that Perimeter is not an interested party because it does not have a competitor product ready for field evaluation.  See id.  at 4; 
see also MOL at 16.  
 
The protester responds that it is an interested party because its competitor product 
satisfied required testing and was previously determined to be “conditionally qualified.”  
Resp. to Supp. COS at 3.  Additionally, Perimeter asserts that the galvanic test ing will 
be completed soon and that, therefore, the firm still has an eligible product for this

DECISION  
 Manhattan Telecommunications Corporation, LLC  (MetTel), a small business of New 
York, New York, protests the actions of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in 
procuring telecommunications services, including toll -free telephone numbers.  MetTel, 
a contractor currently providing telecommunication services to SSA, contends that SSA improperly issued a sole- source task order for such services without notice or 
justification in violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  MetTel also argues 
that the agency improperly terminated the task order under which the protester provides 
telecommunications services to SSA.

DISCUSSION 
 
MetTel raises multiple arguments concerning SSA ’s acquisition of its required toll -free 
services.  Initially, MetTel argues that the agency had partially cancelled its contract to 
provide toll -free service and made a sole- source award to AWS without publicizing or 
justifying its decision.  Protest at  4-6.  After the agency clarified that it had issued a task 
order to Four Points, not AWS, MetTel further argues that SSA improperly issued the task order to Four Points because the Amazon Connect services exceed the scope of Four Points’s GSA schedule contract for cloud computing and Four Points is ineligible to provide toll -free services because it is not a registered provider in accordance with 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations .  Supp. Protest at  4-5.   
 The agency requests that our Office dismiss all of MetTel’s initial protest grounds, arguing that they are legally insufficient and involve matters of contract administration over which GAO does not exercise jurisdiction.  First Req. for Dismissal at  4-7.  SSA 
also argues that we should dismiss MetTel’s supplemental protest on the basis that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points and that MetTel raises matters of contract administration.  Second Req. for Dismissal at  3-4, 
9-10; COS/MOL at 9- 10.  W e dismiss the protest grounds as discussed below.

 Contract Administration  
 We first address MetTel’s allegations that the SSA has improperly cancelled portions of its contract to provide telecommunications services, including toll -free services.  Protest 
at 4-6.  In its request for dismissal, the agency argues that MetTel’s compl aint about the 
reduction in MetTel’s services is “a pure contract administration matter” over which GAO 
 
3 Throughout the record the terms “AWS Connect” and “Amazon Connect” are used 
interchangeably when discussing the AWS product for a CCaaS, which is a virtual contact center.  See AR, Exh. 7, AWS Amazon Connect Documentation Website at  1. 
4 While we do not address every argument raised in this protest , we have reviewed 
each issue and do not find any basis to sustain the protest.   The agency also raises 
additional grounds for dismissal of the protest.  Because we agree with the agency that 
the protester is not an interested party to challenge Four Points’s task order award, we 
need not resolve the alternative asserted bases for dismissal.   Page 4 B-423414; B -423414.2  has no jurisdiction.  First Req. for Dismissal at 7.  We agree with the agency and 
dismiss these protest allegations on that basis.

situations where GAO reviews protest grounds challenging contract termination).  
 This exception is inapplicable here.  The record shows that SSA pays for the toll -free 
services used under the Grand SLLAM task order contract with MetTel.  AR, Exh . 9, 
Grand SLLAM Task Order at  17-35; 98- 99; see also COS/MOL at  9-10.  SSA is not 
obligated to use the contract with MetTel as the only means of obtaining the toll -free 
services it needs.  Moreover, MetTel has not alleged SSA decreased its usage of toll -
free services because of a perceived defect with the award of the initial Grand SLLAM task or der to MetTel.  Accordingly, any reduction of MetTel’s toll -free services is a 
matter of contract administration and we dismiss this protest ground because it raises 
an issue GAO will not consider.    Insufficient Protest Allegations  
 Next, the protester argues that the agency improperly awarded a sole- source contract to 
AWS for toll -free services in violation of FAR parts 5 and 6, which require publication of 
contract actions and documented justification for a non- competitive award, respectively.  
Protest at  4-6.  In response, SSA requests dismissal of the protest because MetTel is 
mistaken about the contract vehicle the agency is using to procure the toll -free services.  
In this connection, the agency advises that in August 2024, it is sued a task order to 
Four Points, not AWS, for Amazon Connect, a cloud computing service, under an existing BPA established with Four Points for access to commercial cloud computing services.  First Req. for Dismissal at  2, 4-6.  The agency argues that Met Tel’s protest 
grounds do not state a valid basis for protest because they are based on an incorrect contract awardee and are therefore legally and factually insufficient.  Id. at 4-6.  We 
agree.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations require a protester to include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4), (f).  That is, a protest must include sufficient f actual 
bases to establish a reasonable potential that the protester’s allegations may have  Page 5 B-423414; B -423414.2  merit.  Chags Health Info. Tech., LLC , B-420940.3 et al. , Dec. 14, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 315 at 5.  Where a protester’s allegations are based on speculation, factual 
inaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions, GAO will summarily dismiss the protest 
without requiring the agency to submit a report.  4 C.F.R. § 21.5; Excelsior Ambulance Serv., Inc ., B-421948, Sept.  27, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 220 at 3.  
 The record demonstrates that MetTel’s protest was based on faulty facts and a flawed legal assumption.  SSA established a BPA with Four Points in December 2020 for access to commercial cloud computing services.  In August 2024, pursuant to the BPA, the agency issued a task order to Four Points for Amazon Connect, a CCaaS that includes providing toll -free services to the agency.  SSA did not make a sole- source 
award to AWS for toll -free services.  Because this protest ground is based on inaccurate 
factual as sertions, we dismiss it as failing to state a valid basis for protest.  
 Interested Party  
 MetTel  also challenges SSA’s issuance of the task order to Four Points and asserts that 
the toll -free services are outside the scope of Four Points’s GSA schedule contract.  
Specifically, MetTel argues that Four Points’s GSA schedule contract allows it “to resel l 
specific IT hardware and software licenses and services to the federal government,” but that the specified items do not include the toll -free services that MetTel provides to SSA.  
Supp. Protest at 3- 5.  The protester also argues that SSA’s contract with Four Points 
violates FCC regulations because operators of toll -free services are required to be 
registered with the FCC and Four Points is not.  Id.   
 
The agency requests dismissal of this protest ground, arguing that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points because MetTel is not “an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.”  Second Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4 (quoting the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, 
31 U.S.C. §  3551(2) ).   
 The agency contends that MetTel  has not alleged it competed for the BPA established 
with Four Points in 2020 or that MetTel was even eligible to compete for the BPA.  Id. at 3.  In this connection, SSA contends that the protester would be ineligible for award if 
its protest were to be sustained because MetTel does not have a GSA schedule contract that includes access to AWS commercial cloud computing services, including Amazon Connect.  Id. at 4.  The agency contends that the protester cannot show that 
the agency’s award of the task order to Four Points directly affects the protester’s economic interest, and therefore, the protester is not an interested party.  Id.  
 In response, the protester concedes that it did not participate in the BPA competition and that it does not have a GSA schedule contract for access to commercial cloud computing services.  Comments at 12- 13.  MetTel nonetheless argues that it has an 
econom ic interest because SSA’s use of MetTel’s services has decreased as a result of 
the agency’s task order award to Four Points.  Id.  Page 6 B-423414; B -423414.2   
Under the bid protest provisions of CICA, only an “interested party” may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. §  3551(2) ; 4 C.F.R. § 21.0(a).  That is, a protester must 
be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract.  4 C.F.R. § 21.0(a).  Determining whether a party is interested involves consideration of a variety of factors, including the nature of the issues raised, the benefit or relief sought by the protester, and the party’s status in relation to the procurement.  Four Winds Servs ., Inc. , 
B-280714, Aug. 28, 1998, 98- 2 CPD ¶ 57 at 2.  A protester is not an interested party 
where it would not be eligible to receive a contract award were its protest to be sustained, including, for example, where it does not have a GSA schedule contract that includes the services sought by the agency.  See  C3.ai , B-421337, B -421337.2,

 On this record, we find that the protester has not shown, or even alleged, that it is a prospective offeror eligible to compete for a task order for the Amazon Connect services sought by the agency.  We also find that MetTel’s economic interest in the proc urement 
is too remote.  In this connection, MetTel argues it has a direct economic interest in the procurement because the agency is using less of its services due to the Four Points task order.  While the volume of services that the agency orders under it s existing task 
order with MetTel may be impacted by SSA’s issuance of the task order to Four Points, this is not the kind of direct economic interest contemplated by our Bid Protest Regulations.  See Intellectix Corp. , B-420552 et al. , May 27, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  135 at 6 
(concluding protester ’s economic interest is too remote for the firm to be considered an 
interested party to challenge the agency’s task order award when the protester does not

schedule contract for cloud computing services (special item number 518210C) and it is incapable of providing SSA with the Amazon Connect services required so SSA is unable to issue a task order to MetTel for the requirement.  Because MetTel would not be eligible for contract award even if its protest is sustained, we conclude that MetTel is not an interested party to pursue a protest of SSA’s issuance of a task order to Four Points.

DIGEST  
 Protester is not an interested party to challenge the issuance of a task order against a General Services Administration schedule contract when the protester does not hold a schedule contract for the commercial cloud services sought by the agency.  
DECISION  
 Manhattan Telecommunications Corporation, LLC  (MetTel), a small business of New 
York, New York, protests the actions of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in 
procuring telecommunications services, including toll -free telephone numbers.  MetTel, 
a contractor currently providing telecommunication services to SSA, contends that SSA improperly issued a sole- source task order for such services without notice or 
justification in violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  MetTel also argues 
that the agency improperly terminated the task order under which the protester provides 
telecommunications services to SSA.  
 We dismiss the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 MetTel currently provides telecommunications services, including toll -free services, to 
SSA pursuant to task order No. 28321320FDX030010, issued under the General Services Administration  (GSA) Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions  (EIS) schedule DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO protective order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.

Access Management) Task Order at  1, 36.2  The task order, issued on February 4, 
2020, and referred to as the Grand SLLAM task order, was the result of SSA’s 
consolidation of telephony services contract vehicles and locally purchased services into a single EIS task order.  Id. at 36.  The task order has a base period of 1- year and 
up to 12 option years; the most recent option year is set to end on February  3, 2026.  Id. 
at 9-10.   
 As relevant to this protest, under the Grand SLLAM task order, SSA pays MetTel  for the 
agency’s actual use of toll -free services and is not required to obtain the services 
exclusively from MetTel.  Id. at 17-35, 98- 99; see also Contracting Officer’s Statement 
and Memorandum of Law  (COS/MOL) at 6.  On March 21, 2025, MetTel contacted the 
agency and noted that it had just been informed that “all Toll -Free services are moving 
away from MetTel and are moving to [Amazon Web Services  (AWS)].”  Protest exh. A, 
Emails Between Protester and Agency, Mar. 21- 25, 2025 at 3 (quoting protester’s 
request to meet with the agency to discuss service changes); see also Protest at 3- 4.  
Although MetTel pressed SSA for more information about the change, none was forthcoming.  
 On March 25, MetTel filed a protest with our Office complaining that SSA had partially cancelled its contract to provide toll -free services and made a sole- source award to 
AWS without publicizing or justifying its decision.  Protest at  4-6.  During development of 
the protest, SSA advised that it is currently obtaining the required toll -free services 
through an existing blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) for AWS cloud computing 
services with Four Points Technology LLC  (Four Points).  First Req. for Dismissal, 
Apr. 4, 2025 at 2.  SSA explained that it established BPA No.  28321321A00040003 with 
Four Points on December  22, 2020, to provide the agency with access to “commercial 
cloud service providers  (CSP) to support the development and delivery of business 
services to the public and SSA technicians,” including AWS.  See AR, Exh.  1, Four

cloud and cloud- related IT professional services.  AR, Exh.  4, Four Points GSA 
Schedule at  1, 4; see also Second Req. for Dismissal at  6-7; COS/MOL at 4.  On

learning that the agency had issued a task order for the Amazon Connect services  to 
Four Points, MetTel filed a supplemental protest.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
MetTel raises multiple arguments concerning SSA ’s acquisition of its required toll -free 
services.  Initially, MetTel argues that the agency had partially cancelled its contract to 
provide toll -free service and made a sole- source award to AWS without publicizing or 
justifying its decision.  Protest at  4-6.  After the agency clarified that it had issued a task 
order to Four Points, not AWS, MetTel further argues that SSA improperly issued the task order to Four Points because the Amazon Connect services exceed the scope of Four Points’s GSA schedule contract for cloud computing and Four Points is ineligible to provide toll -free services because it is not a registered provider in accordance with 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations .  Supp. Protest at  4-5.   
 The agency requests that our Office dismiss all of MetTel’s initial protest grounds, arguing that they are legally insufficient and involve matters of contract administration over which GAO does not exercise jurisdiction.  First Req. for Dismissal at  4-7.  SSA 
also argues that we should dismiss MetTel’s supplemental protest on the basis that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points and that MetTel raises matters of contract administration.  Second Req. for Dismissal at  3-4, 
9-10; COS/MOL at 9- 10.  W e dismiss the protest grounds as discussed below.

 Contract Administration  
 We first address MetTel’s allegations that the SSA has improperly cancelled portions of its contract to provide telecommunications services, including toll -free services.  Protest 
at 4-6.  In its request for dismissal, the agency argues that MetTel’s compl aint about the 
reduction in MetTel’s services is “a pure contract administration matter” over which GAO 
 
3 Throughout the record the terms “AWS Connect” and “Amazon Connect” are used 
interchangeably when discussing the AWS product for a CCaaS, which is a virtual contact center.  See AR, Exh. 7, AWS Amazon Connect Documentation Website at  1. 
4 While we do not address every argument raised in this protest , we have reviewed 
each issue and do not find any basis to sustain the protest.   The agency also raises 
additional grounds for dismissal of the protest.  Because we agree with the agency that 
the protester is not an interested party to challenge Four Points’s task order award, we 
need not resolve the alternative asserted bases for dismissal.   Page 4 B-423414; B -423414.2  has no jurisdiction.  First Req. for Dismissal at 7.  We agree with the agency and 
dismiss these protest allegations on that basis.   
 Our Office considers bid protest challenges to the award or proposed award of contracts.  31 U.S.C. § 3552.

one of a few exceptions to this rule, w e will, however, review the propriety of a contract 
termi nation where it flows from a defect that the contracting agency perceived in the 
award process.  In such cases, we examine the award procedures that underlie the termination action for the limited purpose of determining whether the initial award was improper and, if so, whether the corrective action taken is proper.

Connected, Inc. , B‑416324, June 11, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 208 at 6 (delineating the limited 
situations where GAO reviews protest grounds challenging contract termination).  
 This exception is inapplicable here.  The record shows that SSA pays for the toll -free 
services used under the Grand SLLAM task order contract with MetTel.  AR, Exh . 9, 
Grand SLLAM Task Order at  17-35; 98- 99; see also COS/MOL at  9-10.  SSA is not 
obligated to use the contract with MetTel as the only means of obtaining the toll -free 
services it needs.  Moreover, MetTel has not alleged SSA decreased its usage of toll -
free services because of a perceived defect with the award of the initial Grand SLLAM task or der to MetTel.  Accordingly, any reduction of MetTel’s toll -free services is a 
matter of contract administration and we dismiss this protest ground because it raises 
an issue GAO will not consider.    Insufficient Protest Allegations  
 Next, the protester argues that the agency improperly awarded a sole- source contract to 
AWS for toll -free services in violation of FAR parts 5 and 6, which require publication of 
contract actions and documented justification for a non- competitive award, respectively.  
Protest at  4-6.  In response, SSA requests dismissal of the protest because MetTel is 
mistaken about the contract vehicle the agency is using to procure the toll -free services.  
In this connection, the agency advises that in August 2024, it is sued a task order to 
Four Points, not AWS, for Amazon Connect, a cloud computing service, under an existing BPA established with Four Points for access to commercial cloud computing services.  First Req. for Dismissal at  2, 4-6.  The agency argues that Met Tel’s protest 
grounds do not state a valid basis for protest because they are based on an incorrect contract awardee and are therefore legally and factually insufficient.  Id. at 4-6.  We 
agree.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations require a protester to include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4), (f).  That is, a protest must include sufficient f actual 
bases to establish a reasonable potential that the protester’s allegations may have  Page 5 B-423414; B -423414.2  merit.  Chags Health Info. Tech., LLC , B-420940.3 et al. , Dec. 14, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 315 at 5.  Where a protester’s allegations are based on speculation, factual 
inaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions, GAO will summarily dismiss the protest 
without requiring the agency to submit a report.  4 C.F.R. § 21.5; Excelsior Ambulance Serv., Inc ., B-421948, Sept.  27, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 220 at 3.  
 The record demonstrates that MetTel’s protest was based on faulty facts and a flawed legal assumption.  SSA established a BPA with Four Points in December 2020 for access to commercial cloud computing services.  In August 2024, pursuant to the BPA, the agency issued a task order to Four Points for Amazon Connect, a CCaaS that includes providing toll -free services to the agency.  SSA did not make a sole- source 
award to AWS for toll -free services.  Because this protest ground is based on inaccurate 
factual as sertions, we dismiss it as failing to state a valid basis for protest.  
 Interested Party  
 MetTel  also challenges SSA’s issuance of the task order to Four Points and asserts that 
the toll -free services are outside the scope of Four Points’s GSA schedule contract.  
Specifically, MetTel argues that Four Points’s GSA schedule contract allows it “to resel l 
specific IT hardware and software licenses and services to the federal government,” but that the specified items do not include the toll -free services that MetTel provides to SSA.  
Supp. Protest at 3- 5.  The protester also argues that SSA’s contract with Four Points 
violates FCC regulations because operators of toll -free services are required to be 
registered with the FCC and Four Points is not.  Id.   
 
The agency requests dismissal of this protest ground, arguing that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points because MetTel is not “an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.”  Second Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4 (quoting the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, 
31 U.S.C. §  3551(2) ).   
 The agency contends that MetTel  has not alleged it competed for the BPA established 
with Four Points in 2020 or that MetTel was even eligible to compete for the BPA.  Id. at 3.  In this connection, SSA contends that the protester would be ineligible for award if 
its protest were to be sustained because MetTel does not have a GSA schedule contract that includes access to AWS commercial cloud computing services, including Amazon Connect.  Id. at 4.  The agency contends that the protester cannot show that 
the agency’s award of the task order to Four Points directly affects the protester’s economic interest, and therefore, the protester is not an interested party.  Id.  
 In response, the protester concedes that it did not participate in the BPA competition and that it does not have a GSA schedule contract for access to commercial cloud computing services.  Comments at 12- 13.  MetTel nonetheless argues that it has an 
econom ic interest because SSA’s use of MetTel’s services has decreased as a result of 
the agency’s task order award to Four Points.  Id.  Page 6 B-423414; B -423414.2   
Under the bid protest provisions of CICA, only an “interested party” may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. §  3551(2) ; 4 C.F.R. § 21.0(a).  That is, a protester must 
be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract.  4 C.F.R. § 21.0(a).  Determining whether a party is interested involves consideration of a variety of factors, including the nature of the issues raised, the benefit or relief sought by the protester, and the party’s status in relation to the procurement.

 On this record, we find that the protester has not shown, or even alleged, that it is a prospective offeror eligible to compete for a task order for the Amazon Connect services sought by the agency.  We also find that MetTel’s economic interest in the proc urement 
is too remote.  In this connection, MetTel argues it has a direct economic interest in the procurement because the agency is using less of its services due to the Four Points task order.  While the volume of services that the agency orders under it s existing task 
order with MetTel may be impacted by SSA’s issuance of the task order to Four Points, this is not the kind of direct economic interest contemplated by our Bid Protest Regulations.  See Intellectix Corp. , B-420552 et al. , May 27, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  135 at 6 
(concluding protester ’s economic interest is too remote for the firm to be considered an 
interested party to challenge the agency’s task order award when the protester does not 
hold the requisite schedule contract) .  MetTel has admitted it does not have a GSA 
schedule contract for cloud computing services (special item number 518210C) and it is incapable of providing SSA with the Amazon Connect services required so SSA is unable to issue a task order to MetTel for the requirement.  Because MetTel would not be eligible for contract award even if its protest is sustained, we conclude that MetTel is not an interested party to pursue a protest of SSA’s issuance of a task order to Four Points.

Exh. 6.1, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 1; RFQ at 48.   
 
The RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to 
evaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past 
performance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach 
factor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflict s of interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and 
risk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal 
importance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   
 Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  
 
The [vendor] ’s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the 
Government can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  Therefore, 
the [vendor] ’s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of spelling and 
grammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the Government will 
expect from awardees.  The [vendor] ’s ability to  follow the instructions contained 
herein is a demonstration of the [vendor] ’s ability to  follow instructions in general, 
which is paramount to acceptable performance.  
 The [vendor]’ s attention to detail is important to the Government as a significant 
amount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work statement] will 
require the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including quality control.  If a[] 
[vendor] ’s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not following the directions 
contained herein, the [vendor] ’s quot [ation] shall be ineligible for award.  
 Id. at 47.  
 The RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation stated that in the quotations, “[i]llustrations may be placed as an imbedded picture, as long as the picture does not contain text.”  Id. at 51.  The RFQ 
also invited potential vendors to ask questions.  One vendor asked the agency to confirm that the instructions regarding illustrations and pictures without text “does not pertain to the cover page” because “[c]over pages typically contain b randing elements 
for companies including different fonts and pictures which may have text ( e.g., logos).”  
AR, Exh. 6.5, Questions and Answers (Q&A) at 9.  In response, the agency stated:  “Do not include branding information as a picture if it includes text.  Instead include your company information in accordance with the solicitation instructions. ”  Id. 
 
 
1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274  The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the 
formatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  
 
[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or deficient and will 
be considered ineligible for award.  
 
* * * * * 
 
A quote will be deemed unacceptable if it does not . . . comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this solicitation.  
RFQ. at 51, 64.  
 The solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  
 
A deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of the 
Request for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or unacceptable 
within this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  [vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is 
determined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s are cautioned to ensure all the 
solicitation requirements are met.   [Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention 
to the details of this solicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] ’s ability to follow explicit 
instructions is critical to the performance of the resulting orders from this 
award.  
 A quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .”  
 
* * * * * 
 
A failure to provide the information called for .  . .  or a failure to provide the 
information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . .  The evaluation of a[n]  [Vendor] ’s quot [ation]  will end upon a 
determination that  the [Vendor] ’s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  
 Id. at 63-64. 
 The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s 
to determine whether quotations  were “compliant with the criteria and instructions of the 
RFQ,” unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law 
(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 10.2, Notice of Elimination.     Page 4 B-423274  As part of its submission, FIC’s quotation included its corporate logo on the cover page 
of each of its quotation volumes.  Protest at 3.  The corporate logo was a picture that spelled out “FI CONSULTING.”  Id.   After the initial compliance review of FIC’s 
quotation, the agency determined that the quotation failed to comply with the RFQ’s formatting instructions because FIC’s “cover pages contain images with text (Branding Images).”  AR, Exh. 10.2, Notice of Eli mination.   The use of pictures with text was not 
permissible under the RFQ’s instructions.  RFQ at 51.  Upon notification of its elimination, FIC filed this protest on January 9, 2025.   
 DISCUSSION  FIC asserts that the agency improperly excluded its quotation due to a latent  ambiguity 
in the solicitation’s formatting instructions that prohibited the inclusion of text with pictures.  Protest at 4; Comments at 1.  The protester alleges that a reasonable 
interpretation of the formatting instructions is that the prohibition did not apply to company logos.  Protest at 5.  In the alternative, protester argues that the agency was 
required under FAR section 14.405 to waive the error as a minor informality.  Id. at 6.  
For the reasons explained below, we find that the solicitation was not ambiguous and the agency reasonably eliminated the protester’s quotation in accordance with the 
solicitation’s instructions.  
 Quotation Formatting Requirements  
 The protester does not dispute that its quotation included its corporate logo, which was a picture with text, but rather alleges that the solicitation instructions for pictures were 
latently ambiguous.  Comments at 1.  Specifically, FIC explains that the formatting instructions that prohibit pictures with text did not apply to company logos because inclusion of its company name does not include text intended for “[a]gency review as part of its evaluation”  of FIC’s quotation.  Protest at 5; Comments at 1.  I n this regard, 
the protester explains that the solicitation instructions regarding “text” in pictures are included with instructions for “page margins, font size, and line spacing.”  Protest at 4.  The protester argues that the agency’s intent was that vendors not use “illustrations” or “pictures” with text to “circumvent the [s]olicitation’s instructions regarding margins, font size and line spacing.”  Protest at 4; Comments at 2.  FIC contends that its interpretation of the formatting instructions should be accepted as “reasonable.”  Protest at 5.    The agency contends it properly eliminated FIC’s quotation because the protester included a picture with text on the cover page in “all four volumes” and thus “ignored the solicitation requirement” and the agency response as part of the Q&A process.

that the protester’s “interpretation fails because based on the plain language of the RFQ

to assume that the RFQ requirements regarding text in images did not apply to an [vendor]’s logo or that the RFQ requirement did not apply to cover pages.”  MOL at 3.  
 Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation 
must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 163 at 5.  An

 As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for pictures, specifically stating that “ . . . Illustrations may be placed as an imbedded picture, as long as the 
picture does not contain text .”  RFQ at 51.   Moreover, the agency clarified formatting 
requirements for pictures.  In response to a vendor’s question regarding whether it was permissible to include company logos on quotation cover pages, the agency explained, “[d]o not include branding information as a picture if it includes text.  Instead include 
your company  information in accordance with the solicitation instructions .”  COS at 4; 
AR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A at 9.  Stated otherwise, the solicitation instructions and agency 
response to the question both cautioned that pictures should not contain text.   
 On this record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity as alleged by the protester.  FIC’s interpretation that company logos including text were exempt from the picture formatting requirements is incompatible with the solicitation instructions.  The protester ’s interpretation ignores the solicitation language, highlighted in bold font, that 
explained that pictures should not contain text.  RFQ at 51.  To the extent this language did not make the agency’s requirements plain, the agency’s response, during the Q&A process, that “branding information” should not include text if provided as a picture, foreclosed the protester’s alternative interpretation.  AR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A at 9.  On these facts, we conclude that the protester's interpretation of the solicitation was not reasonable and that, therefore, no ambiguity exists.   
 Moreover, as explained above, t he RFQ included several sections which emphasized 
that failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a 
“deficiency ,” which mandated elimination from competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  In 
response to the protest, the agency explains that these instructions were intentionally included in bold font  to draw attention to these requirements.   COS at 4.  In this regard,  
the contracting officer states that the solicitation “was designed to select only thos e  Page 6 B-423274  contractors capable of following detailed instructions” and that the RFQ “states the 
importance of a [vendor’s] ability to follow detailed instructions.”  For these reasons, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as “must” and “shall” instead of discretionary terms such as “may” which was an “intentional and deliberate deviation” from previous solicitations that was “made to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor’s] 
ability to follow directions.”  Id. at 2.   
 On this record, we find FIC’s interpretation of the RFQ to be unreasonable, and the agency’s elimination of FIC’s quotation to be reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Consequently, this protest ground is denied.  
 Waiver of Minor Informalities  
 In the alternative, the protester argues that the agency should have waived FIC’s failure to follow solicitation instructions as a minor informality under FAR section 14.405.  Protest at 6.  The protester argues that including its company logo on the quotation cover pages did not permit FIC to have more space for quotation content than other vendors.  Id .  Furthermore, the “deviation” was “minor and immaterial,” and inclusion of 
its quotation only serves to benefit the agency with increased competition.  I d.   
 In response, the agency argues that the “ability or inability to conform to the easy and clearly stated RFQ instruction is a material component of the RFQ to [en]sure that the [vendors] that received the award can deliver the quality of work that is expected under this BPA.”  MOL at 4 -5.  Furthermore, the agency asserts that waiver of FIC’s error is 
contradictory to the RFQ’s purpose and unfair to vendors who foll owed solicitation 
instructions.  Id. at 5.     
 The protester has failed to allege a cognizable basis of protest because the protester’s reliance on FAR section 14.405 is misplaced.
3  Section 14.405 of the FAR applies to 
sealed bidding procedures under FAR part 14 and therefore is not applicable to the federal supply schedule procedures used here under FAR subpart 8.4.  As such, the protester’s contention that the agency was required to ignore or waive the minor and immaterial errors fails to state adequate legal grounds of protest.  4 C.F.R. §  21.5(f);

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest alleging that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity  is denied where the 
protester ’s interpretation of the relevant solicitation language is not reasonable.  
 2.  Protest alleging that the agency should have waived the protester’s quotation error 
as a minor informality is dismissed where the agency was not required to waive minor informalities under Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 8.4.  
DECISION  
 FI Consulting, Inc. (FIC), a small business of Arlington, Virginia, protests the elimination of its quotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the 
Department of  Agriculture (USDA)  for program support to various USDA missions, 
including farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency improperly eliminated its  quotation based on ambiguous solicitation formatting 
instructions and in the alternative, the agency should have waived the protester’s failure to follow solicitation instructions as a minor informality.    
 We deny the protest in part and dismiss it in part.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through t he General Services 
Administration’s  electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the 
federal supply schedule procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 
8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Edh. 4.1, RFQ at 47-48 ; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject 
to a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2 B-423274  Compliance Review at 1.1  The solicitation contemplated the establishment of a multiple 
award, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year period of performance.  AR, 
Exh. 6.1, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 1; RFQ at 48.   
 
The RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to 
evaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past 
performance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach 
factor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflict s of interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and 
risk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal 
importance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   
 Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:

 The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s 
to determine whether quotations  were “compliant with the criteria and instructions of the

DECISION  
 
Quantum Research International, Inc., a small business of Huntsville, Alabama, protests 
the issuance of a task order to PeopleTec, Inc., a small business also of Huntsville, Alabama, under task order requirement package (TORP) No.  24-005, issued by the 
Department of the Army for program management, scientific, engineering, logistics, financial, and ancillary services in support of the agency’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO).  The protester contends that the agency’s corrective action in response to a previously -filed protest was unreasonable; 
PeopleTec’s proposal contained a material misrepresentation requiring its disqualification from the competition; the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec’s DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.

analysis was unreasonable, inadequately documented, and improperly used a 
lowest -priced, technically acceptable source selection method.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On May  20, 2024, the agency issued the TORP pursuant to the fair opportunity source 
selection procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5 to small 
business firms holding indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts under 
small business pool  4 of the General Services Administration’s One Acquisition Solution 
for Integrated Services program.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at  1; Agency 
Report (AR), Tab 26, Amended TORP at  1.  The TORP, which the agency amended six 
times, sought proposals to pr ovide services in support of rapid prototyping efforts and 
the delivery of residual combat capabilities that address immediate, near -term, and 
mid-term threats faced by Army operational units.  COS at  2; AR, Tab  20, Amended 
Performance Work Statement (PWS) at  3.  The agency refers to the task order to be 
issued as the RCCTO Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Support (SETA) task order.  
 The TORP contemplated issuance of  a single cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a 
3-year base period and one 2- year option on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering 
four factors:  task execution; qualifications and experience; past performance; and cost/price .  COS at  1-2; Amended TORP at  3, 16-17.  The task execution factor was 
more important than the qualifications and experience factor, which was more important than the past performance factor.  Amended TORP at  17.  The past performance factor , 
in turn,  was more important than cost/price.  Id.  The non- cost/price factors, when 
combined, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  
 Relevant to the protester’s allegations, the TORP’s instructions for  the past performance 
factor directed offerors to identify no more than five contracts performed by the offeror or a major subcontractor --defined as a subcontractor proposed to perform 10 percent or 
more of the effort --that were relevant to the competed requirement and either current or 
completed within the last five years.  Id.  at 9.  Offerors were to provide a narrative 
describing how each effort was similar to the requirement, as well as  a crosswalk 
between each effort and the PWS.  Id.  at 9-10.  The TORP further provided that the 
agency, at its discretion, could assess “recent and relevant performance data obtained from other [g]overnment data sources .  . . as they relate to the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) codes 541715,  541330, 541712 or other relevant codes.”  
Id. at 18. 
 With respect to the evaluation of past performance, the TORP stated that the agency would “evaluate the offeror’s record of recent and relevant performance history which must provide the [agency] a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.”  Id.  To meet the recency requirement, the TORP required  Page 3    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   the effort to have been performed within the past five years and stated that if 
performance had not occurred within the previous five years, the effort “will be considered to not meet the requirement as related to recency.”  Id. 
 The TORP stated that the agency would “evaluate if the submitted [p]ast [p]erformance is relevant based upon the ratings outlined” below:  
 
Rating  Description  
Very Relevant  Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same 
scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation 
requires.  
Relevant  Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and 
magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  
Somewhat 
Relevant  Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and 
magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  
Not Relevant  Present/past performance involved little or none of the scope and 
magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  
 Id. at 18, 21- 22.  The TORP further defined “relevant” as follows:  
 
Relevant is defined as federal contractual efforts that are similar to the requirements specified in the solicitation in terms of scope (performance requirements/contractual aspects), magnitude (dollar value), and complexity as indicated by performance that (i)  primarily involved the 
management of large subcontracting teams (i.e. more than 5 team 
members or subcontractors) in performing engineering services, [p]rogram management support, test and evaluation activities, financial management activities, and security support similar to that required by the PWS, (ii) represented a total potential value of at least $20M annually (applicable 
to prime offerors only), and (iii) was executed under a cost -type contract 
(applicable to prime offerors only).  
 
Id. at 18-19. 
 Finally, the TORP stated that the agency would assess the quality of the offeror’s recent and relevant performance record, “focus[ing] on whether the performance met contract requirements, the frequency of performance problems, and the effectiveness of corrective action taken by the contractor.”  Id.  at 19.  The agency “reserve[d] the right to 
use data provided by the offeror in its proposal[;] data obtained from interviews with cognizant [g]overnment personnel having knowledge of the offeror’s performance;  data 
obtained from applicable contract files; and/or data obtained from other sources such as the [Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past 
Performance Information Retrieval System, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity 
Informa tion System,] or other [g]overnmental databases.”  Id.  
  Page 4    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   The TORP provided that the agency would assign a confidence rating under the past 
performance factor in accordance with the following definitions:  
 
Rating  Description  
Substantial 
Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has a high expectation that the offeror will 
successfully perform the required effort.  
Satisfactory 
Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort.  
Neutral Confidence  No recent/relevant performance record is available or the 
offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.  The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on 
the factor of past  performance.  
Limited Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has a low expectation that the offeror will 
successfully perform the required effort.  
No Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has no expectation that the offeror will be 
able to successfully perform the required effort.  
 Id. at 22. 
 The agency received proposals from six offerors, including the protester and PeopleTec , by the TORP’s closing date of August  16, 2024.  COS at  2.  On 
December  4, the agency issued a task order to PeopleTec, and the protester 
subsequently filed a protest with our Office on December  17, alleging that the agency 
erred in its evaluation and that PeopleTec materially misrepresented its corporate experience.  Id. at 5-6; Quantum Rsch. Int’l, Inc., B -423237, Jan.  16, 2025 (unpublished 
decision).   Thereafter, the agency advised that it would reevaluate proposals and make 
a new award decision, as well as tak e any other appropriate action consistent with 
procurement regulations, and we therefore dismissed the protest as academic.  Quantum Rsch. , supra .  While the protester objected to dismissal on the ground that the 
agency did not specifically represent that it would investigate the alleged material misrepresentation, we concluded that the protester’s objection merely anticipated improper action by the agency, as the agency had not represented that it would not investigate or consider the alleged material misrepresentation in its reevaluation.  Id.  
 As discussed further below, during the reevaluation of  proposals, the agency requested 
additional informati on from both the protester and PeopleTec regarding past contracts 
submitted as part of their respective proposals, including the effort about which the protester had alleged PeopleTec’s proposal contained a material misrepresentation.  COS at  6-7, 9.  Upon completing the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following 
adjectival ratings to the proposals submitted by the protester and PeopleTec:

AR, Tab  63, Task Order Decision Document (TODD) at  6. 
 In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that PeopleTec’s proposal was superior under the task execution factor, which was the most important under the TORP’s terms, because it presented additional strengths that the protester’s proposal did not also offer.  Id.  at 30-31.  The agency further concluded that the protester’s 
proposal was superior under the qualifications and experience and past performance factors.  Id. at 30.  While the agency concluded that the protester’s proposal overall was 
technically superior to PeopleTec’s proposal, it  further determined that the protester’s 
proposal was not sufficiently advantageous to merit the associated price premium.  Id.  
at 33.  The agency therefore determined that PeopleTec’s proposal offered the best 
value to the agency, and consequently issued the task order to PeopleTec.  Id.  at 33-34. 
 This protest followed.

 DISCUSSION 
 
The protester contends that PeopleTec’s  proposal contained a material 
misrepresentation regarding PeopleTec’s role on a past performance effort , and  that the 
agency therefore was required to disqualify PeopleTec from the competition.  Relatedly, 
the protester alleges that the agency’s corrective action in response to the previous protest was unreasonable, arguing that the agency failed to reasonably investigate that alleged misrepresentation.  The protester further alleges that the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec’s proposal under the past performance factor.  Lastly, the protester contends that the agency’s best -value tradeoff determination was 
unreasonable, inadequately documented, and not in accordance with the TORP’s 
 
1 As the total evaluated cost/price of the task order at issue here exceeds $10 million, 
this procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under civilian agency IDIQ contracts.  41 U.S.C. §  4106(f)(1)(B).  Page 6    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   terms .  For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that there is no basis on which to 
sustain the protest.2 
 
Material Misrepresentation and Corrective Action  Two of the protester’s allegations center around a task order --referred to as Mission 
Planning, Advance Decision Support Data Analytics Tools, and Cyber Hardening – 
Secure Environment Contract (MATCH SEC) --that was performed by CybEx , LLC, a 
joint venture (JV) formed by the protester and PeopleTec.
3  In the past performance 
volume of its proposal, PeopleTec described its role on MATCH SEC in relevant part as 
follows:  
 
PeopleTec, a JV member during [task order] execution, performs as the 
[task order] lead--managing nine different projects being performed for 
[U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command], [U.S. Space Force], 82nd Airborne Division, [Federal Bureau of Investigation], [Office of the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and 
Technology ,] and other customers, each requiring different technical skill 
sets.  . . . Leading MATCH SEC with the complexities of multiple 
customers and projects, and five subcontractors has equipped PeopleTec 
with the experience and expertise to support RCCTO and its project offices as a prime contractor.

The debriefing provided to the protester after the agency’s initial source selection 
decision in December  2024 discussed the agency’s evaluation of MATCH SEC as part 
of the protester ’s--not PeopleTec’s --proposal, stating that the agency had found the 
contract to be “similar in scope and magnitude as [ Quantum ] managed a $77M task 
order as the managing partner of a Joint Venture[.]”  Protest at  7.  As Quantum ’s 
proposal had not included any discussion of MATCH SEC, the protester raised concerns about the debr iefing statement in its follow- up questions.  Id.  at 8.  The agency 
responded that it had “inadvertently mis -reference[d] a finding from another proposal 
with Quantum’s submission.”  Id.   This response then formed the factual basis of the

protester’s allegations and variations thereof, we have reviewed them all and concluded 
that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  
3 In February  2024, t he protester and PeopleTec resolved  a lawsuit arising out of a 
dispute regarding PeopleTec’s invocation of a “shootout” provision in CybEx ’s operating 
agreement allowing either member to require the other member to elect to buy or sell its ownership interest at a specified price.  Protest, app.  at A_18- A_19 (First Decl. of

on MATCH SEC because the protester, not PeopleTec, was the managing member of CybEx  and therefore responsible for managing MATCH SEC performance.  AR, Tab 45, 
Previous Protest at  9-10. 
 As discussed above, we dismissed the previously -filed protest as academic after the 
agency indicated that it would take corrective action.  As part of that corrective action--which also included the reevaluation of proposals --the agency asked PeopleTec 
to answer the following questions:  
 
1.  Was PeopleTec a participating member of the Cybex JV during the performance of the MATCH SEC Task Order?  2.  Did PeopleTec serve as a Task Order Lead for the MATCH SEC T ask 
Order?  
 3.  Did the MATCH SEC Task Order involve performance requirements which align to the RCCTO SETA Support TORP 24- 005 PWS paragraphs 
[DELETED] ? 
 4.  Did PeopleTec personnel perform on MATCH SEC [task order] requirements which map to each of these RCCTO SETA Support TORP 24-005 PWS paragraphs ( [DELETED] )? 
 5.  Did PeopleTec’s Support under the MATCH SEC Task Order include 
management of five subcontractor Vendors in performance of the Task Order?

those questions.  AR, Tab 52, PeopleTec Clarification Resp.  at 1. 
 In the instant protest, the protester renews its contention that PeopleTec  
misrepresented its role on MATCH SEC.   Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 8-13; Supp. Comments at  4-10.  In particular, the protester argues that PeopleTec 
could not truthfully state that it  managed subcontractors on MATCH SEC because the 
protester, not PeopleTec, was the managing member of CybEx .  Protest at  11; 
Comments & Supp. Protest at  9-10; Supp. Comments at  6-10.  The protester further 
contends that PeopleTec’s responses to the agency’s questions also misrepresented PeopleTec’s role on MATCH SEC for similar reasons.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 12-13; Supp. Comments at  4-10.  The protester argues that these statements 
constituted material misrepresentations requiring PeopleTec’s disqualification from the competition.  Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp. Protest at  14-16; Supp. Comments 
at 10.  The agency and intervenor respond that PeopleTec’s proposal did not state that 
PeopleTec was CybEx ’s managing member or otherwi se misrepresent PeopleTec’s role 
on MATCH SEC, and, furthermore, that the agency’s consideration of PeopleTec’s performance on MATCH SEC  did not have a significant impact upon the evaluation.   Page 8    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  28-33; Supp. MOL at  24-46; Intervenor Comments

We have recognized that an offeror’s material misrepresentation can provide a basis for the disqualification of a proposal and cancellation of a contract award based upon the proposal.  A misrepresentation is material where an agency relied upon the misrep resentation and that misrepresentation likely had a significant impact upon the 
evaluation.  Avar Consulting, Inc. , B-417668.3 et al. , June 10, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 191 
at 9.  Our decisions have been clear that, where an alleged misrepresentation had no 
effect  on the evaluation, that misrepresentation was not material and does not implicate 
the validity of the award decision.  Insight Tech. Sols., Inc. , B-417388, B -417388.2, 
June 19, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 239 at  5. 
 The parties have vigorously disputed whether PeopleTec misrepresent ed its role on 
MATCH SEC.  They have skirmished as to the meaning of “manage” and “lead” as those terms are used in PeopleTec’s proposal  to describe the nature of its 
responsibilities and performance under MATCH SEC .  See Protest at  11-12; MOL 
at 20-21; Comments & Supp. Protest at  6-7, 9-11; Intervenor Comments at  4-5; Supp. 
MOL at  15, 17- 18, 34- 36; Supp. Comments at  5, 7-8; Intervenor Supp. Comments at  3.  
The protester and agency have debated the applicability and import  of the terms of 
CybEx ’s operating agreement.  See  MOL at  28-29, 32; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 2-4, 10- 11; Supp. MOL at  24-30; Supp. Comments at  3, 6-7.  And the protester and 
intervenor have collectively proffered several  declarations regarding CybEx ’s 
operations, the protester ’s and intervenor’s respective roles therein, and their  
responsibilities performed under MATCH SEC.  See  Protest, app.  at A_16- A_24 (First 
Decl. of Quantum Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )), A_610- A_615 (Second Decl. of 
Quantum CEO); Comments & Supp. Protest, exh.  1, Third Decl. of Quantum CEO; 
Intervenor Comments, exh.  1, Decl. of PeopleTec’s Chief Operating Officer.   We need 
not--and do not --wade into the morass of questions of semantics, corporate 
governance, and competing accounts that the parties have provided, however, as the record demonstrates that  the alleged misrepresentation did not have a significant 
impact  on the evaluation of PeopleTec’s past performance.  
 PeopleTec’s proposal included information regarding five efforts , two performed by 
PeopleTec and three performed respectively by its two proposed major subcontractors .  
AR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3-7.  In conducting its 
reevaluation of proposals, t he agency first concluded that each of those efforts met the 
TORP’s recency requirement.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation 
at 3-4.  After reviewing the scope, magnitude, and complexity of each effort, the agency 
assigned them the following relevancy ratings:  
  Page 9    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Effort  Performing Entity  Relevancy Rating  
Reference No. 1 PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  
MATCH SEC  PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  
Reference No. 3 Subcontractor 1  Somewhat Relevant  
Reference No. 4 Subcontractor 1  Relevant  
Reference No. 5 Subcontractor 2  Relevant  
 
Id. at 4-6. 
 In assigning relevancy ratings, the agency noted that PeopleTec’s first three references --including MATCH SEC--had annual values below $20 million,
5 involved 
services similar to  some of the PWS’s requirements, and, while the first two involved the 
management of subcontractors, they  did not involve the management of more than five 
subcontractors.  Id. at 4-5.  Consequently, the agency concluded that these references  
involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP and assigned ratings of somewhat relevant to th em.  Id.  By contrast, the agency 
noted that the remaining two references had annual values well in excess of $20 million, 
involved services similar to some or most of the PWS’s requirements, and involved the management of substantially more than five subcontractors.  Id.  at 5-6.  The agency 
therefore concluded that they involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP, assigning ratings of relevant to those references.  Id. 
 The agency then assigned an overall relevancy rating of somewhat relevant, noting that because PeopleTec’s proposed subcontractors had performed the fourth and fifth references , PeopleTec  itself did not possess any fully relevant past performance as a 
prime contractor.  Id. at 6.  Nevertheless, the agency concluded, PeopleTec’s past 
efforts collectively “span[ned] the entirety of the RCCTO PWS” and therefore merited a rating of somewhat relevant.  Id.  Because of “previous litigation invoking the MATCH 
SEC effort,” i.e., the previously -filed protest, t he contracting officer  also “considered 
whether PeopleTec adequately demonstrated sufficient past performance without considering the MATCH SEC effort .”  Id.  Excluding MATCH SEC, the contracting officer 
concluded that  PeopleTec ’s proposal nevertheless  had demonstrated sufficient past 
performance because of the collective experience shown by its other efforts.  Id. 
 In assessing the quality of PeopleTec’s performance, the agency queried CPARS to locate performance assessments  for each reference.  Id.  at 6-8.  Notably, there were 
multiple performance assessments available for each of PeopleTec’s references except for MATCH SEC, for which CPARS did not contain any assessments.  Id.   For that 
 
5 As discussed above, the agency’s debriefing to the protester containing the mistaken 
reference to MATCH SEC characterized that task order as having a value of $77 million, 
but PeopleTec’s proposal and the agency’s evaluation make clear that its annual value 
is $17.5 million.  See  AR, Tab 44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3; Tab 55, 
PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  5.  Page 10    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   effort, the only performance data available to the agency were statements from the 
contracting officer’s representative (COR)  in response to the agency’s inquiry , who 
stated that CybEx  “performed well on the effort and there were no noted performance 
issues.”  Id.  at 7.  The agency also reviewed all of the CPARS ratings for the previous 
five years for PeopleTec and its proposed major subcontractors, finding no adverse information.  Id. at 8.  Considering all of the past performance information, the agency 
determined that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance, and 
therefore assigned a rating of satisfactory confidence to PeopleTec’s proposal.  Id.  
 The agency and intervenor contend, in part, that the agency’s consideration of PeopleTec’s performance on MATCH SEC did not have a significant impact upon the evaluation, and that the alleged misrepresentation therefore was not material .  MOL 
at 32-33; Supp. MOL at  37-46; Intervenor Comments at  6-7; Intervenor Supp. 
Comments at  4-5.  On the record before us, we agree.   As an initial matter, the agency 
concluded that MATCH SEC, like all four of the other references, met the TORP’s recency requirements, and i ts relevancy rating of somewhat relevant is the same 
assigned to PeopleTec’s proposal overall under the past performance factor.  MATCH SEC also  was similar to the other two references the agency found to be somewhat 
relevant in that all three references had annual values below $20 million, involved 
services similar to some , but not most or all,  of the PWS’s requirements, and did not 
involve the management of more than five subcontractors.  
 The record also reflects that the agency considered MATCH SEC to be less relevant than the two references found to be relevant , which  had annual values over  $20 million, 
involved services similar to some or most of the PWS’s requirements, and involved the 
management of more than five subcontractors.   Furthermore, the crosswalk contained 
in PeopleTec’s proposal shows that, for each PWS paragraph to which MATCH SEC mapped, at least one other reference also mapped to that paragraph.  See  AR, Tab  44, 
PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9.  Thus, when viewed in context of all of 
PeopleTec’s past performance efforts, the record demonstrates that the agency’s consideration of MATCH SEC likely neither raised nor lowered the overall relevancy 
rating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec’s proposal.  
 Additionally, as noted above, the agency was able to review multiple CPARS assessments for each of PeopleTec’s past performance references, with the lone exception of MATCH SEC.  The overwhelming majority of the ratings for those assessments, which covered multiple performance periods, are either very good or 
exceptional.  See  AR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  6-8.  In 
contrast, the only information available to the agency regarding PeopleTec’s performance on MATCH SEC was the COR’s short , general  statement that CybEx  had 
performed well and that there were no noted performance issues.  Thus, there was substantially more performance information available to the agency regarding the non-MATCH SEC efforts, including multiple positive performance assessments 
regarding more relevant efforts.  
  Page 11    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In assigning a satisfactory confidence rating to PeopleTec’s proposal, the agency noted 
that PeopleTec “has presented somewhat relevant past performance information and there is clear demonstration of the offeror’s ability and its major subcontractor[s’] ability to perform somewhat similar work successfully through various CPARS  [assessments] .”  
Id. at 8.  In light of the evaluation finding that MATCH SEC was only somewhat relevant 
to the TORP’s requirements , the duplication in other references’ relevance t o the PWS 
requirements,  and the limited performance information regarding MATCH SEC that was 
available to the agency, that would remain a reasonable conclusion even if MATCH SEC were to be removed from the agency’s consideration, as the record of the evaluation of PeopleTec’s other past performance efforts wholly supports the agency’s 
evaluation of PeopleTec’s past performance .  Additionally, the agency’s comparison of 
the technical merits of the two proposals does not discuss MATCH SEC at all.  See  AR, 
Tab 63, TODD at  30-31. 
 On this record, we therefore conclude that the agency’s consideration of MATCH SEC 
had no significant impact  on the agency’s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating 
to PeopleTec’s proposal.   Cf. ValidaTek -CITI, LLC , B-418320.2 et al. , Apr.  22, 2020, 
2020 CPD ¶ 149 at  7-8 (denying allegation that awardee materially misrepresented its 
past performance where the rating “did not depend on the referenced contract at all”).   
Accordingly, we deny the material misrepresentation ground of protest  with respect  to 
both PeopleTec’s proposal and its responses to the agency’s questions regarding MATCH SEC.  
 For similar reasons, we deny the protester’s allegation that the agency’s questions to PeopleTec regarding MATCH SEC constituted unreasonable corrective action in 
response to the initial protest’s allegations of material misrepresentation, as the protester  cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prejudice.  Competitive 
prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest.  Computer World Servs. Corp. , 
B-421495.2, Dec.  6, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 280 at  7.  Where the protester fails to 
demonstrate that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have a substantial chance of receiving an award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Id.  at 7-8.  As discussed above, we conclude that the agency’s 
consideration of MATCH SEC had no significant impact  on the agency’s evaluation of 
PeopleTec’s  past performance.  Thus, to whatever extent the protester’s prior 
allegations of material misrepresentation warranted a more searching inquiry than that performed by the agency, the protester cannot demonstrate any reasonable probability of prejudice aris ing out of the agency’s failure to seek more information than that 
gleaned through its questions.
6  We therefore deny this ground of protest as well.  
 
6 While the protester contends that the agency should have disqualified PeopleTec from 
the competition prior to the reevaluation conducted as part of the agency’s corrective 
action, see Protest at  10; Comments & Supp. Protest at  7; Supp. Comments at  4, our 
decisions have concluded that “the mere fact that an agency identified a 
misrepresentation that it believes had a material influence on the agency’s evaluation of proposals does not obligate the agency to disqualify” the offeror.  Avar, supra at 10 n.8 
(quoting XYZ Corp. , B-413243.2, Oct.  18, 2016, 2016  CPD ¶ 296 at  6).  Page 12    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    
Past Performance  Next, the protester alleges that the agency improperly evaluated PeopleTec’s past performance, contending that the agency departed from the terms of the TORP in assigning ratings of somewhat relevant and satisfactory confidence to PeopleTec’s proposal.  Pr otest at  13-16; Comments & Supp. Protest at  16-35; Supp. Comments 
at 14-26.  The agency and intervenor respond that the agency’s evaluation was 
reasonable and consistent with the TORP’s terms.  MOL at  33-41; Supp. MOL at  46-77; 
Intervenor Comments at  9-13; Intervenor Supp. Comments at  8-15. 
 An agency’s evaluation of past performance, including its consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of an offeror’s performance history, is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.  Management and Tech. Servs. 
Alliance Joint Venture, B -422786 et al. , Nov.  6, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 264 at  5.  A 
protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment does not establish that a n 
evaluation w as unreasonable.  Id.  
 The protester first contends that the agency improperly assigned relevancy ratings of somewhat relevant to the two references in PeopleTec’s proposal performed by PeopleTec itself.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  17-21.  The protester argues that 
because the TORP defined “relevant” in terms of criteria the agency would use to assess similarity of scope, magnitude, and complexity, it set minimum requirements  that 
had to be met in order to merit a rating other than “not relevant.”   Thus, for example, the 
protest er contends that the rating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec’s first 
past performance reference was improper because, as the agency concluded, it  
(i) involve d the management of five--i.e., not more than five--subcontractors  in 
performing similar requirements; and (ii) ha d an annual value of $7.68 million --i.e., less 
than $20 million .  Id. at 17-18.  The agency responds that, under a plain reading, the 
TORP did not establish minimum criteria for relevance, and the agency’s assignment of somewhat relevant ratings was reasonable and in accordance with the TORP, as the references had some similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to the solicited requirement.  Supp. MOL at  53-56. 
 The protester’s argument rests upon an unreasonable reading of the TORP.  While the TORP laid out criteria against which the agency would evaluate past performance references for relevance, it also provided for the assessment of relevance on a scale.   
Thus, a reference involving “some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires” would merit  a rating of somewhat relevant  under 
the TORP’s terms , while a reference involving “similar scope and magnitude of effort 
and complex ities this solicitation requires” would merit a rating of relevant.  To find, as 
the protester urges, that the TORP’s criteria for scope, magnitude, and complexity were minimum requirements , a reference meeting all of those putatively minimum 
requirements necessarily would merit a rating of relevant, as it would involve “similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities”  as those terms are defined in the  Page 13    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   TORP,  not “some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities.”  In that way, 
the protester’s argument  would read the rating of somewhat relevant out of the TORP ’s 
relevance scale, and therefore is not a reasonable reading of the TORP.  See, e.g. , ICF 
Inc., L.L.C., B -421850 et al. , Nov.  7, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 254 at  7 (“Where a protester 
and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the 
matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.”).   
We therefore deny this ground of protest.
7 
 
The protester next alleges that the agency’s consideration of additional CPARS 
assessments for efforts beyond those submitted in PeopleTec’s proposal was improper, 
as the agency made no determination that those efforts were relevant to the instant 
requirem ent.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-30.  The record reflects, however, that 
the only conclusion the agency drew from its review of those performance assessments  
was that there was “no adverse information” with respect to PeopleTec or its proposed major subcontractors.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8.  
Thus, the agency’s consideration of the additional CPARS assessments did not have the effect of improving PeopleTec’s past performance evaluation; rather, the record 
reflects that the agency only confirmed the absence of negative performance information.   Accordingly, to whatever extent the agency erred in not determining the 
relevance of these efforts, the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prejudice arising from that alleged error.   We therefore deny this protest allegation as 
well. 
 
Finally, the protester contends that the agency’s assignment of a rating of satisfactory 
confidence to PeopleTec’s proposal was unreasonable because it was based upon the agency’s conclusion that PeopleTec’s past efforts collectively spanned the R CCTO 
SETA PWS, which the protester argues is not supported by the crosswalk contained in PeopleTec’s proposal .  Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-35.  The TORP’s instructions 
required offerors to “crosswalk to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PWS” --i.e., 
paragr aph 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and so forth.   Amended TORP at  9.  PeopleTec’s proposal 
included that crosswalk, see AR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9, 
but as the protester points out, it does not tie any past performance reference to eight out of the 58 third- level paragraphs, Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-32.
8  
 
7 Because the protester has not advanced a reasonable reading of the solicitation, we 
similarly deny its allegation that the TORP was latently ambiguous as to whether the relevance criteria were minimum requirements.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 23-24; ICF, supra at 7 (“An ambiguity exists were two or more reasonable 
interpretations of the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible.”).  
8 The protester further contends that, if the two references performed by PeopleTec 
were removed, that number would grow to 17.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  32-34.  As 
discussed above, however, we conclude that the agency reasonably considered those references in its evaluation of PeopleTec’s past performance.   Page 14    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Consequently, the protester contends, the agency’s assignment of a satisfactory 
confidence rating rests upon an erroneous foundation.  
 The contracting officer states --and the protester agrees --that the TORP “had no stated 
minimum threshold in [the] number of third level paragraphs any offeror was required to meet.”  Supp. COS at  9; Supp. Comments at  25.  While the agency’s response does not 
squarely meet the gravamen of the protester’s argument --that the agency unreasonably 
determined, based on the crosswalk in PeopleTec’s proposal, that PeopleTec’s past efforts collectively spanned the PWS’s requirement s--it highlights the distinction our  
Office has recognized between instructions and evaluation criteria.  
 We previously have concluded that information provided in a solicitation’s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria detailed in a solicitation’s evaluation section.  STAcqMe LLC , B-417128, Feb.  25, 2019, 2019  CPD ¶ 95 at  5; 
University Rsch. Co., LLC , B-294358.6, B -294358.7, Apr.  20, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 83 
at 18.  In this regard, rather than establishing minimum evaluation standards, a 
solicitation’s instructions to offerors section generally provides guidance to assist offerors in preparing and organizing their proposal s.  STAcqMe , supra at 5.  The 
information required by the instructions does not have to correspond to the evaluation criteria.  University Rsch. , supra at 18. 
 Here, while the TORP’s instructions directed offerors to crosswalk their past performance references to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PW S, its evaluation 
criteria were silent as to how the agency would assess the breadth of an offeror’s past performance.  See  Amended TORP at  18-19.  Thus, as the contracting officer points 
out, the TORP did not require that an offeror demonstrate past performance for each of the third- level paragraphs.  More saliently, though, because the TORP did not require 
such a demonstration, we conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the  
agency’s conclusion that PeopleTec’s “collective [p]ast [p]erformance record with available assessments covers the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS .”  
AR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8. 
 Paragraph 2.0 of the PWS contained eight substantive paragraphs at the second level, 
starting at paragraph 2.1 and concluding with paragraph 2.8, each covering a category 
of services such as program management services or financial management services, and each also containing several third- level paragraphs  discussing more granular tasks 
within  those services .  See Amended PWS at  10-28.  PeopleTec’s crosswalk tied past 
performance references to all of the third- level paragraphs within paragraphs  2.1 to 2.4 
and 2.7 to 2.8.  The missing third- level paragraphs fall within paragraphs  2.5 and 2.6.  
Within those paragraphs, however, PeopleTec’s crosswalk provides references for seven out of the 10 third- level paragraphs within paragraph 2.5, and 11 out of the 16 
third-level paragraphs within paragraph 2.6.  Thus, with respect to the missing 
third-level paragraphs, PeopleTec’s proposal nevertheless demonstrates past 
performance covering a majority of the tasks contained within the services to which the PWS relates t hose tasks.  
  Page 15    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In demonstrating experience with the entirety of the tasks contemplated by paragraphs 
2.1 to 2.4 and 2.7 to 2.8, as well as a clear majority of the tasks contemplated by 
paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6, PeopleTec’s crosswalk does “cover[] the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS [,]” as the agency concluded in its evaluation.   
Additionally, the breadth of successful past performance demonstrated by PeopleTec’s proposal is consistent with the agency’s conclusion that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance here.  The assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating therefore is consistent with the TO RP’s definition for that rating.  Consequently, the 
record contradicts the protester’s contention that the agency’s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating rests upon a faulty factual basis.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  
 Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Lastly, the protester challenges the agency’s best -value tradeoff, contending that it was 
based upon a flawed evaluation, failed to adequately document tradeoffs, and improperly minimized technical differences between the proposals and instead focused on cost/ price, thereby departing from the TORP’s tradeoff basis of award.  Protest 
at 16-18; Comments & Supp. Protest at  35-41; Supp. Comments at  26-29.  The agency 
responds that it reasonably performed and adequately documented its tradeoff analysis.  MOL at  41-45; Supp. MOL at  77-89. 
 As an initial matter, the protester’s argument that the best -value determination is 
unreasonable relies on the protester’s various challenges to the agency’s evaluation, which we have denied for the reasons stated above.  Accordingly, we dismiss this 
allegation because allegations that are derivative of matter s that have already been 
denied do not establish an independent basis of protest.  Management and Tech. Servs. , supra  at 9-10.  We also deny the protester’s allegation that the agency failed to 
adequat ely document its tradeoff analysis, as the record demonstrates that the agency 
examined and considered the qualitative merits of the proposals.  See  AR, Tab  63, 
TODD at  17-26 (discussing evaluation of each proposal), 30- 34 (comparing merits of 
proposals) ; see also Management and Tech. Servs. , supra  at 10 (“[A]gencies are not 
required to conduct a line- by-line comparison of each benefit and risk.”) (citing 
FAR 16.505(b)(7); ICF Inc., LLC --Costs , B-421850.5, Feb.  9, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 50 at  9; 
Ironclad Tech. Servs., LLC , B-419976.2, May  2, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  104 at  5). 
 In contending that the agency improperly minimized the differences between the proposals, the protester primarily points to the TODD’s discussion of the protester’s incumbent advantage afforded by its proposal to use the incumbent contractor as a major subcontractor and the resulting commitments from experienced personnel.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  38-41.  The protester argues that the agency cited an 
offsetting strength of PeopleTec’s proposal to minimize the protester’s advantage under the past perform ance factor, thereby inflating the importance of cost/price to the 
agency’s best -value determination and effectively converting the basis of award to 
lowest -price, technically acceptable.  Id.   On our review of the record, we do not discern 
a basis to sustain this ground of protest.   Page 16    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    
In comparing the two proposals, the agency noted the continuity benefits of the protester’s major subcontractor.  AR, Tab 63, TODD at  30-31.  This discussion aligned 
with a strength identified in the evaluation of the protester’s proposal under the task execution factor, which noted that the protester had “commitments from incumbent 
subcontractor team employees for 60 [percent]  of the total base year hours,” and 
recogniz ed the benefit that the protester’s approach “provides an experienced workforce 
with an understanding of RCCTO requirements and challenges[.]”  Id.  at 22.  The 
agency further noted, however, that PeopleTec’s proposal had a similar strength under the task execution factor, based on its “ [DELETED]  as part of its plan to maintain the 
current workforce.”  Id. at 18.  See also id. at 30-31 (discus sing the offsetting strengths).  
 The protester contends that the agency improperly considered these offsetting strengths with respect to the past performance factor, not the task execution factor, thereby minimizing the protester’s advantage under the former.  While the TODD ’s comparative 
analysis  does somewhat inartfully intermingle discussion of these strengths with its 
discussion of past performance, it also discusses “any benefits related to incumbency” within the context of “other aspects of the [t]ask [e]xecution [f]actor ,” in which 
PeopleTec’s proposal “present[ed] more strengths and the use of certain tools and approaches, the benefits of which are not replicated in [the protester’s proposal].”   Id. 
at 31.  That is consistent with the agency’s evaluation of proposals under the task 
execution factor.   See id. at 17-18, 21- 22 (documenting assignment of strengths under 
that factor).   The TODD further recognizes the superiority of the protester’s proposal 
under the qualifications and experience and past performance factors, while concluding that the overall superiority of the protester’s proposal --driven by advantages in the two 
comparatively less important non- cost/price factors --did not justify the “significant 
cost/price premium” associated with the protester’s proposal.  Id.  at 33.  Thus, the 
record does not support the protester’s contention that the agency improperly minimized the advantages of its proposal under the past performance factor.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 
Quantum Research International, Inc., a small business of Huntsville, Alabama, protests 
the issuance of a task order to PeopleTec, Inc., a small business also of Huntsville, Alabama, under task order requirement package (TORP) No.  24-005, issued by the 
Department of the Army for program management, scientific, engineering, logistics, financial, and ancillary services in support of the agency’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO).  The protester contends that the agency’s corrective action in response to a previously -filed protest was unreasonable; 
PeopleTec’s proposal contained a material misrepresentation requiring its disqualification from the competition; the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec’s DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   proposal under the past performance factor ; and the agency’s best -value tradeoff 
analysis was unreasonable, inadequately documented, and improperly used a 
lowest -priced, technically acceptable source selection method.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On May  20, 2024, the agency issued the TORP pursuant to the fair opportunity source 
selection procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5 to small 
business firms holding indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts under 
small business pool  4 of the General Services Administration’s One Acquisition Solution 
for Integrated Services program.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at  1; Agency 
Report (AR), Tab 26, Amended TORP at  1.  The TORP, which the agency amended six 
times, sought proposals to pr ovide services in support of rapid prototyping efforts and 
the delivery of residual combat capabilities that address immediate, near -term, and 
mid-term threats faced by Army operational units.  COS at  2; AR, Tab  20, Amended 
Performance Work Statement (PWS) at  3.  The agency refers to the task order to be 
issued as the RCCTO Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Support (SETA) task order.  
 The TORP contemplated issuance of  a single cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a 
3-year base period and one 2- year option on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering 
four factors:  task execution; qualifications and experience; past performance; and cost/price .  COS at  1-2; Amended TORP at  3, 16-17.  The task execution factor was 
more important than the qualifications and experience factor, which was more important than the past performance factor.  Amended TORP at  17.  The past performance factor , 
in turn,  was more important than cost/price.  Id.  The non- cost/price factors, when 
combined, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  
 Relevant to the protester’s allegations, the TORP’s instructions for  the past performance 
factor directed offerors to identify no more than five contracts performed by the offeror or a major subcontractor --defined as a subcontractor proposed to perform 10 percent or 
more of the effort --that were relevant to the competed requirement and either current or 
completed within the last five years.  Id.  at 9.  Offerors were to provide a narrative 
describing how each effort was similar to the requirement, as well as  a crosswalk 
between each effort and the PWS.  Id.  at 9-10.  The TORP further provided that the 
agency, at its discretion, could assess “recent and relevant performance data obtained from other [g]overnment data sources .  . . as they relate to the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) codes 541715,  541330, 541712 or other relevant codes.”  
Id. at 18. 
 With respect to the evaluation of past performance, the TORP stated that the agency would “evaluate the offeror’s record of recent and relevant performance history which must provide the [agency] a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.”  Id.  To meet the recency requirement, the TORP required  Page 3    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   the effort to have been performed within the past five years and stated that if 
performance had not occurred within the previous five years, the effort “will be considered to not meet the requirement as related to recency.”  Id. 
 The TORP stated that the agency would “evaluate if the submitted [p]ast [p]erformance is relevant based upon the ratings outlined” below:  
 
Rating  Description  
Very Relevant  Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same 
scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation 
requires.  
Relevant  Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and 
magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  
Somewhat 
Relevant  Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and 
magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  
Not Relevant  Present/past performance involved little or none of the scope and 
magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  
 Id. at 18, 21- 22.  The TORP further defined “relevant” as follows:  
 
Relevant is defined as federal contractual efforts that are similar to the requirements specified in the solicitation in terms of scope (performance requirements/contractual aspects), magnitude (dollar value), and complexity as indicated by performance that (i)  primarily involved the 
management of large subcontracting teams (i.e. more than 5 team 
members or subcontractors) in performing engineering services, [p]rogram management support, test and evaluation activities, financial management activities, and security support similar to that required by the PWS, (ii) represented a total potential value of at least $20M annually (applicable 
to prime offerors only), and (iii) was executed under a cost -type contract 
(applicable to prime offerors only).  
 
Id. at 18-19. 
 Finally, the TORP stated that the agency would assess the quality of the offeror’s recent and relevant performance record, “focus[ing] on whether the performance met contract requirements, the frequency of performance problems, and the effectiveness of corrective action taken by the contractor.”  Id.  at 19.  The agency “reserve[d] the right to 
use data provided by the offeror in its proposal[;] data obtained from interviews with cognizant [g]overnment personnel having knowledge of the offeror’s performance;  data 
obtained from applicable contract files; and/or data obtained from other sources such as the [Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past 
Performance Information Retrieval System, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity 
Informa tion System,] or other [g]overnmental databases.”  Id.  
  Page 4    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   The TORP provided that the agency would assign a confidence rating under the past 
performance factor in accordance with the following definitions:  
 
Rating  Description  
Substantial 
Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has a high expectation that the offeror will 
successfully perform the required effort.  
Satisfactory 
Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort.  
Neutral Confidence  No recent/relevant performance record is available or the 
offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.  The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on 
the factor of past  performance.  
Limited Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has a low expectation that the offeror will 
successfully perform the required effort.  
No Confidence  Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, 
the government has no expectation that the offeror will be 
able to successfully perform the required effort.  
 Id. at 22. 
 The agency received proposals from six offerors, including the protester and PeopleTec , by the TORP’s closing date of August  16, 2024.  COS at  2.  On 
December  4, the agency issued a task order to PeopleTec, and the protester 
subsequently filed a protest with our Office on December  17, alleging that the agency 
erred in its evaluation and that PeopleTec materially misrepresented its corporate experience.  Id. at 5-6; Quantum Rsch. Int’l, Inc., B -423237, Jan.  16, 2025 (unpublished 
decision).   Thereafter, the agency advised that it would reevaluate proposals and make 
a new award decision, as well as tak e any other appropriate action consistent with 
procurement regulations, and we therefore dismissed the protest as academic.  Quantum Rsch. , supra .  While the protester objected to dismissal on the ground that the 
agency did not specifically represent that it would investigate the alleged material misrepresentation, we concluded that the protester’s objection merely anticipated improper action by the agency, as the agency had not represented that it would not investigate or consider the alleged material misrepresentation in its reevaluation.  Id.  
 As discussed further below, during the reevaluation of  proposals, the agency requested 
additional informati on from both the protester and PeopleTec regarding past contracts 
submitted as part of their respective proposals, including the effort about which the protester had alleged PeopleTec’s proposal contained a material misrepresentation.  COS at  6-7, 9.  Upon completing the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following 
adjectival ratings to the proposals submitted by the protester and PeopleTec:

AR, Tab  63, Task Order Decision Document (TODD) at  6. 
 In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that PeopleTec’s proposal was superior under the task execution factor, which was the most important under the TORP’s terms, because it presented additional strengths that the protester’s proposal did not also offer.  Id.  at 30-31.  The agency further concluded that the protester’s 
proposal was superior under the qualifications and experience and past performance factors.  Id. at 30.  While the agency concluded that the protester’s proposal overall was 
technically superior to PeopleTec’s proposal, it  further determined that the protester’s 
proposal was not sufficiently advantageous to merit the associated price premium.  Id.  
at 33.  The agency therefore determined that PeopleTec’s proposal offered the best 
value to the agency, and consequently issued the task order to PeopleTec.  Id.  at 33-34. 
 This protest followed.
1 
 DISCUSSION 
 
The protester contends that PeopleTec’s  proposal contained a material 
misrepresentation regarding PeopleTec’s role on a past performance effort , and  that the 
agency therefore was required to disqualify PeopleTec from the competition.  Relatedly, 
the protester alleges that the agency’s corrective action in response to the previous protest was unreasonable, arguing that the agency failed to reasonably investigate that alleged misrepresentation.  The protester further alleges that the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec’s proposal under the past performance factor.  Lastly, the protester contends that the agency’s best -value tradeoff determination was 
unreasonable, inadequately documented, and not in accordance with the TORP’s

this procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under civilian agency IDIQ contracts.  41 U.S.C. §  4106(f)(1)(B).  Page 6    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   terms .  For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that there is no basis on which to 
sustain the protest.2 
 
Material Misrepresentation and Corrective Action  Two of the protester’s allegations center around a task order --referred to as Mission 
Planning, Advance Decision Support Data Analytics Tools, and Cyber Hardening – 
Secure Environment Contract (MATCH SEC) --that was performed by CybEx , LLC, a 
joint venture (JV) formed by the protester and PeopleTec.
3  In the past performance 
volume of its proposal, PeopleTec described its role on MATCH SEC in relevant part as 
follows:  
 
PeopleTec, a JV member during [task order] execution, performs as the 
[task order] lead--managing nine different projects being performed for 
[U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command], [U.S. Space Force], 82nd Airborne Division, [Federal Bureau of Investigation], [Office of the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and 
Technology ,] and other customers, each requiring different technical skill 
sets.  . . . Leading MATCH SEC with the complexities of multiple 
customers and projects, and five subcontractors has equipped PeopleTec 
with the experience and expertise to support RCCTO and its project offices as a prime contractor.

The debriefing provided to the protester after the agency’s initial source selection 
decision in December  2024 discussed the agency’s evaluation of MATCH SEC as part 
of the protester ’s--not PeopleTec’s --proposal, stating that the agency had found the 
contract to be “similar in scope and magnitude as [ Quantum ] managed a $77M task 
order as the managing partner of a Joint Venture[.]”  Protest at  7.  As Quantum ’s 
proposal had not included any discussion of MATCH SEC, the protester raised concerns about the debr iefing statement in its follow- up questions.  Id.  at 8.  The agency 
responded that it had “inadvertently mis -reference[d] a finding from another proposal 
with Quantum’s submission.”  Id.   This response then formed the factual basis of the

protester’s allegations and variations thereof, we have reviewed them all and concluded 
that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  
3 In February  2024, t he protester and PeopleTec resolved  a lawsuit arising out of a 
dispute regarding PeopleTec’s invocation of a “shootout” provision in CybEx ’s operating 
agreement allowing either member to require the other member to elect to buy or sell its ownership interest at a specified price.  Protest, app.  at A_18- A_19 (First Decl. of

on MATCH SEC because the protester, not PeopleTec, was the managing member of CybEx  and therefore responsible for managing MATCH SEC performance.  AR, Tab 45, 
Previous Protest at  9-10. 
 As discussed above, we dismissed the previously -filed protest as academic after the 
agency indicated that it would take corrective action.  As part of that corrective action--which also included the reevaluation of proposals --the agency asked PeopleTec 
to answer the following questions:  
 
1.  Was PeopleTec a participating member of the Cybex JV during the performance of the MATCH SEC Task Order?  2.  Did PeopleTec serve as a Task Order Lead for the MATCH SEC T ask 
Order?  
 3.  Did the MATCH SEC Task Order involve performance requirements which align to the RCCTO SETA Support TORP 24- 005 PWS paragraphs 
[DELETED] ? 
 4.  Did PeopleTec personnel perform on MATCH SEC [task order] requirements which map to each of these RCCTO SETA Support TORP 24-005 PWS paragraphs ( [DELETED] )? 
 5.  Did PeopleTec’s Support under the MATCH SEC Task Order include 
management of five subcontractor Vendors in performance of the Task Order?  
 
AR, Tab  51, Clarification Req . to PeopleTec.  PeopleTec  responded “Yes” to each of 
those questions.  AR, Tab 52, PeopleTec Clarification Resp.  at 1. 
 In the instant protest, the protester renews its contention that PeopleTec  
misrepresented its role on MATCH SEC.   Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 8-13; Supp. Comments at  4-10.  In particular, the protester argues that PeopleTec 
could not truthfully state that it  managed subcontractors on MATCH SEC because the 
protester, not PeopleTec, was the managing member of CybEx .  Protest at  11; 
Comments & Supp. Protest at  9-10; Supp. Comments at  6-10.  The protester further 
contends that PeopleTec’s responses to the agency’s questions also misrepresented PeopleTec’s role on MATCH SEC for similar reasons.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 12-13; Supp. Comments at  4-10.  The protester argues that these statements 
constituted material misrepresentations requiring PeopleTec’s disqualification from the competition.  Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp. Protest at  14-16; Supp. Comments 
at 10.  The agency and intervenor respond that PeopleTec’s proposal did not state that 
PeopleTec was CybEx ’s managing member or otherwi se misrepresent PeopleTec’s role 
on MATCH SEC, and, furthermore, that the agency’s consideration of PeopleTec’s performance on MATCH SEC  did not have a significant impact upon the evaluation.   Page 8    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  28-33; Supp. MOL at  24-46; Intervenor Comments

We have recognized that an offeror’s material misrepresentation can provide a basis for the disqualification of a proposal and cancellation of a contract award based upon the proposal.  A misrepresentation is material where an agency relied upon the misrep resentation and that misrepresentation likely had a significant impact upon the 
evaluation.  Avar Consulting, Inc. , B-417668.3 et al. , June 10, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 191 
at 9.  Our decisions have been clear that, where an alleged misrepresentation had no 
effect  on the evaluation, that misrepresentation was not material and does not implicate 
the validity of the award decision.  Insight Tech. Sols., Inc. , B-417388, B -417388.2, 
June 19, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 239 at  5. 
 The parties have vigorously disputed whether PeopleTec misrepresent ed its role on 
MATCH SEC.  They have skirmished as to the meaning of “manage” and “lead” as those terms are used in PeopleTec’s proposal  to describe the nature of its 
responsibilities and performance under MATCH SEC .  See Protest at  11-12; MOL 
at 20-21; Comments & Supp. Protest at  6-7, 9-11; Intervenor Comments at  4-5; Supp. 
MOL at  15, 17- 18, 34- 36; Supp. Comments at  5, 7-8; Intervenor Supp. Comments at  3.  
The protester and agency have debated the applicability and import  of the terms of 
CybEx ’s operating agreement.  See  MOL at  28-29, 32; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 2-4, 10- 11; Supp. MOL at  24-30; Supp. Comments at  3, 6-7.  And the protester and 
intervenor have collectively proffered several  declarations regarding CybEx ’s 
operations, the protester ’s and intervenor’s respective roles therein, and their  
responsibilities performed under MATCH SEC.  See  Protest, app.  at A_16- A_24 (First 
Decl. of Quantum Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )), A_610- A_615 (Second Decl. of 
Quantum CEO); Comments & Supp. Protest, exh.  1, Third Decl. of Quantum CEO; 
Intervenor Comments, exh.  1, Decl. of PeopleTec’s Chief Operating Officer.   We need 
not--and do not --wade into the morass of questions of semantics, corporate 
governance, and competing accounts that the parties have provided, however, as the record demonstrates that  the alleged misrepresentation did not have a significant 
impact  on the evaluation of PeopleTec’s past performance.  
 PeopleTec’s proposal included information regarding five efforts , two performed by 
PeopleTec and three performed respectively by its two proposed major subcontractors .  
AR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3-7.  In conducting its 
reevaluation of proposals, t he agency first concluded that each of those efforts met the 
TORP’s recency requirement.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation 
at 3-4.  After reviewing the scope, magnitude, and complexity of each effort, the agency 
assigned them the following relevancy ratings:  
  Page 9    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Effort  Performing Entity  Relevancy Rating  
Reference No. 1 PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  
MATCH SEC  PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  
Reference No. 3 Subcontractor 1  Somewhat Relevant  
Reference No. 4 Subcontractor 1  Relevant  
Reference No. 5 Subcontractor 2  Relevant  
 
Id. at 4-6. 
 In assigning relevancy ratings, the agency noted that PeopleTec’s first three references --including MATCH SEC--had annual values below $20 million,
5 involved 
services similar to  some of the PWS’s requirements, and, while the first two involved the 
management of subcontractors, they  did not involve the management of more than five 
subcontractors.  Id. at 4-5.  Consequently, the agency concluded that these references  
involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP and assigned ratings of somewhat relevant to th em.  Id.  By contrast, the agency 
noted that the remaining two references had annual values well in excess of $20 million, 
involved services similar to some or most of the PWS’s requirements, and involved the management of substantially more than five subcontractors.  Id.  at 5-6.  The agency 
therefore concluded that they involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP, assigning ratings of relevant to those references.  Id. 
 The agency then assigned an overall relevancy rating of somewhat relevant, noting that because PeopleTec’s proposed subcontractors had performed the fourth and fifth references , PeopleTec  itself did not possess any fully relevant past performance as a 
prime contractor.  Id. at 6.  Nevertheless, the agency concluded, PeopleTec’s past 
efforts collectively “span[ned] the entirety of the RCCTO PWS” and therefore merited a rating of somewhat relevant.  Id.  Because of “previous litigation invoking the MATCH 
SEC effort,” i.e., the previously -filed protest, t he contracting officer  also “considered 
whether PeopleTec adequately demonstrated sufficient past performance without considering the MATCH SEC effort .”  Id.  Excluding MATCH SEC, the contracting officer 
concluded that  PeopleTec ’s proposal nevertheless  had demonstrated sufficient past 
performance because of the collective experience shown by its other efforts.  Id. 
 In assessing the quality of PeopleTec’s performance, the agency queried CPARS to locate performance assessments  for each reference.  Id.  at 6-8.  Notably, there were 
multiple performance assessments available for each of PeopleTec’s references except for MATCH SEC, for which CPARS did not contain any assessments.  Id.   For that 
 
5 As discussed above, the agency’s debriefing to the protester containing the mistaken 
reference to MATCH SEC characterized that task order as having a value of $77 million, 
but PeopleTec’s proposal and the agency’s evaluation make clear that its annual value 
is $17.5 million.  See  AR, Tab 44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3; Tab 55, 
PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  5.  Page 10    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   effort, the only performance data available to the agency were statements from the 
contracting officer’s representative (COR)  in response to the agency’s inquiry , who 
stated that CybEx  “performed well on the effort and there were no noted performance 
issues.”  Id.  at 7.  The agency also reviewed all of the CPARS ratings for the previous 
five years for PeopleTec and its proposed major subcontractors, finding no adverse information.  Id. at 8.  Considering all of the past performance information, the agency 
determined that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance, and 
therefore assigned a rating of satisfactory confidence to PeopleTec’s proposal.  Id.  
 The agency and intervenor contend, in part, that the agency’s consideration of PeopleTec’s performance on MATCH SEC did not have a significant impact upon the evaluation, and that the alleged misrepresentation therefore was not material .  MOL 
at 32-33; Supp. MOL at  37-46; Intervenor Comments at  6-7; Intervenor Supp. 
Comments at  4-5.  On the record before us, we agree.   As an initial matter, the agency 
concluded that MATCH SEC, like all four of the other references, met the TORP’s recency requirements, and i ts relevancy rating of somewhat relevant is the same 
assigned to PeopleTec’s proposal overall under the past performance factor.  MATCH SEC also  was similar to the other two references the agency found to be somewhat 
relevant in that all three references had annual values below $20 million, involved 
services similar to some , but not most or all,  of the PWS’s requirements, and did not 
involve the management of more than five subcontractors.  
 The record also reflects that the agency considered MATCH SEC to be less relevant than the two references found to be relevant , which  had annual values over  $20 million, 
involved services similar to some or most of the PWS’s requirements, and involved the 
management of more than five subcontractors.   Furthermore, the crosswalk contained 
in PeopleTec’s proposal shows that, for each PWS paragraph to which MATCH SEC mapped, at least one other reference also mapped to that paragraph.  See  AR, Tab  44, 
PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9.  Thus, when viewed in context of all of 
PeopleTec’s past performance efforts, the record demonstrates that the agency’s consideration of MATCH SEC likely neither raised nor lowered the overall relevancy 
rating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec’s proposal.  
 Additionally, as noted above, the agency was able to review multiple CPARS assessments for each of PeopleTec’s past performance references, with the lone exception of MATCH SEC.  The overwhelming majority of the ratings for those assessments, which covered multiple performance periods, are either very good or 
exceptional.  See  AR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  6-8.  In 
contrast, the only information available to the agency regarding PeopleTec’s performance on MATCH SEC was the COR’s short , general  statement that CybEx  had 
performed well and that there were no noted performance issues.  Thus, there was substantially more performance information available to the agency regarding the non-MATCH SEC efforts, including multiple positive performance assessments 
regarding more relevant efforts.  
  Page 11    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In assigning a satisfactory confidence rating to PeopleTec’s proposal, the agency noted 
that PeopleTec “has presented somewhat relevant past performance information and there is clear demonstration of the offeror’s ability and its major subcontractor[s’] ability to perform somewhat similar work successfully through various CPARS  [assessments] .”  
Id. at 8.  In light of the evaluation finding that MATCH SEC was only somewhat relevant 
to the TORP’s requirements , the duplication in other references’ relevance t o the PWS 
requirements,  and the limited performance information regarding MATCH SEC that was 
available to the agency, that would remain a reasonable conclusion even if MATCH SEC were to be removed from the agency’s consideration, as the record of the evaluation of PeopleTec’s other past performance efforts wholly supports the agency’s 
evaluation of PeopleTec’s past performance .  Additionally, the agency’s comparison of 
the technical merits of the two proposals does not discuss MATCH SEC at all.  See  AR, 
Tab 63, TODD at  30-31. 
 On this record, we therefore conclude that the agency’s consideration of MATCH SEC 
had no significant impact  on the agency’s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating 
to PeopleTec’s proposal.   Cf. ValidaTek -CITI, LLC , B-418320.2 et al. , Apr.  22, 2020, 
2020 CPD ¶ 149 at  7-8 (denying allegation that awardee materially misrepresented its 
past performance where the rating “did not depend on the referenced contract at all”).   
Accordingly, we deny the material misrepresentation ground of protest  with respect  to 
both PeopleTec’s proposal and its responses to the agency’s questions regarding MATCH SEC.  
 For similar reasons, we deny the protester’s allegation that the agency’s questions to PeopleTec regarding MATCH SEC constituted unreasonable corrective action in 
response to the initial protest’s allegations of material misrepresentation, as the protester  cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prejudice.  Competitive 
prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest.  Computer World Servs. Corp. , 
B-421495.2, Dec.  6, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 280 at  7.  Where the protester fails to 
demonstrate that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have a substantial chance of receiving an award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Id.  at 7-8.  As discussed above, we conclude that the agency’s 
consideration of MATCH SEC had no significant impact  on the agency’s evaluation of 
PeopleTec’s  past performance.  Thus, to whatever extent the protester’s prior 
allegations of material misrepresentation warranted a more searching inquiry than that performed by the agency, the protester cannot demonstrate any reasonable probability of prejudice aris ing out of the agency’s failure to seek more information than that 
gleaned through its questions.
6  We therefore deny this ground of protest as well.  
 
6 While the protester contends that the agency should have disqualified PeopleTec from 
the competition prior to the reevaluation conducted as part of the agency’s corrective 
action, see Protest at  10; Comments & Supp. Protest at  7; Supp. Comments at  4, our 
decisions have concluded that “the mere fact that an agency identified a 
misrepresentation that it believes had a material influence on the agency’s evaluation of proposals does not obligate the agency to disqualify” the offeror.  Avar, supra at 10 n.8 
(quoting XYZ Corp. , B-413243.2, Oct.  18, 2016, 2016  CPD ¶ 296 at  6).  Page 12    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    
Past Performance  Next, the protester alleges that the agency improperly evaluated PeopleTec’s past performance, contending that the agency departed from the terms of the TORP in assigning ratings of somewhat relevant and satisfactory confidence to PeopleTec’s proposal.  Pr otest at  13-16; Comments & Supp. Protest at  16-35; Supp. Comments 
at 14-26.  The agency and intervenor respond that the agency’s evaluation was 
reasonable and consistent with the TORP’s terms.  MOL at  33-41; Supp. MOL at  46-77; 
Intervenor Comments at  9-13; Intervenor Supp. Comments at  8-15. 
 An agency’s evaluation of past performance, including its consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of an offeror’s performance history, is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria.  Management and Tech. Servs. 
Alliance Joint Venture, B -422786 et al. , Nov.  6, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 264 at  5.  A 
protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment does not establish that a n 
evaluation w as unreasonable.  Id.  
 The protester first contends that the agency improperly assigned relevancy ratings of somewhat relevant to the two references in PeopleTec’s proposal performed by PeopleTec itself.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  17-21.  The protester argues that 
because the TORP defined “relevant” in terms of criteria the agency would use to assess similarity of scope, magnitude, and complexity, it set minimum requirements  that 
had to be met in order to merit a rating other than “not relevant.”   Thus, for example, the 
protest er contends that the rating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec’s first 
past performance reference was improper because, as the agency concluded, it  
(i) involve d the management of five--i.e., not more than five--subcontractors  in 
performing similar requirements; and (ii) ha d an annual value of $7.68 million --i.e., less 
than $20 million .  Id. at 17-18.  The agency responds that, under a plain reading, the 
TORP did not establish minimum criteria for relevance, and the agency’s assignment of somewhat relevant ratings was reasonable and in accordance with the TORP, as the references had some similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to the solicited requirement.  Supp. MOL at  53-56. 
 The protester’s argument rests upon an unreasonable reading of the TORP.  While the TORP laid out criteria against which the agency would evaluate past performance references for relevance, it also provided for the assessment of relevance on a scale.   
Thus, a reference involving “some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires” would merit  a rating of somewhat relevant  under 
the TORP’s terms , while a reference involving “similar scope and magnitude of effort 
and complex ities this solicitation requires” would merit a rating of relevant.  To find, as 
the protester urges, that the TORP’s criteria for scope, magnitude, and complexity were minimum requirements , a reference meeting all of those putatively minimum 
requirements necessarily would merit a rating of relevant, as it would involve “similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities”  as those terms are defined in the  Page 13    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   TORP,  not “some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities.”  In that way, 
the protester’s argument  would read the rating of somewhat relevant out of the TORP ’s 
relevance scale, and therefore is not a reasonable reading of the TORP.  See, e.g. , ICF 
Inc., L.L.C., B -421850 et al. , Nov.  7, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 254 at  7 (“Where a protester 
and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the 
matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.”).   
We therefore deny this ground of protest.
7 
 
The protester next alleges that the agency’s consideration of additional CPARS 
assessments for efforts beyond those submitted in PeopleTec’s proposal was improper, 
as the agency made no determination that those efforts were relevant to the instant 
requirem ent.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-30.  The record reflects, however, that 
the only conclusion the agency drew from its review of those performance assessments  
was that there was “no adverse information” with respect to PeopleTec or its proposed major subcontractors.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8.  
Thus, the agency’s consideration of the additional CPARS assessments did not have the effect of improving PeopleTec’s past performance evaluation; rather, the record 
reflects that the agency only confirmed the absence of negative performance information.   Accordingly, to whatever extent the agency erred in not determining the 
relevance of these efforts, the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prejudice arising from that alleged error.   We therefore deny this protest allegation as 
well. 
 
Finally, the protester contends that the agency’s assignment of a rating of satisfactory 
confidence to PeopleTec’s proposal was unreasonable because it was based upon the agency’s conclusion that PeopleTec’s past efforts collectively spanned the R CCTO 
SETA PWS, which the protester argues is not supported by the crosswalk contained in PeopleTec’s proposal .  Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-35.  The TORP’s instructions 
required offerors to “crosswalk to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PWS” --i.e., 
paragr aph 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and so forth.   Amended TORP at  9.  PeopleTec’s proposal 
included that crosswalk, see AR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9, 
but as the protester points out, it does not tie any past performance reference to eight out of the 58 third- level paragraphs, Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-32.
8  
 
7 Because the protester has not advanced a reasonable reading of the solicitation, we 
similarly deny its allegation that the TORP was latently ambiguous as to whether the relevance criteria were minimum requirements.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 23-24; ICF, supra at 7 (“An ambiguity exists were two or more reasonable 
interpretations of the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible.”).  
8 The protester further contends that, if the two references performed by PeopleTec 
were removed, that number would grow to 17.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  32-34.  As 
discussed above, however, we conclude that the agency reasonably considered those references in its evaluation of PeopleTec’s past performance.   Page 14    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Consequently, the protester contends, the agency’s assignment of a satisfactory 
confidence rating rests upon an erroneous foundation.  
 The contracting officer states --and the protester agrees --that the TORP “had no stated 
minimum threshold in [the] number of third level paragraphs any offeror was required to meet.”  Supp. COS at  9; Supp. Comments at  25.  While the agency’s response does not 
squarely meet the gravamen of the protester’s argument --that the agency unreasonably 
determined, based on the crosswalk in PeopleTec’s proposal, that PeopleTec’s past efforts collectively spanned the PWS’s requirement s--it highlights the distinction our  
Office has recognized between instructions and evaluation criteria.  
 We previously have concluded that information provided in a solicitation’s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria detailed in a solicitation’s evaluation section.  STAcqMe LLC , B-417128, Feb.  25, 2019, 2019  CPD ¶ 95 at  5; 
University Rsch. Co., LLC , B-294358.6, B -294358.7, Apr.  20, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 83 
at 18.  In this regard, rather than establishing minimum evaluation standards, a 
solicitation’s instructions to offerors section generally provides guidance to assist offerors in preparing and organizing their proposal s.  STAcqMe , supra at 5.  The 
information required by the instructions does not have to correspond to the evaluation criteria.  University Rsch. , supra at 18. 
 Here, while the TORP’s instructions directed offerors to crosswalk their past performance references to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PW S, its evaluation 
criteria were silent as to how the agency would assess the breadth of an offeror’s past performance.  See  Amended TORP at  18-19.  Thus, as the contracting officer points 
out, the TORP did not require that an offeror demonstrate past performance for each of the third- level paragraphs.  More saliently, though, because the TORP did not require 
such a demonstration, we conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the  
agency’s conclusion that PeopleTec’s “collective [p]ast [p]erformance record with available assessments covers the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS .”  
AR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8. 
 Paragraph 2.0 of the PWS contained eight substantive paragraphs at the second level, 
starting at paragraph 2.1 and concluding with paragraph 2.8, each covering a category 
of services such as program management services or financial management services, and each also containing several third- level paragraphs  discussing more granular tasks 
within  those services .  See Amended PWS at  10-28.  PeopleTec’s crosswalk tied past 
performance references to all of the third- level paragraphs within paragraphs  2.1 to 2.4 
and 2.7 to 2.8.  The missing third- level paragraphs fall within paragraphs  2.5 and 2.6.  
Within those paragraphs, however, PeopleTec’s crosswalk provides references for seven out of the 10 third- level paragraphs within paragraph 2.5, and 11 out of the 16 
third-level paragraphs within paragraph 2.6.  Thus, with respect to the missing 
third-level paragraphs, PeopleTec’s proposal nevertheless demonstrates past 
performance covering a majority of the tasks contained within the services to which the PWS relates t hose tasks.  
  Page 15    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In demonstrating experience with the entirety of the tasks contemplated by paragraphs 
2.1 to 2.4 and 2.7 to 2.8, as well as a clear majority of the tasks contemplated by 
paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6, PeopleTec’s crosswalk does “cover[] the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS [,]” as the agency concluded in its evaluation.   
Additionally, the breadth of successful past performance demonstrated by PeopleTec’s proposal is consistent with the agency’s conclusion that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance here.  The assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating therefore is consistent with the TO RP’s definition for that rating.  Consequently, the 
record contradicts the protester’s contention that the agency’s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating rests upon a faulty factual basis.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  
 Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Lastly, the protester challenges the agency’s best -value tradeoff, contending that it was 
based upon a flawed evaluation, failed to adequately document tradeoffs, and improperly minimized technical differences between the proposals and instead focused on cost/ price, thereby departing from the TORP’s tradeoff basis of award.  Protest 
at 16-18; Comments & Supp. Protest at  35-41; Supp. Comments at  26-29.  The agency 
responds that it reasonably performed and adequately documented its tradeoff analysis.  MOL at  41-45; Supp. MOL at  77-89. 
 As an initial matter, the protester’s argument that the best -value determination is 
unreasonable relies on the protester’s various challenges to the agency’s evaluation, which we have denied for the reasons stated above.  Accordingly, we dismiss this 
allegation because allegations that are derivative of matter s that have already been 
denied do not establish an independent basis of protest.  Management and Tech. Servs. , supra  at 9-10.  We also deny the protester’s allegation that the agency failed to 
adequat ely document its tradeoff analysis, as the record demonstrates that the agency 
examined and considered the qualitative merits of the proposals.  See  AR, Tab  63, 
TODD at  17-26 (discussing evaluation of each proposal), 30- 34 (comparing merits of 
proposals) ; see also Management and Tech. Servs. , supra  at 10 (“[A]gencies are not 
required to conduct a line- by-line comparison of each benefit and risk.”) (citing 
FAR 16.505(b)(7); ICF Inc., LLC --Costs , B-421850.5, Feb.  9, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 50 at  9; 
Ironclad Tech. Servs., LLC , B-419976.2, May  2, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶  104 at  5). 
 In contending that the agency improperly minimized the differences between the proposals, the protester primarily points to the TODD’s discussion of the protester’s incumbent advantage afforded by its proposal to use the incumbent contractor as a major subcontractor and the resulting commitments from experienced personnel.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  38-41.  The protester argues that the agency cited an 
offsetting strength of PeopleTec’s proposal to minimize the protester’s advantage under the past perform ance factor, thereby inflating the importance of cost/price to the 
agency’s best -value determination and effectively converting the basis of award to 
lowest -price, technically acceptable.  Id.   On our review of the record, we do not discern 
a basis to sustain this ground of protest.   Page 16    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    
In comparing the two proposals, the agency noted the continuity benefits of the protester’s major subcontractor.  AR, Tab 63, TODD at  30-31.  This discussion aligned 
with a strength identified in the evaluation of the protester’s proposal under the task execution factor, which noted that the protester had “commitments from incumbent 
subcontractor team employees for 60 [percent]  of the total base year hours,” and 
recogniz ed the benefit that the protester’s approach “provides an experienced workforce 
with an understanding of RCCTO requirements and challenges[.]”  Id.  at 22.  The 
agency further noted, however, that PeopleTec’s proposal had a similar strength under the task execution factor, based on its “ [DELETED]  as part of its plan to maintain the 
current workforce.”  Id. at 18.  See also id. at 30-31 (discus sing the offsetting strengths).  
 The protester contends that the agency improperly considered these offsetting strengths with respect to the past performance factor, not the task execution factor, thereby minimizing the protester’s advantage under the former.  While the TODD ’s comparative 
analysis  does somewhat inartfully intermingle discussion of these strengths with its 
discussion of past performance, it also discusses “any benefits related to incumbency” within the context of “other aspects of the [t]ask [e]xecution [f]actor ,” in which 
PeopleTec’s proposal “present[ed] more strengths and the use of certain tools and approaches, the benefits of which are not replicated in [the protester’s proposal].”   Id. 
at 31.  That is consistent with the agency’s evaluation of proposals under the task 
execution factor.   See id. at 17-18, 21- 22 (documenting assignment of strengths under 
that factor).   The TODD further recognizes the superiority of the protester’s proposal 
under the qualifications and experience and past performance factors, while concluding that the overall superiority of the protester’s proposal --driven by advantages in the two 
comparatively less important non- cost/price factors --did not justify the “significant 
cost/price premium” associated with the protester’s proposal.  Id.  at 33.  Thus, the 
record does not support the protester’s contention that the agency improperly minimized the advantages of its proposal under the past performance factor.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 NexGen Data Systems, Inc., a small business of North Charleston, South Carolina, 
protests the issuance of a task order to Modus21, LLC, a small business also of North 
Charleston, South Carolina, under request for proposals (RFP) No.  N6523624R3020, 
issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic, for information technology  (IT) support services.  The protester contends that the agency 
improperly evaluated proposals and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  
resulting from that improper evaluation.  We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the RFP on September  17, 2024, pursuant to the procedures in 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5, to firms holding the Navy’s 
SeaPort -Next Generation indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at  3.  The RFP, 
which the agency amended twice, was set aside for small businesses and sought proposals for the provision of IT, network, planning, architectural analysis, evaluation, design, development, engineering, transition, cyber security, programmatic, and sustainment support services.  Id.  at 3-4; Agency Report (AR) Tab 3, RFP at  8.  A 
primary focus of the services to be provided is the transition from a mostly Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hosting methodology --which meets business process needs through 
on-premises data center hosting- -to commercial cloud hosting environments including 
IaaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.  RFP at 9. 
 The RFP contemplated issuance of a single, cost -plus-fixed -fee, level -of-effort task 
order with a 12- month base period and four , 12-month options.  Id.  at 2, 101.  The total 
level of effort across all 60 months of performance is 1,787,550 labor hours.  Id. at 4; 
COS/MOL at 3.  The agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal 
was determined to be the technically superior proposal with a fair and reasonable cost/price.  RFP at  147.  The agency would determine technical superiority on the basis 
of three factors:  technical capability ; technical understanding;  and staffing plan.  Id. 
at 147-149.  Only the technical capability and technical understanding factors are 
relevant here.  
 Under the technical capability factor, offerors were to submit information regarding at least one, and no more than five, examples of corporate experience.  Id. at 141.  The 
RFP required offerors to submit at least one reference performed by the offeror and at least one reference performed by any significant subcontractor, a term the RFP defined as a subcontractor or any subsidiary or separate legal entity affiliated with the offeror that was proposed to perform at least 20 percent (without rounding) of the total 
proposed labor hours.  Id.   The RFP stated that the agency would evaluate only 
references performed by either the offeror or a significant subcontractor, and that any other reference data would not be considered.  Id.   The RFP  further  stated that “[o]nly 
contract references that are determined to be current and relevant will be evaluated.”  Id. at 149.  The RFP defined “current” as having been performed within the last three 
years from the date of RFP issuance, and “relevant” as being “similar to the requirements of [the] RFP.”  Id. at 141. 
 The RFP provided that the agency would evaluate proposals under the technical capability factor considering three elements, referred to as elements A1, A2, and A3:  
 
Element A1:  Demonstrate experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud at Impact Level 4.  Taking into consideration AWS best practices and cloud  service manager requirements, demonstrate  Page 3    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, 
administration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with [Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)] Provisional Authorizations (PA).  Experience supporting a cloud broker in the 
development and delivery of self -service capabilities in support of hosted 
systems is considered more valuable to the Government.  
 Element A2:   Demonstrate experience providing sustainment services 
consisting of Network, Compute, Storage, Virtualization, Operating Systems, Domain Services, Remote Access, Backup, and off -site Disaster 
Recovery, for at least one on- premises enterprise datacenter.  Describe 
the manning that was required and the environment size in terms of scope of responsibility for the full stack and the virtual server count.  Experience sustaining a hybrid on -premises/commercial cloud environment is 
considered more val uable to the Government.  
 Element A3:  Demonstrate experience accomplishing business process re-engineering through modernizing either a client -server, or an n- tier, 
software -based system to take advantage of commercial cloud offerings of 
native services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.  Experience using code deployment pipelines as part of the software development lifecycle is considered more valuable to the Government.  
 
Id. at 148. 
 
With respect to the technical understanding factor, the RFP directed offerors to 
“demonstrate[] their technical understanding of the [performance work statement] 
requirements by providing a detailed description of the processes and procedures proposed to accomplish the tasks, while minimizing performance risk[.]”  Id. at 142.  In 
particular, offerors were to describe, and the agency would evaluate,  their approaches 
to two elements, referred to as elements B1 and B2:  
 
Element B1:  Ensuring compliance with Naval Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidelines and including the special needs of containerized workloads, describe your approach for implementing automation into an existing manual continuous monitoring and artifact generation process to enable the reduction in personnel required to support Common Control Provider[
1] (not hosted system level) RMF 
Authorizations to Operate (ATO), and to maintain operational Cyber Security compliance, for both on- premises data centers and commercial 
cloud brokerages.  
 
 
1 The RFP defined “Common Control Provider” as “an organization official responsible 
for the development, implementation, assessment and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by hosted information systems).”  RFP at  142.  Page 4    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Element B2:  Describe the innovative techniques you would use to 
perform cost- effectiveness optimization of Navy on- premises workloads 
moving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems already running in a commercial cloud, taking into account modernization opportuniti es, system 
availability, [and] security, with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.  
 
Id. at 149. 
 The RFP provided that the agency would assess technical understanding based upon offerors ’ “technical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their 
descriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements.”  Id.  It advised that proposals “that 
demonstrate understanding by increasing efficiencies, and/or minimiz e performance risk 
are more valuable to the agency.”  Id.  It further stated that the agency would evaluate 
the extent to which proposals “demonstrate[] understanding and clearly, completely, and accurately describe[] the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully resolve the .  . . tasks described in the elements.”  Id. 
 The agency received 14 timely proposals in response to the RFP, including from the 
protester and Modus21.  COS/MOL at  4.  Following a compliance review, the agency 
rejected two proposals prior to evaluation.  Id.   One of those rejections was the subject 
of a previous protest filed with our Office, which we dismissed as academic  after the 
agency stated that it would consider and evaluate the proposal.  See  OSC Edge , 
B-423209, Dec.  12, 2024 (unpublished decision).  
 As discussed further below, the agency assigned various strengths and weaknesses to the proposals, resulting in the following adjectival ratings for the proposals submitted by  
the protester and Modus21:  
 
 NexGen  Modus21  
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY  Outstanding  Outstanding  
TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING  Acceptabl e Good  
STAFFING PLAN  Outstanding  Outstanding  
 AR, Tab  5, Selection Evaluation Board (SEB) Report at  6; Tab 6, Source Selection 
Decision Document (SSDD) at  5. 
 In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that the protester’s proposal was “slightly technically superior” to Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor, but that Modus21’s proposal was “technically superior” to the protester’s proposal under the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  The 
agency further concluded that Modus21’s proposal was “technically superior” to the protester’s proposal under the staffing plan factor.  Id. at 16.  On the basis of that 
comparison, the agency determined Modus21’s proposal to be “slightly technically 
superior ” to NexGen’s proposal.  Id.  at 19.  The agency further concluded that  Page 5    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21’s total evaluated cost of $215,280,363 was reasonable and realistic, and 
therefore that the agency would issue the task order to Modus21 under the RFP’s 
technically superior, fair and reasonable cost/price evaluation method.  Id.  at 20.  This 
protest followed.2 
 DISCUSSION  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor, unreasonably evaluated the protester’s proposal under the technical understanding factor, and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  based upon an improper evaluation.
3  We have reviewed the protester’s 
arguments and conclude that none provides us with a basis to sustain the protest .4 
 
Where an agency conducts a competition among contractors for the issuance of a task 
or delivery order under part  16 of the FAR, our Office will review the competition to 
ensure that it was conducted in accordance with the solicitation and applicable procur ement laws and regulations.  Sudofy LLC , B-422604 et al. , Aug.  16, 2024, 
2024 CPD ¶ 195 at  5.  In reviewing protests of awards in a task order competition, we 
do not reevaluate proposals but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the 
solicitation’s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  Id.  
 
Technical Capability Factor  
 
The protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21’s references 
under the technical capability factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-19; Supp. 
Comments at  3-10.  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated Modus21’s 
proposal in accordance with the RFP’s terms.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL)  
at 5-14.  As discussed below, we discern no basis to sustain the protest with respect to 
the evaluation of Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor.  
 
 
2 As the value of the issued task order exceeds $35 million, this protest is within our 
jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ 
contracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  
10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)(1)(B ). 
3 The protester initially challenged the agency’s evaluation of Modus21’s proposal under 
the staffing plan factor, see Protest at  31-34, but withdrew that allegation, see 
Comments & Supp. Protest at  31. 
4 The protester also raises various collateral arguments.  Although we do not address 
every argument, we have reviewed them all and find no basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21’s proposal included four references under the technical capability factor, one 
performed by Modus21 and three by its subcontractor, [SUBCONTRACTOR] .5  AR, 
Tab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  3, 6.  The agency ’s evaluation contains a detailed 
discussion of the experience demonstrated by each reference, as well as a determination that each of those references was both current and relevant.  AR, Tab 5, 
SEB Report at  72-75.  In evaluating Modus21’s proposal, the agency assigned a 
significant strength under element A3, as well as three strengths, one under each element of the factor.  Id.  at 75-76; AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6-8.  The agency also assigned 
two weaknesses to Modus21’s proposal, one under each of element s A1 and A2.  AR, 
Tab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6-7. 
 On the basis of the evaluation, the agency concluded that NexGen’s proposal was “slightly technically superior” to Modus21’s under the technical capability factor.  AR, 
Tab 6, SSDD at  14.  While the protester’s proposal --like Modus21’s proposal --had 
received one significant strength and three strengths, it had not received any 
weaknesses.  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  88-89; Tab 6, SSDD at  13-14.  The agency did, 
however, assign two weaknesses to Modus21’s proposal and concluded these 
weaknesses introduced “nom inal risk,” thereby narrowing the technical advantages of 
the protester’s proposal.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14. 
 
The protester contends that the agency improperly assigned a significant strength to 
Modus21’s proposal.  The record reflects that the agency assigned a significant strength 
with respect to element A3, which asked offerors to “[d]emonstrate experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through modernizing either a 
client -server, or an n- tier, software -based system to take advantage of commercial 
cloud offerings of native services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.”  A R, Tab 5, SEB Report at  76; 
Tab 6, SSDD at  8; RFP at  148.  This significant strength was based upon two of 
Modus21’s references:  one performed by Modus21 and one by [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  
AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76.  Specifically, the agency noted that Modus21’s proposal 
“demonstrate[d] experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through the 
use of cloud native services across all of IaaS, PaaS[,] and SaaS[,]” whereas the 
 
5 The protester contends that the agency improperly considered [SUBCONTRACTOR] ’s 
references, arguing that Modus21 did not propose [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to perform at 
least 20 percent of the total proposed labor hours as the RFP required to qualify as a 
significant subcontractor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  3-4; Supp. Comments at  2-3.  
The protester’s argument , however,  relies on extrapolation from Modus21’s staffing 
plan--in which offerors were to list individuals proposed for ten positions accounting for 
only 19,200 of the first year of performance’s 357,510 labor hours , see RFP at  143, 
226-227--as well as rounding, in contravention of the RFP’s directive that whether a 
subcontractor was “significant” was to be determined without rounding.  Moreover, as reflected in Modus21’s cost/price proposal, Modus21 proposed [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to 
perform [DELETED] --over 20 percent --of the total proposed 1,787,550 labor hours.  AR, 
Tab 14, Modus21 Pricing Model at  3.  The record therefore refutes the protester’s 
contention that [SUBCONTRACTOR]  does not qualify as a significant subcontractor 
whose corporate experience was to be considered under the RFP’s terms.   Page 7    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   element asked offerors to demonstrate the use of only one of those solutions.  Id.   The 
agency concluded that the demonstration of experience across all of the available 
service areas would aid in modernization efforts, and that knowledge of PaaS and SaaS solutions was relevant to the provision of services that could greatly reduce labor overhead for maintenance.  Id.  
 The protester raises two separate challenges to the assignment of this significant 
strength.  First, the protester contends that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign it based upon the reference performed by Modus21, as that  reference reflected only 
four months of performance as a subcontractor on a contract valued at approximately $10 million.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-8.  Second, the protester argues that 
Modus21’s proposal does not reflect that the reference performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR]  demonstrated business process re- engineering through the use 
of a SaaS solution.  Id.  at 14-16. 
 With respect to the protester’s first argument, the record of the agency’s evaluation is clear that this significant strength was not based solely on the reference performed by Modus21; rather, it was based upon both references.  See  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76 
(citing both references
6).  Thus, to whatever extent the reference performed by 
Modus21 does not, on its own, support the assignment of a significant strength, the record refutes the foundational premise of the protester’s argument , i.e., that it was 
unreasonable to assign a significant strength based only upon four months of 
performance as a subcontractor on a comparatively lower -valued effort .  The protester 
does not dispute that the reference demonstrated experience across all three of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Where the element asked offerors to demonstrate experience with 
only one of those categories of solutions, it was not unreasonable for t he agency to find 
that this experience, when combined with further experience across those solutions, 
had appreciable merit or exceeded requirements to the considerable advantage of the 
government.  
 The record, as clarified by the agency, also refutes the protester’s second argument.  
The protester contends that Modus21’s proposal states that the reference performed by 
[SUBCONTRACTOR]  involved only PaaS and IaaS, not SaaS .  See  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at  15 (quoting statement in Modus21’s proposal that “TeaM21 implemented 
[DELETED]  on the [DELETED]  commercial cloud brokerage, thereby enabling 
[DELETED]  to utilize cloud -native services, PaaS, and IaaS from [DELETED] , 
[DELETED] , and [DELETED] ”).
7  Thus, the protester contends, it was unreasonable for 
 
6 The SEB report mistakenly refers to the reference performed by 
[SUBCONTRACTOR] --which is the fourth and final reference submitted by Modus21--
as “CR [(contract reference)] 5,” but the accompanying page number reference to Modus21’s proposal makes clear that the agency was considering contract reference 4.  
See AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76. 
7 The protester also alleges that, by referring to “TeaM21” in describing work performed 
in its technical capability references, Modus21’s proposal contains material 
(continued...)   Page 8    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   the agency to find that  this reference also  demonstrated  experience with all three of 
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  
 
As described in Modus21’s proposal, this reference involves [SUBCONTRACTOR] ’s 
support of [DELETED] , “an enterprise- level digital transformation” that applies “cloud 
computing, [PaaS], [IaaS], .  . . and SaaS in support of cloud- native application 
architectures.”  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  14.  The proposal further discusses 
[SUBCONTRACTOR] ’s integration of [DELETED]  and [DELETED]  into [DELETED] ’s 
code development pipeline.  Id.   As explained by the agency, [DELETED]  “is recognized 
to be a SaaS solution.”  Supp. MOL at  14.  The protester does not rebut  this 
characterization.  See generally  Supp. Comments.   Thus, it was not unreasonable for 
the agency to conclude that this reference involved IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Nor was it unreasonable for the agency to conclude that this reference, when combined with the reference performed by Modus21, demonstrated a breadth of experience meriting the 
assignment of a significant strength.  This allegation therefore provides no basis to sustain the protest.  
 The protester also challenges the agency’s conclusion that the weaknesses assigned to Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor presented nominal risk.  In that regard, the agency assigned a weakness under element A1, which sought experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, administration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with DISA PA s.  AR, Tab  5, SEB 
 
misrepresentations suggesting that Modus21 and its subcontractors performed references that were, in fact, performed by either Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  
alone.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  6-7, 10, 13- 14, 15- 16; Supp. Comments at  5-6, 7, 
8-9, 10.  The protester argues that these misrepresentations render the assignment of 
strengths improper and should have resulted in the disqualification of Modus21 from the 
competition.  Id. 
Modus21’s proposal, however, clearly identifies its technical capability references as being performed by Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  See  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 
Proposal at  3 (identifying Modus21 as the performing contractor), 6 (identifying 
[SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor).  Additionally, the agency’s 
evaluation identifies Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractors.  
See AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  72 (stating that “Modus21 and its significant 
subcontractor ( [SUBCONTRACTOR] ) submitted a total of four (4) contract references” 
and identifying Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor for each 
reference).  Thus, the proposal does not contain misrepresentations, and the record demonstrates that, to whatever extent the proposal’s references to “TeaM21” might rise to the level of misrepresentations, the agency ’s evaluation did not rel y on those alleged 
misrepresentations.  We therefore deny this allegation.  See, e.g. , Avar Consulting, Inc. , 
B-417668.3 et al. , June 10, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 191 at  9-10 (denying allegation of 
material misrepresentation regarding experience and past performance where the statements did not amount to misrepresentations and the agency did not rely upon them).   Page 9    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6; RFP at  148.  The agency concluded that Modus21’s 
second technical capability reference--performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR] --did not 
demonstrate experience performing common maintenance tasks within AWS GovCloud 
or performance tuning utilizing services with DISA PAs and assigned a weakness on that basis.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The agency further 
concluded, however, that the risks associated with this weakness were nominal, as the proposal discussed experience with monitoring services that support performance tuning services, as well as having realized benefits of performance tuning such as reducing hosting, development, and migration costs.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The 
agency also found that the proposal demonstrated experience with common AWS administration items and a knowledge of AWS services with DISA PAs, thereby reducing the risks associated with the lack of experience with maintenance.  Id.  
 The protester argues that, because the RFP sought experience with maintenance and performance tuning, it did not permit the agency to make a determination beyond its conclusion that Modus21’s proposal failed to demonstrate experience with those tasks.
8  
Comments & Supp. Protest at  9-10; Supp. Comments at  6-7.  In other words, the 
protester contends that the agency was permitted only to make a binary evaluation decision based upon whether the proposal did or did not demonstrate the requested experience.  We disagree.  
 The RFP did request a demonstration of experience with certain tasks under element A2, and the record reflects that the agency assigned a weakness for failure to demonstrate some of that experience.  The analysis regarding the risk associated with 
that weakness, however, reflects a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of that risk.  
In that regard, the agency concluded that, while Modus21’s proposal failed to 
demonstrate some of  the requested experience, it did demonstrate experience with 
other, related tasks that lessened the risk associated with lack of demonstrated experience with maintenance and performance tuning.  The protester expresses only disagreement with the agency’s judgment regarding the degree to which the risks introduced by lack of experi ence were mitigated by other experience demonstrated in 
the proposal.  Without more, the protester’s argument does not show that the agency’s 
 
8 The protester also contends that, because the agency found that Modus21’s proposal 
failed to demonstrate experience with two tasks listed under element A2, it was unreasonable for the agency to assign only one weakness, rather than two.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  9; Supp. Comments at  7.  As we consistently have stated, the 
assignment of adjectival ratings and the source selection generally should not be based 
upon a simple count of strengths and weaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals.  Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec.  18, 2019, 2020 CPD ¶ 8 
at 4 (citing National Gov’t Servs., Inc. , B-412142, Dec.  30, 2015, 2016 CPD ¶ 8 at 15; 
Epsilon Sys. Sols., Inc. , B-409720, B -409720.2, July  21, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 230 at  8).  
Here, the record reflects that the agency identified and qualitatively considered the demonstrated lack of experience with both the maintenance and performance tuning tasks.  Accordingly, whether that lack of experience was labeled a single or multiple weaknesses is immaterial.   Page 10    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   evaluation was unreasonable.  See  Sparksoft Corp. , B-420944.4, June 2, 2023, 
2023 CPD ¶ 155 at  11-12 (evaluation was reasonable where the agency concluded that 
a weakness for lack of experience was mitigated by demonstration of related 
experience).   We therefore deny this protest allegation.  
 For similar reasons, we deny the protester’s challenge to the agency’s determination that the weakness assigned to Modus21’s proposal under element A3 presented nominal risk.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest at  12-13; Supp. Comments at  8.  The 
record reflects that the agency found that the weakness --assigned for not demonstrating 
experience with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center --was mitigated 
by demonstrated experi ence supporting two private cloud data centers and managing 
the VMWare virtual enterprise, which the agency concluded “would have been on a compute environment.”  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  7.  While the agency found that the 
proposal lacked details as to the nature of the compute infrastructure supported, the experience related to the element’s compute sustainment task and thereby reduced the risk associated with the lack of demonstrated experience specifically with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center.  Id.   We therefore deny this protest 
allegation as well.  
 Technical Understanding Factor  
 Next, the protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of its proposal under the technical understanding factor, alleging that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness and failed to assign multiple strengths.  We find no basis to sustain the 
protest.  
 
Weakness Assigned to the Protester’s Proposal  
 
The agency assigned a weakness to the protester’s proposal under the technical understanding factor with respect to element B2, which sought a description of “the innovative techniques [the offeror] would use to perform cost -effectiveness optimization 
of Navy on- premises workloads moving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems 
already running in a commercial cloud, .  . . with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud 
spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.”  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report 
at 92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15; RFP at  149.  The agency found that while the protester’s 
proposal discussed actions to optimize costs of cloud- operating systems, it did not 
discuss or demonstrate an understanding of balancing cloud costs and labor required to sustain the system over time.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  
The agency expressed concern that a lack of understanding of how to cost -optimize a 
system in a way that balances cloud costs and sustainment labor posed cost risks to the agency, and therefore assigned a weakness to the proposal.  Id.  
 The protester first alleges that the agency assigned this weakness on the basis of an unstated evaluation criterion, contending that the RFP did not advise offerors that the agency would consider the extent to which proposals demonstrated an understanding of the tradeoffs between cloud and labor costs.  Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp.  Page 11    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Protest at  22-23; Supp. Comments at  13-14.  The agency responds that its evaluation in 
this regard was consistent with the RFP’s terms, which contemplated an evaluation of 
an offeror’s understanding of those tradeoffs.  COS/MOL at  32-34; Supp. MOL at  18-20. 
 We conclude that the agency did not depart from the terms of the RFP in assigning this weakness.  Under element B2, offerors were to provide a description of the innovative techniques they would use in service of the agency’s “ultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.”   RFP at 149.   Thus, the 
RFP notified offerors of the ends to which the agency sought application of offerors’ proposed means.  In that way, the RFP expressly identified the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs as a matter the agency would consider with respect to element 
B2.  The agency therefore did not use an unstated evaluation criterion in assigning this 
weakness.  
 The protester further contends that its  proposal nevertheless did discuss balancing of 
cloud spend and labor costs.  Protest at  13-17; Comments & Supp. Protest at  23-27; 
Supp. Comments at  15-17.  The agency responds that it reasonably assigned this 
weakness based upon the content of the protester’s proposal.  COS/MOL  at 38-39; 
Supp. MOL at  20-22.  We conclude that the protester has not demonstrated that the 
assignment of this weakness was unreasonable.  
 As the agency recognized in its evaluation, the protester’s proposal does discuss reducing both cloud spend and labor costs.  For example, the proposal opens its discussion of element B2 with a broad statement that the protester’s “proposed strategy provides [DELETED]  to meet [the agency’s] mission objectives of maximizing the use of 
cloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, serverless) and optimizing workloads to 
reduce cloud spend and operational labor costs[.]”  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17.  
There are additional, scattered statements that also make reference to cloud spend and labor costs, such as a statement that the protester’s proposed [DELETED]  “will 
[DELETED] , thereby maximizing the use of cloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, 
serverless) and advanced cloud optimizations, resulting in cloud spend cost savings[,]” while also “ [DELETED] , resulting in reduced labor costs to deliver these services over 
time as the capabilities evolve and mature.”  Id. at 18. 
 The concern expressed by the agency, however, is that the protester’s proposal did not tie these disparate statements  together in such a way that demonstrated an 
understanding of the agency’s goal of how those costs would be balanced to control long- term expenditures.  To that end, the SEB noted that “[m]oving to cloud- native and 
containerized is not always the cheapest long- term solution.”  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report 
at 92.  The disparate references in the protester’s proposal to reductions in cloud spend 
and l abor costs, without a clear discussion of the relationship between them, do not  
demonstrate that the agency’s concern in this regard was unreasonable.  
 By contrast, Modus21’s proposal --which received neither a strength nor a weakness 
with respect to its discussion of the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs --expressly 
recognized the agency’s concern that “[h]istorically, system cloud migrations have  Page 12    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   forced the increase of [agency] sustainment labor [,]” and discussed past successful 
implementation of solutions “to realize benefits of cloud -computing and minimize 
long- tail costs of system sustainment, historically driven by labor.”  AR, Tab 13, 
Modus21 Proposal at  18.  The proposal then discussed several techniques that 
Modus21 proposed to apply in service of cost -effectiveness optimization with respect to 
both workloads transitioning to commercial cloud environments and agency systems 
already running in a commercial cloud.  Id.  at 18-19.  Although the protester has not 
alleged any unequal treatment  in the evaluation of proposals , Modus21’s proposal 
provides a useful counterexample to demonstrate the nature of the concern that led the agency to assign a  weakness to the protester’s proposal  under element B2.  As the 
protester has not shown that the agency unreasonably assigned the weakness, we deny this ground of protest.  
 
Failure to Assign Strengths to the Protester’s Proposal  
 
The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to assign five strengths to its proposal under the technical understanding factor.  Protest at  17-24; Comments & 
Supp. Protest at  27-30; Supp. Comments at  18-21.  Specifically, the protester contends 
that the agency should have assigned strengths for the protester’s proposed [DELETED] ; [DELETED] ; [DELETED]  solution  that leverages [DELETED]  for continuous 
monitoring and optim ization; migration approach addressing both modern and legacy 
systems; a nd framework for achieving continuous authority to operate (cATO).  In 
response, the agency has provided a sworn declaration by the SEB chair detailing the reasons that the SEB did not conclude that those aspects of the protester’s proposal merited strengt hs.  See  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5-6. 
 In reviewing a protest challenging a technical evaluation as unreasonable, we recognize that the contemporaneous evaluation record may lack documentation of evaluation judgments regarding individual aspects of a proposal that did not constitute strengths, and that a protester may later challenge as having been improperly disregarded.  To that end, we have noted that an agency is not required to document “determinations of adequacy” or explain in the evaluation record why it did not assess a strength, weakness, or deficiency for a particular item.  McLaughlin Research  Corp. , B-421528 et 
al, June 16, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 146 at  4.  An agency’s judgment that the features 
identified in a proposal did not significantly exceed the requirements of the RFP, and thus did not warrant the assessment of unique strengths, is a matter within the agency’s discretion and one that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate 
that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Resource Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , B-421320, 
Mar. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 101 at  9-10. 
 With respect to the first three aspects that the protester argues were strengths of its proposal, the SEB chair points to the fact that they all are tied to the protester’s proposed [DELETED] .  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  Thus, with respect to the first 
alleged missed strength, the protester’s proposal states that “[t]he [DELETED]  solution 
will integrate into the [DELETED] ’s [DELETED]  capabilities[.]”  AR, Tab 4, NexGen 
Proposal at  17; see also Protest at  18 (quoting same).  The second alleged missed  Page 13    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   strength is the [DELETED]  itself.  See  Protest at  19-20.  And the third, regarding 
leveraging artificial intelligence /machine learning for continuous monitoring and 
optimization, relates to the protester’s proposed “ [DELETED]  [that] would progress 
through the [DELETED] [.]”  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  18; see also Protest at  20 
(quoting same).  The “ [DELETED] ,” as the SEB chair points out, is part of the proposed 
[DELETED] .  See AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17 (proposing to “incorporate 
[DELETED]  . . . into the .  . . [DELETED]  to implement [DELETED] ”). 
 
The SEB chair states that these aspects of the protester’s proposal did not merit the assignment of strengths because the proposed [DELETED]  included the use of 
[DELETED] , a tool that is not approved for use with the AWS GovCloud environment in 
which the agency must operate.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He points 
specifically to the statement within the description of the [DELETED]  that the protester 
“will integrate  [DELETED]  (e.g. [DELETED] , [DELETED] , [DELETED] , with suitable 
governance and guardrails in accordance with [Department of Defense ( DOD )] 
guidelines and industry best practices for [DELETED] .”  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal 
at 17.  The agency therefore did not consider these aspects of the protester’s proposal 
to be strengths, as they relied upon a tool that is not available for the agency’s use.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl.  at 5. 
 The protester responds that it was unreasonable for the agency to consider the proposed [DELETED]  as being reliant upon [DELETED] , arguing that its proposal 
“merely listed [DELETED]  as one of several examples of innovative [DELETED]  tools 
that could be integrated into its [DELETED]  solution over time.”  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at  28.  The protester does not dispute, however, that [DELETED]  is not an 
approved tool.  While the protester disagrees with the agency’s reading of its proposal, 
it has not shown that the agency’s concern was unreasonable.  The RFP stated that the agency would “assess the offeror’s technical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their descriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements[,]” and that it would “evaluate the extent to which the offerors’ .  . . proposal submission demonstrates 
understanding[.]”  RFP at  149.  It is not unreasonable for the agency to be concerned 
that proffering an unapproved tool for potential use does not sufficiently demonstrate an 
offeror’s understanding of technical requirements  so as to warrant the assignment of 
multiple strengths .  Cf.  Parsons Gov’t Servs. Inc. , B-422849, Nov.  21, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 287 at  13-15 (weakness reasonably assigned where protester proposed use of a tool 
that was not accredited on DOD networks).   On this record, the protester has not 
demonstrated that the agency’s decision not to assign strengths for these three aspects of the protester’s proposal was unreasonable, and we therefore deny these protest allegations.  
 Next, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its proposed migration approach addressing both modern and legacy systems, pointing in part to its proposal to “rapidly transition [scalable processor architecture (SPARC)]  systems to AWS 
Outposts.”  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Protest at  21 (discussing 
transition).  The SEB chair states that the agency did not assign a strength for this  Page 14    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   aspect because SPARC workloads cannot be transitioned to AWS Outposts due to a 
processor architecture mismatch.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He elaborates 
that “[t]he purpose of the Outposts is to rapidly transition x86 architecture based 
systems while the SPARC workloads remain on- premises until they can be properly 
refactored into x86- based systems.”  Id. at 5-6.  The protester does not dispute these 
statements , see generally  Supp. Comments , and we discern no discussion in the 
protester’s proposal recognizing the need for refactoring of SPARC workloads identified 
by the SEB chair .  Again, the protester has not demonstrated that the agency’s position 
was unreasonable, as the proposal does not adequately explain the protester’s 
technical understanding regarding the transition of SPARC systems  or why its approach 
would otherwise warrant the assignment of a strength.  We accordingly deny this protest 
allegation as well.  
 Finally, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its comprehensive framework for achieving cATO.  See  Protest at  22-23.  The SEB chair states that the 
protester’s proposed solution “does nothing for the Government’s existing infrastructure -based common control provider  packages that are the largest part of our 
current RMF ATO workload.”  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  6.  The protester 
responds that this position ignores discussion in its proposal that, under its proposed framework, “[DELETED] .”  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Comments & 
Supp. Protest at  30 (quoting same).  The agency does not substantively address the 
protester’s rebuttal, stating only that the agency did not overlook this statement in the protester’s proposal, and reiterating the SEB chair’ s statement.  See Supp. MOL at  30. 
 In the absence of a clear explanation from the agency addressing the substance of the 
proposal language to which the protester points, we are unable to draw any conclusion 
whether the protester has demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable in this regard.   Even if the agency’s failure to assign a strength for this aspect of the 
protester’s proposal was unreasonable, however, we conclude that the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable possibility of  prejudice arising from that lone putati ve error.   
Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency’s improper actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  ICI Servs. Corp. , B-418255.5, B -418255.6, Oct.  13, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 342 at  13.  Where the 
record establishes no reasonable possibility of prejudice, we will not sustain a protest even if defects in the procurement were found.  Id.  
 As discussed above, the agency’s evaluation was reasonable in all other regards.  Thus, the agency’s conclusions that the protester’s proposal was “slightly technically superior” to Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor and that Modus21’ s proposal was “technically superior” to the protester’s proposal under the 
staffing plan factor remain undisturbed.  Under the technical understanding factor, the agency assigned two strengths and one weakness to Modus21’s proposal, and no strengths and one weakness to the protester’s proposal, concluding that Modus21’s proposal --which merited strengths under both elements of the factor --“provides more  Page 15    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   benefit across more aspects” of the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD 
at 15. 
 
Even assuming that the protester’s proposal received a strength under element B1 for 
its comprehensive framework for achieving cATO , as the protester urges, the protester’s 
proposal still would not offer strengths across both elements of the technical understanding factor, as the agency found supported its finding that Modus21’s 
proposal  was technically superior  under that factor .  Furthermore, even if the technical 
gap between the two proposals were to narrow, such that the agency would have found that Modus21’s proposal was only “slightly technically superior” to the protester’s  
proposal under the technical understanding factor , at most that would leave the 
proposals with offsetting advantages under the technical capability and technical 
understanding factors, which were equally important under the RFP’s terms.   
Modus21’s proposal therefore would have remained the technically superior offer, due to its unchallenged advantage under the staffing plan factor.   As the RFP provided that 
the agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal was technically superior with a fair and reasonable cost/price, the protester cannot demonstrate that it would have had a substantial chance of award, even if its proposal had received this 
allegedly overlooked strength.  
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 NexGen Data Systems, Inc., a small business of North Charleston, South Carolina, 
protests the issuance of a task order to Modus21, LLC, a small business also of North 
Charleston, South Carolina, under request for proposals (RFP) No.  N6523624R3020, 
issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic, for information technology  (IT) support services.  The protester contends that the agency 
improperly evaluated proposals and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  
resulting from that improper evaluation.  We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the RFP on September  17, 2024, pursuant to the procedures in 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5, to firms holding the Navy’s 
SeaPort -Next Generation indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at  3.  The RFP, 
which the agency amended twice, was set aside for small businesses and sought proposals for the provision of IT, network, planning, architectural analysis, evaluation, design, development, engineering, transition, cyber security, programmatic, and sustainment support services.  Id.  at 3-4; Agency Report (AR) Tab 3, RFP at  8.  A 
primary focus of the services to be provided is the transition from a mostly Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hosting methodology --which meets business process needs through 
on-premises data center hosting- -to commercial cloud hosting environments including 
IaaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.  RFP at 9. 
 The RFP contemplated issuance of a single, cost -plus-fixed -fee, level -of-effort task 
order with a 12- month base period and four , 12-month options.  Id.  at 2, 101.  The total 
level of effort across all 60 months of performance is 1,787,550 labor hours.  Id. at 4; 
COS/MOL at 3.  The agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal 
was determined to be the technically superior proposal with a fair and reasonable cost/price.  RFP at  147.  The agency would determine technical superiority on the basis 
of three factors:  technical capability ; technical understanding;  and staffing plan.  Id. 
at 147-149.  Only the technical capability and technical understanding factors are 
relevant here.  
 Under the technical capability factor, offerors were to submit information regarding at least one, and no more than five, examples of corporate experience.  Id. at 141.  The 
RFP required offerors to submit at least one reference performed by the offeror and at least one reference performed by any significant subcontractor, a term the RFP defined as a subcontractor or any subsidiary or separate legal entity affiliated with the offeror that was proposed to perform at least 20 percent (without rounding) of the total 
proposed labor hours.  Id.   The RFP stated that the agency would evaluate only 
references performed by either the offeror or a significant subcontractor, and that any other reference data would not be considered.  Id.   The RFP  further  stated that “[o]nly 
contract references that are determined to be current and relevant will be evaluated.”  Id. at 149.  The RFP defined “current” as having been performed within the last three 
years from the date of RFP issuance, and “relevant” as being “similar to the requirements of [the] RFP.”  Id. at 141. 
 The RFP provided that the agency would evaluate proposals under the technical capability factor considering three elements, referred to as elements A1, A2, and A3:  
 
Element A1:  Demonstrate experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud at Impact Level 4.  Taking into consideration AWS best practices and cloud  service manager requirements, demonstrate  Page 3    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, 
administration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with [Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)] Provisional Authorizations (PA).  Experience supporting a cloud broker in the 
development and delivery of self -service capabilities in support of hosted 
systems is considered more valuable to the Government.  
 Element A2:   Demonstrate experience providing sustainment services 
consisting of Network, Compute, Storage, Virtualization, Operating Systems, Domain Services, Remote Access, Backup, and off -site Disaster 
Recovery, for at least one on- premises enterprise datacenter.  Describe 
the manning that was required and the environment size in terms of scope of responsibility for the full stack and the virtual server count.  Experience sustaining a hybrid on -premises/commercial cloud environment is 
considered more val uable to the Government.  
 Element A3:  Demonstrate experience accomplishing business process re-engineering through modernizing either a client -server, or an n- tier, 
software -based system to take advantage of commercial cloud offerings of 
native services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.  Experience using code deployment pipelines as part of the software development lifecycle is considered more valuable to the Government.  
 
Id. at 148. 
 
With respect to the technical understanding factor, the RFP directed offerors to 
“demonstrate[] their technical understanding of the [performance work statement] 
requirements by providing a detailed description of the processes and procedures proposed to accomplish the tasks, while minimizing performance risk[.]”  Id. at 142.  In 
particular, offerors were to describe, and the agency would evaluate,  their approaches 
to two elements, referred to as elements B1 and B2:  
 
Element B1:  Ensuring compliance with Naval Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidelines and including the special needs of containerized workloads, describe your approach for implementing automation into an existing manual continuous monitoring and artifact generation process to enable the reduction in personnel required to support Common Control Provider[
1] (not hosted system level) RMF 
Authorizations to Operate (ATO), and to maintain operational Cyber Security compliance, for both on- premises data centers and commercial 
cloud brokerages.  
 
 
1 The RFP defined “Common Control Provider” as “an organization official responsible 
for the development, implementation, assessment and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by hosted information systems).”  RFP at  142.  Page 4    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Element B2:  Describe the innovative techniques you would use to 
perform cost- effectiveness optimization of Navy on- premises workloads 
moving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems already running in a commercial cloud, taking into account modernization opportuniti es, system 
availability, [and] security, with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.  
 
Id. at 149. 
 The RFP provided that the agency would assess technical understanding based upon offerors ’ “technical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their 
descriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements.”  Id.  It advised that proposals “that 
demonstrate understanding by increasing efficiencies, and/or minimiz e performance risk 
are more valuable to the agency.”  Id.  It further stated that the agency would evaluate 
the extent to which proposals “demonstrate[] understanding and clearly, completely, and accurately describe[] the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully resolve the .  . . tasks described in the elements.”  Id. 
 The agency received 14 timely proposals in response to the RFP, including from the 
protester and Modus21.  COS/MOL at  4.  Following a compliance review, the agency 
rejected two proposals prior to evaluation.  Id.   One of those rejections was the subject 
of a previous protest filed with our Office, which we dismissed as academic  after the 
agency stated that it would consider and evaluate the proposal.  See  OSC Edge , 
B-423209, Dec.  12, 2024 (unpublished decision).  
 As discussed further below, the agency assigned various strengths and weaknesses to the proposals, resulting in the following adjectival ratings for the proposals submitted by  
the protester and Modus21:  
 
 NexGen  Modus21  
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY  Outstanding  Outstanding  
TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING  Acceptabl e Good  
STAFFING PLAN  Outstanding  Outstanding  
 AR, Tab  5, Selection Evaluation Board (SEB) Report at  6; Tab 6, Source Selection 
Decision Document (SSDD) at  5. 
 In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that the protester’s proposal was “slightly technically superior” to Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor, but that Modus21’s proposal was “technically superior” to the protester’s proposal under the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  The 
agency further concluded that Modus21’s proposal was “technically superior” to the protester’s proposal under the staffing plan factor.  Id. at 16.  On the basis of that 
comparison, the agency determined Modus21’s proposal to be “slightly technically 
superior ” to NexGen’s proposal.  Id.  at 19.  The agency further concluded that  Page 5    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21’s total evaluated cost of $215,280,363 was reasonable and realistic, and 
therefore that the agency would issue the task order to Modus21 under the RFP’s 
technically superior, fair and reasonable cost/price evaluation method.  Id.  at 20.  This 
protest followed.2 
 DISCUSSION  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor, unreasonably evaluated the protester’s proposal under the technical understanding factor, and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  based upon an improper evaluation.
3  We have reviewed the protester’s 
arguments and conclude that none provides us with a basis to sustain the protest .4 
 
Where an agency conducts a competition among contractors for the issuance of a task 
or delivery order under part  16 of the FAR, our Office will review the competition to 
ensure that it was conducted in accordance with the solicitation and applicable procur ement laws and regulations.  Sudofy LLC , B-422604 et al. , Aug.  16, 2024, 
2024 CPD ¶ 195 at  5.  In reviewing protests of awards in a task order competition, we 
do not reevaluate proposals but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the 
solicitation’s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  Id.  
 
Technical Capability Factor  
 
The protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21’s references 
under the technical capability factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-19; Supp. 
Comments at  3-10.  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated Modus21’s 
proposal in accordance with the RFP’s terms.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL)  
at 5-14.  As discussed below, we discern no basis to sustain the protest with respect to 
the evaluation of Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor.  
 
 
2 As the value of the issued task order exceeds $35 million, this protest is within our 
jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ 
contracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  
10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)(1)(B ). 
3 The protester initially challenged the agency’s evaluation of Modus21’s proposal under 
the staffing plan factor, see Protest at  31-34, but withdrew that allegation, see 
Comments & Supp. Protest at  31. 
4 The protester also raises various collateral arguments.  Although we do not address 
every argument, we have reviewed them all and find no basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21’s proposal included four references under the technical capability factor, one 
performed by Modus21 and three by its subcontractor, [SUBCONTRACTOR] .5  AR, 
Tab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  3, 6.  The agency ’s evaluation contains a detailed 
discussion of the experience demonstrated by each reference, as well as a determination that each of those references was both current and relevant.  AR, Tab 5, 
SEB Report at  72-75.  In evaluating Modus21’s proposal, the agency assigned a 
significant strength under element A3, as well as three strengths, one under each element of the factor.  Id.  at 75-76; AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6-8.  The agency also assigned 
two weaknesses to Modus21’s proposal, one under each of element s A1 and A2.  AR, 
Tab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6-7. 
 On the basis of the evaluation, the agency concluded that NexGen’s proposal was “slightly technically superior” to Modus21’s under the technical capability factor.  AR, 
Tab 6, SSDD at  14.  While the protester’s proposal --like Modus21’s proposal --had 
received one significant strength and three strengths, it had not received any 
weaknesses.  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  88-89; Tab 6, SSDD at  13-14.  The agency did, 
however, assign two weaknesses to Modus21’s proposal and concluded these 
weaknesses introduced “nom inal risk,” thereby narrowing the technical advantages of 
the protester’s proposal.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14. 
 
The protester contends that the agency improperly assigned a significant strength to 
Modus21’s proposal.  The record reflects that the agency assigned a significant strength 
with respect to element A3, which asked offerors to “[d]emonstrate experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through modernizing either a 
client -server, or an n- tier, software -based system to take advantage of commercial 
cloud offerings of native services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.”  A R, Tab 5, SEB Report at  76; 
Tab 6, SSDD at  8; RFP at  148.  This significant strength was based upon two of 
Modus21’s references:  one performed by Modus21 and one by [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  
AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76.  Specifically, the agency noted that Modus21’s proposal 
“demonstrate[d] experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through the 
use of cloud native services across all of IaaS, PaaS[,] and SaaS[,]” whereas the 
 
5 The protester contends that the agency improperly considered [SUBCONTRACTOR] ’s 
references, arguing that Modus21 did not propose [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to perform at 
least 20 percent of the total proposed labor hours as the RFP required to qualify as a 
significant subcontractor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  3-4; Supp. Comments at  2-3.  
The protester’s argument , however,  relies on extrapolation from Modus21’s staffing 
plan--in which offerors were to list individuals proposed for ten positions accounting for 
only 19,200 of the first year of performance’s 357,510 labor hours , see RFP at  143, 
226-227--as well as rounding, in contravention of the RFP’s directive that whether a 
subcontractor was “significant” was to be determined without rounding.  Moreover, as reflected in Modus21’s cost/price proposal, Modus21 proposed [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to 
perform [DELETED] --over 20 percent --of the total proposed 1,787,550 labor hours.  AR, 
Tab 14, Modus21 Pricing Model at  3.  The record therefore refutes the protester’s 
contention that [SUBCONTRACTOR]  does not qualify as a significant subcontractor 
whose corporate experience was to be considered under the RFP’s terms.   Page 7    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   element asked offerors to demonstrate the use of only one of those solutions.  Id.   The 
agency concluded that the demonstration of experience across all of the available 
service areas would aid in modernization efforts, and that knowledge of PaaS and SaaS solutions was relevant to the provision of services that could greatly reduce labor overhead for maintenance.  Id.  
 The protester raises two separate challenges to the assignment of this significant 
strength.  First, the protester contends that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign it based upon the reference performed by Modus21, as that  reference reflected only 
four months of performance as a subcontractor on a contract valued at approximately $10 million.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-8.  Second, the protester argues that 
Modus21’s proposal does not reflect that the reference performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR]  demonstrated business process re- engineering through the use 
of a SaaS solution.  Id.  at 14-16. 
 With respect to the protester’s first argument, the record of the agency’s evaluation is clear that this significant strength was not based solely on the reference performed by Modus21; rather, it was based upon both references.  See  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76 
(citing both references
6).  Thus, to whatever extent the reference performed by 
Modus21 does not, on its own, support the assignment of a significant strength, the record refutes the foundational premise of the protester’s argument , i.e., that it was 
unreasonable to assign a significant strength based only upon four months of 
performance as a subcontractor on a comparatively lower -valued effort .  The protester 
does not dispute that the reference demonstrated experience across all three of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Where the element asked offerors to demonstrate experience with 
only one of those categories of solutions, it was not unreasonable for t he agency to find 
that this experience, when combined with further experience across those solutions, 
had appreciable merit or exceeded requirements to the considerable advantage of the 
government.  
 The record, as clarified by the agency, also refutes the protester’s second argument.  
The protester contends that Modus21’s proposal states that the reference performed by 
[SUBCONTRACTOR]  involved only PaaS and IaaS, not SaaS .  See  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at  15 (quoting statement in Modus21’s proposal that “TeaM21 implemented 
[DELETED]  on the [DELETED]  commercial cloud brokerage, thereby enabling 
[DELETED]  to utilize cloud -native services, PaaS, and IaaS from [DELETED] , 
[DELETED] , and [DELETED] ”).
7  Thus, the protester contends, it was unreasonable for 
 
6 The SEB report mistakenly refers to the reference performed by 
[SUBCONTRACTOR] --which is the fourth and final reference submitted by Modus21--
as “CR [(contract reference)] 5,” but the accompanying page number reference to Modus21’s proposal makes clear that the agency was considering contract reference 4.  
See AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76. 
7 The protester also alleges that, by referring to “TeaM21” in describing work performed 
in its technical capability references, Modus21’s proposal contains material 
(continued...)   Page 8    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   the agency to find that  this reference also  demonstrated  experience with all three of 
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  
 
As described in Modus21’s proposal, this reference involves [SUBCONTRACTOR] ’s 
support of [DELETED] , “an enterprise- level digital transformation” that applies “cloud 
computing, [PaaS], [IaaS], .  . . and SaaS in support of cloud- native application 
architectures.”  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  14.  The proposal further discusses 
[SUBCONTRACTOR] ’s integration of [DELETED]  and [DELETED]  into [DELETED] ’s 
code development pipeline.  Id.   As explained by the agency, [DELETED]  “is recognized 
to be a SaaS solution.”  Supp. MOL at  14.  The protester does not rebut  this 
characterization.  See generally  Supp. Comments.   Thus, it was not unreasonable for 
the agency to conclude that this reference involved IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Nor was it unreasonable for the agency to conclude that this reference, when combined with the reference performed by Modus21, demonstrated a breadth of experience meriting the 
assignment of a significant strength.  This allegation therefore provides no basis to sustain the protest.  
 The protester also challenges the agency’s conclusion that the weaknesses assigned to Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor presented nominal risk.  In that regard, the agency assigned a weakness under element A1, which sought experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, administration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with DISA PA s.  AR, Tab  5, SEB 
 
misrepresentations suggesting that Modus21 and its subcontractors performed references that were, in fact, performed by either Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  
alone.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  6-7, 10, 13- 14, 15- 16; Supp. Comments at  5-6, 7, 
8-9, 10.  The protester argues that these misrepresentations render the assignment of 
strengths improper and should have resulted in the disqualification of Modus21 from the 
competition.  Id. 
Modus21’s proposal, however, clearly identifies its technical capability references as being performed by Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  See  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 
Proposal at  3 (identifying Modus21 as the performing contractor), 6 (identifying 
[SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor).  Additionally, the agency’s 
evaluation identifies Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractors.  
See AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  72 (stating that “Modus21 and its significant 
subcontractor ( [SUBCONTRACTOR] ) submitted a total of four (4) contract references” 
and identifying Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor for each 
reference).  Thus, the proposal does not contain misrepresentations, and the record demonstrates that, to whatever extent the proposal’s references to “TeaM21” might rise to the level of misrepresentations, the agency ’s evaluation did not rel y on those alleged 
misrepresentations.  We therefore deny this allegation.  See, e.g. , Avar Consulting, Inc. , 
B-417668.3 et al. , June 10, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 191 at  9-10 (denying allegation of 
material misrepresentation regarding experience and past performance where the statements did not amount to misrepresentations and the agency did not rely upon them).   Page 9    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6; RFP at  148.  The agency concluded that Modus21’s 
second technical capability reference--performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR] --did not 
demonstrate experience performing common maintenance tasks within AWS GovCloud 
or performance tuning utilizing services with DISA PAs and assigned a weakness on that basis.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The agency further 
concluded, however, that the risks associated with this weakness were nominal, as the proposal discussed experience with monitoring services that support performance tuning services, as well as having realized benefits of performance tuning such as reducing hosting, development, and migration costs.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The 
agency also found that the proposal demonstrated experience with common AWS administration items and a knowledge of AWS services with DISA PAs, thereby reducing the risks associated with the lack of experience with maintenance.  Id.  
 The protester argues that, because the RFP sought experience with maintenance and performance tuning, it did not permit the agency to make a determination beyond its conclusion that Modus21’s proposal failed to demonstrate experience with those tasks.
8  
Comments & Supp. Protest at  9-10; Supp. Comments at  6-7.  In other words, the 
protester contends that the agency was permitted only to make a binary evaluation decision based upon whether the proposal did or did not demonstrate the requested experience.  We disagree.  
 The RFP did request a demonstration of experience with certain tasks under element A2, and the record reflects that the agency assigned a weakness for failure to demonstrate some of that experience.  The analysis regarding the risk associated with 
that weakness, however, reflects a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of that risk.  
In that regard, the agency concluded that, while Modus21’s proposal failed to 
demonstrate some of  the requested experience, it did demonstrate experience with 
other, related tasks that lessened the risk associated with lack of demonstrated experience with maintenance and performance tuning.  The protester expresses only disagreement with the agency’s judgment regarding the degree to which the risks introduced by lack of experi ence were mitigated by other experience demonstrated in 
the proposal.  Without more, the protester’s argument does not show that the agency’s 
 
8 The protester also contends that, because the agency found that Modus21’s proposal 
failed to demonstrate experience with two tasks listed under element A2, it was unreasonable for the agency to assign only one weakness, rather than two.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  9; Supp. Comments at  7.  As we consistently have stated, the 
assignment of adjectival ratings and the source selection generally should not be based 
upon a simple count of strengths and weaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals.  Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec.  18, 2019, 2020 CPD ¶ 8 
at 4 (citing National Gov’t Servs., Inc. , B-412142, Dec.  30, 2015, 2016 CPD ¶ 8 at 15; 
Epsilon Sys. Sols., Inc. , B-409720, B -409720.2, July  21, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 230 at  8).  
Here, the record reflects that the agency identified and qualitatively considered the demonstrated lack of experience with both the maintenance and performance tuning tasks.  Accordingly, whether that lack of experience was labeled a single or multiple weaknesses is immaterial.   Page 10    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   evaluation was unreasonable.  See  Sparksoft Corp. , B-420944.4, June 2, 2023, 
2023 CPD ¶ 155 at  11-12 (evaluation was reasonable where the agency concluded that 
a weakness for lack of experience was mitigated by demonstration of related 
experience).   We therefore deny this protest allegation.  
 For similar reasons, we deny the protester’s challenge to the agency’s determination that the weakness assigned to Modus21’s proposal under element A3 presented nominal risk.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest at  12-13; Supp. Comments at  8.  The 
record reflects that the agency found that the weakness --assigned for not demonstrating 
experience with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center --was mitigated 
by demonstrated experi ence supporting two private cloud data centers and managing 
the VMWare virtual enterprise, which the agency concluded “would have been on a compute environment.”  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  7.  While the agency found that the 
proposal lacked details as to the nature of the compute infrastructure supported, the experience related to the element’s compute sustainment task and thereby reduced the risk associated with the lack of demonstrated experience specifically with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center.  Id.   We therefore deny this protest 
allegation as well.  
 Technical Understanding Factor  
 Next, the protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of its proposal under the technical understanding factor, alleging that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness and failed to assign multiple strengths.  We find no basis to sustain the 
protest.  
 
Weakness Assigned to the Protester’s Proposal  
 
The agency assigned a weakness to the protester’s proposal under the technical understanding factor with respect to element B2, which sought a description of “the innovative techniques [the offeror] would use to perform cost -effectiveness optimization 
of Navy on- premises workloads moving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems 
already running in a commercial cloud, .  . . with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud 
spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.”  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report 
at 92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15; RFP at  149.  The agency found that while the protester’s 
proposal discussed actions to optimize costs of cloud- operating systems, it did not 
discuss or demonstrate an understanding of balancing cloud costs and labor required to sustain the system over time.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  
The agency expressed concern that a lack of understanding of how to cost -optimize a 
system in a way that balances cloud costs and sustainment labor posed cost risks to the agency, and therefore assigned a weakness to the proposal.  Id.  
 The protester first alleges that the agency assigned this weakness on the basis of an unstated evaluation criterion, contending that the RFP did not advise offerors that the agency would consider the extent to which proposals demonstrated an understanding of the tradeoffs between cloud and labor costs.  Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp.  Page 11    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Protest at  22-23; Supp. Comments at  13-14.  The agency responds that its evaluation in 
this regard was consistent with the RFP’s terms, which contemplated an evaluation of 
an offeror’s understanding of those tradeoffs.  COS/MOL at  32-34; Supp. MOL at  18-20. 
 We conclude that the agency did not depart from the terms of the RFP in assigning this weakness.  Under element B2, offerors were to provide a description of the innovative techniques they would use in service of the agency’s “ultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.”   RFP at 149.   Thus, the 
RFP notified offerors of the ends to which the agency sought application of offerors’ proposed means.  In that way, the RFP expressly identified the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs as a matter the agency would consider with respect to element 
B2.  The agency therefore did not use an unstated evaluation criterion in assigning this 
weakness.  
 The protester further contends that its  proposal nevertheless did discuss balancing of 
cloud spend and labor costs.  Protest at  13-17; Comments & Supp. Protest at  23-27; 
Supp. Comments at  15-17.  The agency responds that it reasonably assigned this 
weakness based upon the content of the protester’s proposal.  COS/MOL  at 38-39; 
Supp. MOL at  20-22.  We conclude that the protester has not demonstrated that the 
assignment of this weakness was unreasonable.  
 As the agency recognized in its evaluation, the protester’s proposal does discuss reducing both cloud spend and labor costs.  For example, the proposal opens its discussion of element B2 with a broad statement that the protester’s “proposed strategy provides [DELETED]  to meet [the agency’s] mission objectives of maximizing the use of 
cloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, serverless) and optimizing workloads to 
reduce cloud spend and operational labor costs[.]”  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17.  
There are additional, scattered statements that also make reference to cloud spend and labor costs, such as a statement that the protester’s proposed [DELETED]  “will 
[DELETED] , thereby maximizing the use of cloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, 
serverless) and advanced cloud optimizations, resulting in cloud spend cost savings[,]” while also “ [DELETED] , resulting in reduced labor costs to deliver these services over 
time as the capabilities evolve and mature.”  Id. at 18. 
 The concern expressed by the agency, however, is that the protester’s proposal did not tie these disparate statements  together in such a way that demonstrated an 
understanding of the agency’s goal of how those costs would be balanced to control long- term expenditures.  To that end, the SEB noted that “[m]oving to cloud- native and 
containerized is not always the cheapest long- term solution.”  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report 
at 92.  The disparate references in the protester’s proposal to reductions in cloud spend 
and l abor costs, without a clear discussion of the relationship between them, do not  
demonstrate that the agency’s concern in this regard was unreasonable.  
 By contrast, Modus21’s proposal --which received neither a strength nor a weakness 
with respect to its discussion of the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs --expressly 
recognized the agency’s concern that “[h]istorically, system cloud migrations have  Page 12    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   forced the increase of [agency] sustainment labor [,]” and discussed past successful 
implementation of solutions “to realize benefits of cloud -computing and minimize 
long- tail costs of system sustainment, historically driven by labor.”  AR, Tab 13, 
Modus21 Proposal at  18.  The proposal then discussed several techniques that 
Modus21 proposed to apply in service of cost -effectiveness optimization with respect to 
both workloads transitioning to commercial cloud environments and agency systems 
already running in a commercial cloud.  Id.  at 18-19.  Although the protester has not 
alleged any unequal treatment  in the evaluation of proposals , Modus21’s proposal 
provides a useful counterexample to demonstrate the nature of the concern that led the agency to assign a  weakness to the protester’s proposal  under element B2.  As the 
protester has not shown that the agency unreasonably assigned the weakness, we deny this ground of protest.  
 
Failure to Assign Strengths to the Protester’s Proposal  
 
The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to assign five strengths to its proposal under the technical understanding factor.  Protest at  17-24; Comments & 
Supp. Protest at  27-30; Supp. Comments at  18-21.  Specifically, the protester contends 
that the agency should have assigned strengths for the protester’s proposed [DELETED] ; [DELETED] ; [DELETED]  solution  that leverages [DELETED]  for continuous 
monitoring and optim ization; migration approach addressing both modern and legacy 
systems; a nd framework for achieving continuous authority to operate (cATO).  In 
response, the agency has provided a sworn declaration by the SEB chair detailing the reasons that the SEB did not conclude that those aspects of the protester’s proposal merited strengt hs.  See  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5-6. 
 In reviewing a protest challenging a technical evaluation as unreasonable, we recognize that the contemporaneous evaluation record may lack documentation of evaluation judgments regarding individual aspects of a proposal that did not constitute strengths, and that a protester may later challenge as having been improperly disregarded.  To that end, we have noted that an agency is not required to document “determinations of adequacy” or explain in the evaluation record why it did not assess a strength, weakness, or deficiency for a particular item.  McLaughlin Research  Corp. , B-421528 et 
al, June 16, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 146 at  4.  An agency’s judgment that the features 
identified in a proposal did not significantly exceed the requirements of the RFP, and thus did not warrant the assessment of unique strengths, is a matter within the agency’s discretion and one that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate 
that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Resource Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , B-421320, 
Mar. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 101 at  9-10. 
 With respect to the first three aspects that the protester argues were strengths of its proposal, the SEB chair points to the fact that they all are tied to the protester’s proposed [DELETED] .  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  Thus, with respect to the first 
alleged missed strength, the protester’s proposal states that “[t]he [DELETED]  solution 
will integrate into the [DELETED] ’s [DELETED]  capabilities[.]”  AR, Tab 4, NexGen 
Proposal at  17; see also Protest at  18 (quoting same).  The second alleged missed  Page 13    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   strength is the [DELETED]  itself.  See  Protest at  19-20.  And the third, regarding 
leveraging artificial intelligence /machine learning for continuous monitoring and 
optimization, relates to the protester’s proposed “ [DELETED]  [that] would progress 
through the [DELETED] [.]”  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  18; see also Protest at  20 
(quoting same).  The “ [DELETED] ,” as the SEB chair points out, is part of the proposed 
[DELETED] .  See AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17 (proposing to “incorporate 
[DELETED]  . . . into the .  . . [DELETED]  to implement [DELETED] ”). 
 
The SEB chair states that these aspects of the protester’s proposal did not merit the assignment of strengths because the proposed [DELETED]  included the use of 
[DELETED] , a tool that is not approved for use with the AWS GovCloud environment in 
which the agency must operate.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He points 
specifically to the statement within the description of the [DELETED]  that the protester 
“will integrate  [DELETED]  (e.g. [DELETED] , [DELETED] , [DELETED] , with suitable 
governance and guardrails in accordance with [Department of Defense ( DOD )] 
guidelines and industry best practices for [DELETED] .”  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal 
at 17.  The agency therefore did not consider these aspects of the protester’s proposal 
to be strengths, as they relied upon a tool that is not available for the agency’s use.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl.  at 5. 
 The protester responds that it was unreasonable for the agency to consider the proposed [DELETED]  as being reliant upon [DELETED] , arguing that its proposal 
“merely listed [DELETED]  as one of several examples of innovative [DELETED]  tools 
that could be integrated into its [DELETED]  solution over time.”  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at  28.  The protester does not dispute, however, that [DELETED]  is not an 
approved tool.  While the protester disagrees with the agency’s reading of its proposal, 
it has not shown that the agency’s concern was unreasonable.  The RFP stated that the agency would “assess the offeror’s technical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their descriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements[,]” and that it would “evaluate the extent to which the offerors’ .  . . proposal submission demonstrates 
understanding[.]”  RFP at  149.  It is not unreasonable for the agency to be concerned 
that proffering an unapproved tool for potential use does not sufficiently demonstrate an 
offeror’s understanding of technical requirements  so as to warrant the assignment of 
multiple strengths .  Cf.  Parsons Gov’t Servs. Inc. , B-422849, Nov.  21, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 287 at  13-15 (weakness reasonably assigned where protester proposed use of a tool 
that was not accredited on DOD networks).   On this record, the protester has not 
demonstrated that the agency’s decision not to assign strengths for these three aspects of the protester’s proposal was unreasonable, and we therefore deny these protest allegations.  
 Next, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its proposed migration approach addressing both modern and legacy systems, pointing in part to its proposal to “rapidly transition [scalable processor architecture (SPARC)]  systems to AWS 
Outposts.”  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Protest at  21 (discussing 
transition).  The SEB chair states that the agency did not assign a strength for this  Page 14    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   aspect because SPARC workloads cannot be transitioned to AWS Outposts due to a 
processor architecture mismatch.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He elaborates 
that “[t]he purpose of the Outposts is to rapidly transition x86 architecture based 
systems while the SPARC workloads remain on- premises until they can be properly 
refactored into x86- based systems.”  Id. at 5-6.  The protester does not dispute these 
statements , see generally  Supp. Comments , and we discern no discussion in the 
protester’s proposal recognizing the need for refactoring of SPARC workloads identified 
by the SEB chair .  Again, the protester has not demonstrated that the agency’s position 
was unreasonable, as the proposal does not adequately explain the protester’s 
technical understanding regarding the transition of SPARC systems  or why its approach 
would otherwise warrant the assignment of a strength.  We accordingly deny this protest 
allegation as well.  
 Finally, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its comprehensive framework for achieving cATO.  See  Protest at  22-23.  The SEB chair states that the 
protester’s proposed solution “does nothing for the Government’s existing infrastructure -based common control provider  packages that are the largest part of our 
current RMF ATO workload.”  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  6.  The protester 
responds that this position ignores discussion in its proposal that, under its proposed framework, “[DELETED] .”  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Comments & 
Supp. Protest at  30 (quoting same).  The agency does not substantively address the 
protester’s rebuttal, stating only that the agency did not overlook this statement in the protester’s proposal, and reiterating the SEB chair’ s statement.  See Supp. MOL at  30. 
 In the absence of a clear explanation from the agency addressing the substance of the 
proposal language to which the protester points, we are unable to draw any conclusion 
whether the protester has demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable in this regard.   Even if the agency’s failure to assign a strength for this aspect of the 
protester’s proposal was unreasonable, however, we conclude that the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable possibility of  prejudice arising from that lone putati ve error.   
Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency’s improper actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  ICI Servs. Corp. , B-418255.5, B -418255.6, Oct.  13, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 342 at  13.  Where the 
record establishes no reasonable possibility of prejudice, we will not sustain a protest even if defects in the procurement were found.  Id.  
 As discussed above, the agency’s evaluation was reasonable in all other regards.  Thus, the agency’s conclusions that the protester’s proposal was “slightly technically superior” to Modus21’s proposal under the technical capability factor and that Modus21’ s proposal was “technically superior” to the protester’s proposal under the 
staffing plan factor remain undisturbed.  Under the technical understanding factor, the agency assigned two strengths and one weakness to Modus21’s proposal, and no strengths and one weakness to the protester’s proposal, concluding that Modus21’s proposal --which merited strengths under both elements of the factor --“provides more  Page 15    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   benefit across more aspects” of the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD 
at 15. 
 
Even assuming that the protester’s proposal received a strength under element B1 for 
its comprehensive framework for achieving cATO , as the protester urges, the protester’s 
proposal still would not offer strengths across both elements of the technical understanding factor, as the agency found supported its finding that Modus21’s 
proposal  was technically superior  under that factor .  Furthermore, even if the technical 
gap between the two proposals were to narrow, such that the agency would have found that Modus21’s proposal was only “slightly technically superior” to the protester’s  
proposal under the technical understanding factor , at most that would leave the 
proposals with offsetting advantages under the technical capability and technical 
understanding factors, which were equally important under the RFP’s terms.   
Modus21’s proposal therefore would have remained the technically superior offer, due to its unchallenged advantage under the staffing plan factor.   As the RFP provided that 
the agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal was technically superior with a fair and reasonable cost/price, the protester cannot demonstrate that it would have had a substantial chance of award, even if its proposal had received this 
allegedly overlooked strength.  
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 Revolve Solutions, LLC, of Alexandria, Virginia, protests the award of a contract to Vistra Communications, LLC, of Lutz, Florida, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W9124J -25-R-0010, issued by the Department of the Army for commercial 
communication planning and support services.  Revolve argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  
 We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
On November 27, 2024, the Army issued the RFP to procure communication planning and support services for its Office of the Chief of Public Affairs.  Agency Report (AR) Tab 3a, RFP at 1, 60.

id. at 81- 95.  The RFP contemplated the issuance of a fixed- price contract to be 
performed over a 12- month base period and four 12- month option periods.  Id.  at 61.   
 The acquisition was conducted using the policies set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 in conjunction with the procedures under FAR part 15.  AR, Tab 3o, RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  Award would be made on a lowest -priced, technically 
acceptable (LPTA) basis considering technical capability, past performance, and cost/price factors.  Id.  The technical capability factor included two subfactors:  technical 
approach, and staffing plan/key personnel qualifications experience.  Id.   The technical 
capability and past performance factors would be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.  at 11-12. 
 Prior to the January 23, 2025, close of the solicitation period, 18 offerors, including Revolve and Vistra, submitted proposals.  AR, Tab 5e, Source Selection Decision at 1; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 5.  The Army evaluated Revolve’s proposal  as 
unacceptable under the technical capability factor and the technical approach subfactor.  AR, Tab 5b, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at  33.  The evaluators 
determined that the firm did not demonstrate the ability to perform all the tas ks outlined 
in the PWS.  Id.; AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated Pre- negotiation Objective Memorandum/ 
Price Negotiation Memorandum (POM/PNM) at 18.  Specifically, the Army concluded:  
 
[Revolve’s] proposal provided unacceptable evidence in their ability to perform and satisfy all contractual requirements of this solicitation.  The proposal does not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the tasks 
outlined in the PWS.  Offeror provi des minimal evidence of their ability to 
understand the development and execution of strategies, specifically for operations research, analysis and analytical expertise required for analytical communication and assessment [in accordance with (IAW)] PWS 5.3 .  They failed to address morning news reporting required daily 
and on the weekends, breaking news requirements and how they’d support monthly media analysis across multiple social media platforms.  Offeror’s proposal stated they would produce 40 communication plans per year, but the PWS requires up to 60 per year.  Offeror failed to address the Think Tank support requirement to execute 20 events on an annual basis as required in the PWS section 5.6.  
Id.  
 Ultimately, the agency evaluated three proposals as technically acceptable, including that of Vistra.  AR, Tab  5d, Consolidated POM/PNM at 31.  The agency awarded the 
contract to Vistra because its evaluated price of $12,818,454 was the lowest of the three.  Id.  This protest followed.  
  Page 3 B-423450  DISCUSSION 
 Revolve contends that the Army unreasonably evaluated its technical approach as unacceptable.  The firm argues its proposal demonstrated its capability to perform all the PWS functions.  Comments at 1- 9.  In so arguing, Revolve asserts that the Army 
unreas onably ignored or overlooked information contained in the firm’s proposal.  See 
id.  The Army responds that Revolve’s proposal simply lacked critical details explaining 
its specific approach to performing PWS §§ 5.3, 5.4, and 5.6.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 10-28. 
 We have reviewed the allegations and do not find that any provides us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We discuss the evaluation with respect to the various PWS sections separately, but note, at the outset that, in reviewing protests challenging an agency’s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s eval uation 
criteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.  AT&T Corp. , B-414886 et al. ,

PWS Section 5.3, Communication Research, Analysis and Evaluation 
 Section 5.3 of the PWS requires the contractor to advise and assist the agency with primary and secondary research to inform communication approaches and planning across the agency’s media and community outreach activities.  RFP, amend. 4 at 35.  As releva nt here, section 5.3.8 requires the contractor to provide a daily digest of news 
media reporting that is cross -referenced with a Department of Defense daily news 
briefing.  Id.  at 37.  Over the weekend, the contractor is required to provide two digests 
per day summarizing news media reporting.  Id.  
 Section 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor breaking news from all major news organizations websites and social media platforms daily, including the weekend.  RFP, amend. 4 at  37.  The contractor must maintain a “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) list of 
breaking news stories topics for agency leadership.  Id.   Also, the contractor must alert 
agency leadership when breaking news occurs, or when there is a development in any BOLO topic.  Id.   
 Section 5.3.10 requires the contractor to provide a monthly analysis of traditional media and social media in a single report.  RFP, amend. 4 at 37.  The monthly report will analyze the agency’s messaging, and how the Army’s news stories travel through soc ial 
media.  Id.    
 As relevant here, the RFP instructed offerors to submit technical volumes as part of their proposals.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The technical volume should be clear, concise, and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation.  Id.   Offerors were specifically 
instructed that “[t]he proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government’s requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror  Page 4 B-423450  intends to meet these requirements.”  Id.   When evaluating technical proposals, the 
RFP advised that the agency would consider the clarity and reasonableness of the 
technical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the performance work statement (PWS).  Id. at 10.  
 Revolve’s proposal contains a section explaining the firm’s approach to communication research, analysis and evaluation.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized 
at 11-16.
2  The proposal discusses the firm’s understanding of the agency’s 
requirement, as well as its knowledge and experience in this area.  Id.  at 11- 12.  The 
proposal also discusses the firm’s capabilities, personnel, and approach to communications research and analysis.  Id.  at 12- 16. 
 As stated above, the agency found the protester’s proposal technically unacceptable.  The agency concluded that Revolve’s proposal failed to address several functions, including the contractor’s responsibility to produce daily digests, monitor breaking new s, 
and provide monthly reports.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM/PNM at  18.  The agency 
concluded that the firm’s proposal lacked “convincing rationale and concrete details” and generally restated the requirement without demonstrating the methodology.  COS at 9-10. 
 Revolve argues that the firm’s proposal contained adequate details demonstrating its compliance with the PWS requirements.  See  Comments at 2- 6.  For example, the firm 
argues that it demonstrated capability to produce the daily digests because its proposal showed that it has staff experienced with strenuous on- call work conditions and shows 
that the firm sets an expectation that employees will be available on the weekend.  Id.  
at 3.  Similarly, the firm argues that its proposal outlined tools and a research  monitoring 
process demonstrating compliance with the requirements for monitoring breaking news and producing monthly reports.  Id. at 5-6.  The Army counters that Revolve’s proposal 
did not contain sufficient details demonstrating the firm could fully accomplish the requisite functions.  MOL at 13- 23. 
 On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation.  As explained above, the RFP instructed offerors to explain how they would satisfy all PWS 
requirements and advised that proposals would be evaluated based on the reasonableness of the approach and ability to satisfy the complexity and magnitude of the requirement.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6, 10.  Despite that advisement, our reading of Revolve’s proposal shows that the firm did not explain with sufficient detail how it would satisfy the tasks set forth under PWS section 5.3.8; indeed, our review shows that the 
proposal included only vague, tangential references indicating that the firm could and would provide daily digests but lacks any explanation describing how the firm would perform that fun ction.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 7 
(“management staff is experienced with the need to be on- call 24/7/365, having 
developed a reputation with our customers for providing short turnaround, quality 
 
2 As part of their proposals, offerors submitted “sanitized” technical proposals which 
omitted the company’s name, logo, and other markings.  RFP, amend. 4 at 3- 4.      Page 5 B-423450  deliverables”), 15 (explaining that as part of the firm’s media monitoring process, the 
firm will develop a standard operating procedure ensuring “that checkpoints are included for daily and weekend monitoring and the BOLO list”).  While Revolve points to proposal excerpts showing that the firm sets an expectation amongst its employees for weekend work and that the firm would revise the standard operating procedure to ensure that the digests are produced, such statements are consistent with the agency’s evaluation judgment that the firm merely demonstrated a commitment to perform the duties.  See Comments at 3.  Further, while the proposal describes a general process 
for media monitoring, we agree with the agency that the proposal does not explain how the protester would accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement to produce the required digests.  See  COS at 9.  
 Likewise, our review of the firm’s proposal shows it lacked details articulating its approach to performing PWS section 5.3.9.  While Revolve argues that its proposal referenced a particular tool (“Brandwatch”) that allows its employees to monitor news media, the proposal does not articulate how the firm would use this tool or the other tools (“CisionOne” and “TVEyes”) available to perform the specific duties under this section.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 12.  Indeed, whereas 
section 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor news, develop the BOLO, and provide 
alerts to agency leadership, Revolve’s proposal only explains that the firm has the general capability to monitor news media and will proactively engage senior agency personnel.  Id.  In other words, we agree with the agency that the proposal requires the 
reader to infer the connection between Revolve’s general process and capabilities and the specific duties to be performed.  See  COS at 9.  Thus, because the RFP required 
offerors to demonstrate specifically how their proposals would accomplish the 
complexity and magnitude of the requirement, we have no basis to object to the evaluation.  
 As to PWS section 5.3.10, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the firm’s proposal lacked details demonstrating specifically how the firm would produce the monthly report analyzing traditional and social media.  While Revolve points out that i ts 
proposal committed to providing monthly reports and discussed its media monitoring and social media process, see Comments at 4- 5 (citing AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. 
Proposal --Sanitized at 14- 15), our review shows the proposal identified only a general 
method for monitoring news and social media and lacked details explaining how the firm 
would produce the report.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  15 
(“Specific to media analysis [PWS 5.3.6, 5.3.10, 5.3.15], [Revolve’s] process leverages a com prehensive suite of media monitoring tools, enabling the Army to track local, 
national, and industry coverage across television, radio, social media, print, and podcasts.”).  Again, consistent with the agency’s evaluation, the firm’s proposal simply explai ns its general capabilities but lacks any substantive discussion of how those 
capabilities would be specifically employed to meet the agency’s particular needs.  See  
COS at 10; see also MOL at 22- 23.  Thus, we find that the agency reasonably 
evaluated the firm’s proposal as lacking details showing how the firm would fulfill the duties outlined in PWS section 5.3.  Accordingly, we deny the protest allegation.  
  Page 6 B-423450  PWS Section 5.4, Communication Planning  
 
Section 5.4 of the PWS describes the communication planning responsibilities the contractor must perform.  RFP, amend. 4 at 39.  Generally, this section requires the contractor to develop communication plans to include analyzing the information environment , determining current and upcoming phases of communication initiatives, 
and developing the metrics and performance objectives.  Id.  To develop the plans, the 
contractor will need to research potential outreach events, analyze the implementation and execut ion of such events, and determine the likelihood of success.  Id.  Further, and 
as relevant here, the contractor shall be prepared to develop a minimum of 40 plans per year and a maximum of 60 plans per year.  Id. at 40. 
 As noted above, when demonstrating their technical approach, offerors were instructed not to simply rephrase or restate the Government’s requirements but rather to provide convincing rationale showing how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.  See  
RFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The RFP advised that the agency would evaluate the clarity and reasonableness of the technical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the PWS.  Id. at 10.  
 In addressing the requirements set forth under PWS section 5.4, Revolve’s proposal discusses the firm’s understanding of the requirement and experience with communication plans.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  16-17.  The 
firm also discus ses its capabilities and explains that the firm has standard plans that can 
assist the agency in “developing its more than 40 communications plans each year.”  Id.  
at 17.   
 
As explained above, the agency evaluated Revolve’s proposal as not demonstrating 
capability to support up to 60 plans per year.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM/PNM at 18.  The agency explains that the proposal did not demonstrate its ability to handle 
the “f ull magnitude” of the government’s requirement.  COS at 11.  
 Revolve argues that the firm’s proposal demonstrated willingness and ability to produce more than 40 plans per year, and therefore, the firm demonstrated compliance with the requirement to produce up to 60 plans per year.  See  Comments at 6 -7.  The Army 
responds that the proposal did not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the requirement, and failed to provide sufficient detail regarding how it would accomplish between 40- 60 communication plans per year.  MOL at 24.  
 On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation because the RFP required offerors to articulate precisely how they would fulfill the duties outlined the PWS and our review shows that Revolve did not explain how it would develop 60 communication plans per year.  While Revolve’s proposal demonstrated an 
understanding that the selected contractor may be required to produce more than 40 plans per year, the proposal did not specifically explain that the firm would be willing and able to produce 60 plans per year.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --
Sanitized at 17.  More importantly, our review confirms the agency’s conclusion that  Page 7 B-423450  Revolve did not articulate how its capabilities would allow the firm to develop 60 plans 
per year.  Id.  Indeed, our reading of the firm’s proposal shows that the firm articulated 
its general capabilities ( e.g., having long- form and short -form planning templates), 
familiarity with the Army’s structure, and communication strategists as beneficial features, but omitted any discussion explaining how these features would fare when required to produce a significantly  higher number of plans.  See id.  at 17- 18.  G iven the 
lack of clarity and supporting information, we do not find that the agency unreasonably evaluated Revolve’s proposal.  Cf. SOC LLC, B -420806, Aug. 30, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 229 at 5 (“an offeror is required to submit a well -written proposal, and if it fails to do 
so, it runs the risk that its proposal will be evaluated poorly”).  Accordingly, we deny the protest allegation.  
 
PWS Section 5.6, Army Outreach Support  
 Section 5.6 requires the contractor to provide planning and assessment support for Army outreach events.  RFP, amend. 4 at 42.  The outreach events inform and educate American communities regarding the Army’s readiness, roles, missions, capabilities, and c hallenges in areas where there is minimal Army connection.  Id.   The Army 
anticipates conducting 20 outreach events per year focused on observances and holidays, such as Asian American Pacific Islander month, Juneteenth, and the Army/Navy football game.  Id. at 42- 43.  To develop, plan, and execute these events, 
the contractor needs to conduct research considering population density patterns, media markets, top employers, universities, think tanks, and centers of influence.  Id.  
at 43. 
 
As explained earlier, the RFP advised that proposals would be evaluated based on whether they demonstrate the ability to satisfy the complexity and magnitude of all PWS functions.  RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  
 When evaluating Revolve’s proposal, the Army determined that the firm failed to address how it would execute 20 events per year. AR, Tab 5b, SSEB Report at 33.  The agency explains that Revolve’s proposal only demonstrates experience supporting outreach ev ents but does not explain how the firm would support these functions.  COS 
at 12.  Further, the agency explains that “simply citing past experiences with a different 
client and scope of work, which Revolve did in its proposal, does not demonstrate how it intends to approach the specific requirements of this contract.”  Id.  at 13.  
 Revolve argues that the Army unreasonably evaluated its proposal because it demonstrated experience supporting more than 20 outreach events per year.  Comments at 8- 9.  The Army responds that Revolve’s proposal failed to provide details 
necessary to demons trate its understanding of and ability to execute 20 events per 
year.  MOL at 25.  
 Here, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation because Revolve’s proposal lacks details showing that the firm could support more than 20 outreach events per year.  Our review shows that Revolve’s proposal generally discusses its  Page 8 B-423450  understanding of the need to conduct outreach events and the firm’s standard practices.  
AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 21.  The firm then identifies past 
experiences, capabilities, supporting personnel, and strategic approach.  Id.  at 22-24.  
Consistent with the agency’s position, we do not find that the firm specifically discussed how it would tailor or modify its general standard practices to support the Army’s specific need to host 20 events per year, such as the Army -Navy football gam e; instead, 
consistent with the agency’s position, we think any reader would be required to infer how the firm would adapt its strategic approach and standard practices to supporting the Army’s requirement.  See id.   Thus, we deny the allegation because we agree with 
the agency that the firm did not articulate how it would apply its approach to the instant requirement as was required by the solicitation.

3 Revolve also argues that the Army unreasonably failed to evaluate the firm’s price 
proposal.  Comments at 9- 10.  We dismiss this allegation because the solicitation 
specified that award would be made on a LPTA basis and as demonstrated above the agency reasonably evaluated the firm’s technical approach as unacceptable.  RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  Thus, the firm’s proposal could not have been selected for award, and any alleged failure to evaluate the firm’s price was not prejudicial.

PWS Section 5.3, Communication Research, Analysis and Evaluation 
 Section 5.3 of the PWS requires the contractor to advise and assist the agency with primary and secondary research to inform communication approaches and planning across the agency’s media and community outreach activities.  RFP, amend. 4 at 35.  As releva nt here, section 5.3.8 requires the contractor to provide a daily digest of news

 As relevant here, the RFP instructed offerors to submit technical volumes as part of their proposals.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The technical volume should be clear, concise, and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation.  Id.   Offerors were specifically 
instructed that “[t]he proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government’s requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror  Page 4 B-423450  intends to meet these requirements.”  Id.   When evaluating technical proposals, the 
RFP advised that the agency would consider the clarity and reasonableness of the 
technical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the performance work statement (PWS).  Id. at 10.  
 Revolve’s proposal contains a section explaining the firm’s approach to communication research, analysis and evaluation.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized 
at 11-16.
2  The proposal discusses the firm’s understanding of the agency’s 
requirement, as well as its knowledge and experience in this area.  Id.  at 11- 12.  The 
proposal also discusses the firm’s capabilities, personnel, and approach to communications research and analysis.  Id.  at 12- 16. 
 As stated above, the agency found the protester’s proposal technically unacceptable.  The agency concluded that Revolve’s proposal failed to address several functions, including the contractor’s responsibility to produce daily digests, monitor breaking new s, 
and provide monthly reports.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM/PNM at  18.  The agency 
concluded that the firm’s proposal lacked “convincing rationale and concrete details” and generally restated the requirement without demonstrating the methodology.  COS at 9-10. 
 Revolve argues that the firm’s proposal contained adequate details demonstrating its compliance with the PWS requirements.  See  Comments at 2- 6.  For example, the firm 
argues that it demonstrated capability to produce the daily digests because its proposal showed that it has staff experienced with strenuous on- call work conditions and shows 
that the firm sets an expectation that employees will be available on the weekend.  Id.  
at 3.  Similarly, the firm argues that its proposal outlined tools and a research  monitoring 
process demonstrating compliance with the requirements for monitoring breaking news and producing monthly reports.  Id. at 5-6.  The Army counters that Revolve’s proposal 
did not contain sufficient details demonstrating the firm could fully accomplish the requisite functions.  MOL at 13- 23. 
 On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation.  As explained above, the RFP instructed offerors to explain how they would satisfy all PWS 
requirements and advised that proposals would be evaluated based on the reasonableness of the approach and ability to satisfy the complexity and magnitude of the requirement.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6, 10.  Despite that advisement, our reading of Revolve’s proposal shows that the firm did not explain with sufficient detail how it would satisfy the tasks set forth under PWS section 5.3.8; indeed, our review shows that the 
proposal included only vague, tangential references indicating that the firm could and would provide daily digests but lacks any explanation describing how the firm would perform that fun ction.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 7 
(“management staff is experienced with the need to be on- call 24/7/365, having 
developed a reputation with our customers for providing short turnaround, quality 
 
2 As part of their proposals, offerors submitted “sanitized” technical proposals which 
omitted the company’s name, logo, and other markings.  RFP, amend. 4 at 3- 4.      Page 5 B-423450  deliverables”), 15 (explaining that as part of the firm’s media monitoring process, the 
firm will develop a standard operating procedure ensuring “that checkpoints are included for daily and weekend monitoring and the BOLO list”).  While Revolve points to proposal excerpts showing that the firm sets an expectation amongst its employees for weekend work and that the firm would revise the standard operating procedure to ensure that the digests are produced, such statements are consistent with the agency’s evaluation judgment that the firm merely demonstrated a commitment to perform the duties.  See Comments at 3.  Further, while the proposal describes a general process 
for media monitoring, we agree with the agency that the proposal does not explain how the protester would accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement to produce the required digests.  See  COS at 9.  
 Likewise, our review of the firm’s proposal shows it lacked details articulating its approach to performing PWS section 5.3.9.  While Revolve argues that its proposal referenced a particular tool (“Brandwatch”) that allows its employees to monitor news media, the proposal does not articulate how the firm would use this tool or the other tools (“CisionOne” and “TVEyes”) available to perform the specific duties under this section.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 12.  Indeed, whereas 
section 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor news, develop the BOLO, and provide 
alerts to agency leadership, Revolve’s proposal only explains that the firm has the general capability to monitor news media and will proactively engage senior agency personnel.  Id.  In other words, we agree with the agency that the proposal requires the 
reader to infer the connection between Revolve’s general process and capabilities and the specific duties to be performed.  See  COS at 9.  Thus, because the RFP required 
offerors to demonstrate specifically how their proposals would accomplish the 
complexity and magnitude of the requirement, we have no basis to object to the evaluation.  
 As to PWS section 5.3.10, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the firm’s proposal lacked details demonstrating specifically how the firm would produce the monthly report analyzing traditional and social media.  While Revolve points out that i ts 
proposal committed to providing monthly reports and discussed its media monitoring and social media process, see Comments at 4- 5 (citing AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. 
Proposal --Sanitized at 14- 15), our review shows the proposal identified only a general 
method for monitoring news and social media and lacked details explaining how the firm 
would produce the report.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  15 
(“Specific to media analysis [PWS 5.3.6, 5.3.10, 5.3.15], [Revolve’s] process leverages a com prehensive suite of media monitoring tools, enabling the Army to track local, 
national, and industry coverage across television, radio, social media, print, and podcasts.”).  Again, consistent with the agency’s evaluation, the firm’s proposal simply explai ns its general capabilities but lacks any substantive discussion of how those 
capabilities would be specifically employed to meet the agency’s particular needs.  See  
COS at 10; see also MOL at 22- 23.  Thus, we find that the agency reasonably 
evaluated the firm’s proposal as lacking details showing how the firm would fulfill the duties outlined in PWS section 5.3.  Accordingly, we deny the protest allegation.  
  Page 6 B-423450  PWS Section 5.4, Communication Planning  
 
Section 5.4 of the PWS describes the communication planning responsibilities the contractor must perform.  RFP, amend. 4 at 39.  Generally, this section requires the contractor to develop communication plans to include analyzing the information environment , determining current and upcoming phases of communication initiatives, 
and developing the metrics and performance objectives.  Id.  To develop the plans, the 
contractor will need to research potential outreach events, analyze the implementation and execut ion of such events, and determine the likelihood of success.  Id.  Further, and 
as relevant here, the contractor shall be prepared to develop a minimum of 40 plans per year and a maximum of 60 plans per year.  Id. at 40. 
 As noted above, when demonstrating their technical approach, offerors were instructed not to simply rephrase or restate the Government’s requirements but rather to provide convincing rationale showing how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.  See  
RFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The RFP advised that the agency would evaluate the clarity and reasonableness of the technical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the PWS.  Id. at 10.  
 In addressing the requirements set forth under PWS section 5.4, Revolve’s proposal discusses the firm’s understanding of the requirement and experience with communication plans.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  16-17.  The 
firm also discus ses its capabilities and explains that the firm has standard plans that can 
assist the agency in “developing its more than 40 communications plans each year.”  Id.  
at 17.   
 
As explained above, the agency evaluated Revolve’s proposal as not demonstrating 
capability to support up to 60 plans per year.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM/PNM at 18.  The agency explains that the proposal did not demonstrate its ability to handle 
the “f ull magnitude” of the government’s requirement.  COS at 11.  
 Revolve argues that the firm’s proposal demonstrated willingness and ability to produce more than 40 plans per year, and therefore, the firm demonstrated compliance with the requirement to produce up to 60 plans per year.  See  Comments at 6 -7.  The Army 
responds that the proposal did not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the requirement, and failed to provide sufficient detail regarding how it would accomplish between 40- 60 communication plans per year.  MOL at 24.  
 On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation because the RFP required offerors to articulate precisely how they would fulfill the duties outlined the PWS and our review shows that Revolve did not explain how it would develop 60 communication plans per year.  While Revolve’s proposal demonstrated an 
understanding that the selected contractor may be required to produce more than 40 plans per year, the proposal did not specifically explain that the firm would be willing and able to produce 60 plans per year.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --
Sanitized at 17.  More importantly, our review confirms the agency’s conclusion that  Page 7 B-423450  Revolve did not articulate how its capabilities would allow the firm to develop 60 plans 
per year.  Id.  Indeed, our reading of the firm’s proposal shows that the firm articulated 
its general capabilities ( e.g., having long- form and short -form planning templates), 
familiarity with the Army’s structure, and communication strategists as beneficial features, but omitted any discussion explaining how these features would fare when required to produce a significantly  higher number of plans.  See id.  at 17- 18.  G iven the 
lack of clarity and supporting information, we do not find that the agency unreasonably evaluated Revolve’s proposal.  Cf. SOC LLC, B -420806, Aug. 30, 2022, 2022 CPD 
¶ 229 at 5 (“an offeror is required to submit a well -written proposal, and if it fails to do 
so, it runs the risk that its proposal will be evaluated poorly”).  Accordingly, we deny the protest allegation.  
 
PWS Section 5.6, Army Outreach Support  
 Section 5.6 requires the contractor to provide planning and assessment support for Army outreach events.  RFP, amend. 4 at 42.  The outreach events inform and educate American communities regarding the Army’s readiness, roles, missions, capabilities, and c hallenges in areas where there is minimal Army connection.  Id.   The Army 
anticipates conducting 20 outreach events per year focused on observances and holidays, such as Asian American Pacific Islander month, Juneteenth, and the Army/Navy football game.  Id. at 42- 43.  To develop, plan, and execute these events, 
the contractor needs to conduct research considering population density patterns, media markets, top employers, universities, think tanks, and centers of influence.  Id.  
at 43. 
 
As explained earlier, the RFP advised that proposals would be evaluated based on whether they demonstrate the ability to satisfy the complexity and magnitude of all PWS functions.  RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  
 When evaluating Revolve’s proposal, the Army determined that the firm failed to address how it would execute 20 events per year. AR, Tab 5b, SSEB Report at 33.  The agency explains that Revolve’s proposal only demonstrates experience supporting outreach ev ents but does not explain how the firm would support these functions.  COS 
at 12.  Further, the agency explains that “simply citing past experiences with a different 
client and scope of work, which Revolve did in its proposal, does not demonstrate how it intends to approach the specific requirements of this contract.”  Id.  at 13.  
 Revolve argues that the Army unreasonably evaluated its proposal because it demonstrated experience supporting more than 20 outreach events per year.  Comments at 8- 9.  The Army responds that Revolve’s proposal failed to provide details 
necessary to demons trate its understanding of and ability to execute 20 events per 
year.  MOL at 25.  
 Here, we have no basis to object to the agency’s evaluation because Revolve’s proposal lacks details showing that the firm could support more than 20 outreach events per year.  Our review shows that Revolve’s proposal generally discusses its  Page 8 B-423450  understanding of the need to conduct outreach events and the firm’s standard practices.  
AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 21.  The firm then identifies past 
experiences, capabilities, supporting personnel, and strategic approach.  Id.  at 22-24.  
Consistent with the agency’s position, we do not find that the firm specifically discussed how it would tailor or modify its general standard practices to support the Army’s specific need to host 20 events per year, such as the Army -Navy football gam e; instead, 
consistent with the agency’s position, we think any reader would be required to infer how the firm would adapt its strategic approach and standard practices to supporting the Army’s requirement.  See id.   Thus, we deny the allegation because we agree with 
the agency that the firm did not articulate how it would apply its approach to the instant requirement as was required by the solicitation.

3 Revolve also argues that the Army unreasonably failed to evaluate the firm’s price 
proposal.  Comments at 9- 10.  We dismiss this allegation because the solicitation 
specified that award would be made on a LPTA basis and as demonstrated above the agency reasonably evaluated the firm’s technical approach as unacceptable.  RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  Thus, the firm’s proposal could not have been selected for award, and any alleged failure to evaluate the firm’s price was not prejudicial.  See Platinum Business Corp. , B-415584, Jan. 18, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 34 at 4 (“Competitive prejudice 
is an essential element of a viable protest and there is no basis for finding prejudice and sustaining a protest where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency’s actio ns, it would have had a substantial change of receiving the award.”).  "

DECISION  
 RiverNorth, Inc., a small business of Sterling, Virginia, protests the elimination of its 
quotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) for program support to various USDA missions, 
including farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency’s decision to eliminate its quotation for failing to comply with the solicitation’s font size requirements was (1)  unreasonable and contrary to the terms of the solicitation, 
(2) improper because it resulted from a latent ambiguity  with the terms of the 
solicitation , (3) unfair because USDA treat ed vendors unequally when it  allowed another 
vendor to correct an error with its quotation through discussions but did not also hold discussions with the protester, and (4) contrary to applicable procurement regulations DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release .

from the Small Business Administration (SBA) before eliminating its quotation and the agency failed to do so.  See  Protest at 1- 2; Supp. Protest at 1.   
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through the General Services 
Administration ’s electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the 
federal supply schedule (FSS) procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
subpart 8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Exh. 7 .2, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 47- 48; AR, Exh. 3, 
Determination of Compliance Review at 1.
1  The solicitation contemplated the 
establishment of a multiple award, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year 
period of performance.  RFQ  at 1, 48.  
 The RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to 
evaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past 
performance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach 
factor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflicts o f interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and 
risk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal 
importance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   
 Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  
 
The [vendor] ’s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the 
Government can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  
Therefore, the [vendor] ’s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of 
spelling and grammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the 
Government will expect from awardees.  The [vendor] ’s ability to  follow the 
instructions contained herein is a demonstration of the [vendor] ’s ability to  
follow instructions in general, which is paramount to acceptable performance.  
 The [vendor]’ s attention to detail is important to the Government as a 
significant amount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work 
statement]  will require the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including 
quality control.  If a[] [vendor] ’s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not 
following  the directions contained herein, the [vendor] ’s quot [ation] 
shall be ineligible for award.  
 
 
1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  RFQ at 47.  
 
The RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation required vendors to submit quotations “in accordance with the format and content specified in the solicitation.”  Id.  at 51.  Specifically, text size 
“must be 12- point or larger, using Times New Roman font” and “[o]nly page numbers, 
headers and footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, 
Times New Roman[] font requirement.  Id.      
 The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the formatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  
 
Any [Vendor][] quot[ations] determined non- compliant with the terms noted 
in this RFQ will not be evaluated and further considered for award.  I n 
addition, a quot[ation]  may be eliminated from further consideration before 
the initial rating if the quot[ation]  has one or more deficiencies . . . . 
 
* * * * * 
 
The [vendor]’s quot[ation] must include all information requested and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions.  Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to furnish a complete quot[ation] . . . shall result in the quot[ation] being unacceptable to the Government and will eliminate the [Vendor] from further 
consideration for award.  
 
* * * * * 
 
[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or 
deficient and will be considered ineligible for award.  
 
* * * * * 
 
A quot [ation]  will be deemed unacceptable if it does not represent a 
reasonable effort to address the essential requirements of the solicitation, 
or if it does not comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this 
solicitation.  
 Id. at 47-48, 51, 64.  
 In the section explaining how the agency would evaluate quotations, the solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  
  Page 4 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  A deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of 
the Request for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or 
unacceptable within this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  
[Vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is determined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s 
are cautioned to ensure all the solicitation requirements are met.   
[Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention to the details of this 
solicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] ’s ability to follow explicit instructions is 
critical to the performance of the resulting orders from this award.  
 
A quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .”  
 
* * * * * 
 
A failure to provide the information called for . . .  or a failure to provide the information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . . The evaluation of a[]  [Vendor] ’s quot [ation]  will end upon 
a determination that  the [Vendor] ’s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  
 Id. at 63-64. 
 The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s 
to determine whether quotations  were “compliant with the criteria and instructions of the 
RFQ,” unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined 
deficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law 
(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 11.2, 
Notice of E limination .   
 
After the initial compliance review of RiverNorth’s quotation, the agency determined that the protester’s quotation failed to comply with the formatting instructions because it included page numbers in font sizes less than 12- point font in the page footers of the 
“subfactor 1 portion of [its] Volume III [quotation] . . . .”  AR, Exh. 11.2, Notice of 
Elimination.   Upon notification of its elimination, RiverNorth filed this protest on 
January  10, 2025.    
 DISCUSSION  The protester alleges that the agency “acted unreasonably by improperly rejecting RiverNorth’s quot[ation] as materially  non-compliant.”  Protest at 12.  In this regard, 
RiverNorth claims the agency deviated from the solicitation’s terms when it eliminated the protester’s quotation over an “incredibly minor” and “non- material” font size in “one 
portion of one volume” of its  quotation that “could not have been anticipated from the 
express language of the RFQ.”  Id.   In the alternative, the protester contends  the 
solicitation contained a latent ambiguity.  Id. at 15.  RiverNorth also argues that the 
agency engaged in unequal treatment and lastly that the agency failed to refer its  Page 5 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  quotation to the SBA for a certificate of competency ( COC)  determination.  Supp. 
Protest at 2- 3; Protest at 12.   
 
For the reasons explained below, we find no basis to sustain any of the challenges raised by the protester.

Solicitation Formatting Instructions  
 
The protester alleges that the agency acted unreasonably and deviated from the evaluation criteria in eliminating its quotation from the competition because the 
solicitation instructions did not “clearly put [vendor]s on notice that something as non-
materi al as a font in a footer would result in quot[ation] rejection.”  Protest at 13.  
RiverNorth explains that while the solicitation discusses font size requirements, the RFQ fails to explain that non- compliance with the font formatting instructions would be 
treated as a “deficiency or as a “material non- compliance.”  Id.  By comparison, the 
protester points to other sections of the solicitation--e.g. , page limits and prohibition of 
pictures with text, that clearly inform vendors that errors would lead to a quotation deficiency.  Id.  at 14 (citing RFQ at 64).  Furthermore, the protester asserts that the 
RFQ “makes it clear” that a quotation must include multiple errors related to “directions” to be deemed ineligible.  Id. (citing RFQ at 47); Comments at 6.  Sta ted otherwise, the 
RFQ did not “directly state that a single error in font size in a footer was a criterion for automatic rejection.”  Protest at 14.    
 The agency contends that the RFQ instructions for font size and type requirements were clear and that it properly eliminated RiverNorth’s quotation because the solicitation 
warned that vendors would be ineligible for award if vendors did not comply with the 
RFQ’s detailed formatting instructions.  See Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 3 -
4.  Furthermore, the contracting officer states that the solicitation “was designed to select only those contractors capable of following detailed instructions” and t hat the 
RFQ “states the importance of a [vendor’s] ability to follow detailed instructions.”  Id.   
at 2, 6.  Moreover, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as “must” and “shall” instead of discretionary terms such as “may” which was an “intentional and deliberate deviation” from previous solicitations that was “made to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor’s] ability to follow directions.”  Id.  at 6-7.   
 Where, as here, an agency issues a solicitation to FSS vendors under the provisions of FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the establishment of a BPA, our Office will not reevaluate the quotations; rather, we review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and 
applicable procurement laws and regulations .  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches , 
Inc., B-418823.3, B -418823.4, Jan. 8, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 18 at 4.  
 
 
2 RiverNorth raises additional collateral protest arguments.  While we do not address 
every argument raised, we have considered all of the protest allegations and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  On this record, we find that the agency’s rejection of RiverNorth’s quotation was in 
accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for text size and fonts, specifically stating that “[t]ext size must be 
12-point or larger, using Times New Roman font” and “[o]nly page numbers, headers 
and footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, Times 
New Roman[] font requirement.”  RFQ at 51.   On the same page as these formatting 
instructions, the solicitation stated that “[vendors] that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non-responsive or deficient and will be considered ineligible for award.”  Id.    
 Furthermore, as noted above, t he RFQ included several other sections, emphasizing 
that failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a 
deficiency ,” which mandated elimination from the competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  
Given this language, the agency’s decision to eliminate RiverNorth’s quotation for its failure, however minor, to follow the quotation formatting instructions, was in accordance with the solicitation terms.  While the protester argues that  quotations would 
be defi cient, and eliminated, under the terms of the RFQ only if they had multiple errors, 
we do not agree with RiverNorth’s contention that the solicitation required “multiple errors” to be eliminated from the competition.  The solicitation instead referred to the 
requirement that vendors follow all solicitation instructions, and that any error attributed to a vendor’s failure to follow solicitation instructions would result in its elimination from the competition.  Stated otherwise, the plural form of errors in the RFQ instructions, “ [i]f 
a [Vendor] ’s quot [ation]  has errors attributed to not following the directions contained 
herein, the [Vendor] ’s quot [ation shall be ineligible for award,” refers to either single or 
multiple errors.  See  RFQ at 47.     
 The protester also contends that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity because it was unclear what constituted a “deficiency” that warranted rejection of a quotation.  Protest at 15.  RiverNorth argues that “the RFQ stated a deficiency could lead to quot[ation]  rejection.  However, it  doesn’t directly define such term until multiple pages 
later, indicating these two RFQ terms aren’t  even related. ”  Id.   
 In response, the agency contends that the solicitation was clear and unambiguous.  The agency maintains that RiverNorth’s argument regarding the definition of a deficiency “makes no sense, as throughout the RFQ the definition of deficiency, and its location relative to its use in the RFQ, is referenced consistently.”  MOL at 7.  
 Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation 
must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 163 at 5.  An 
ambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the terms or specifica tions of the solicitation are possible.  The HP Grp., LLC , B-415285, Dec. 14,

 Based on our review of the record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity  as 
alleged by RiverNorth.   The protester’s interpretation ignores the clear and unequivocal 
solicitation language that explained the required font size and type requirements.   See 
RFQ at 51.   As explained above, the RFQ informed vendors that “a failure to provide the 
information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency.”  RFQ at 64.  The fact that the definition of deficiency was found multiple pages after the 
solicitation first notified vendors that a deficiency would lead to elimination of a quotation does not create any ambiguity.  Moreover, as the agency points out, RiverNorth’s argument ignores the multiple different places where t he solicitation stated that failure to 
follow quotation formatting instructions would be considered a deficiency.  Consequently, the solicitation was not latently ambiguous as alleged by the protester 
and t his protest allegation is denied.  
 Unequal Treatment  
 RiverNorth alleges that the USDA treated vendors unequally by engaging in discussions with only one vendor.  Supp. Protest at 2.  In this regard, the protester contends that one of the vendors was permitted to provide explanations for why it should not have been eliminated and eventually the agency allowed that vendor back in the competition.  
Id. at 4.  RiverNorth asserts that the eliminated vendor provided:  “A detailed 
walkthrough of a quot[ation] that no other [vendor] was given the opportunity to provide.  It is essentially a presentation and argument – a sales pitch essentially –  of the RFQ 
compliance of the quot[ation], in written form.”  Supp. Comments at 4.  Furthermore, RiverNorth contends that it should have been provided the “same opportunity to revise 
its quot[ation] through discussions” to resolve “any lingering concerns from the USDA, 
including any footer text size issues found in its quot[ation].”  Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  
 As explained above, after an initial compliance review, the agency sent unsuccessful notices to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for the BPA.  As  relevant to this protest ground, the agency 
eliminated another vendor for including a chart in its quotation “as an image with text.”  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.  The unsuccessful notices to vendors, including to RiverNorth, did not request or otherwise invite a response.  However, the other vendor sent a letter to the agency arguing that its quotation was 
compliant with the solicitation and that the agency’s decision for elimination of its quotation was erroneous.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal Letter at 1.  In this regard, the vendor explained that the chart at issue was not a prohibited picture with text, but instead a chart that was “fully editable in [Microsoft] Word as text” which was compliant with solicitation instructions.  Id. at 5; s ee RFQ at 51.  The vendor asked that the agency 
reconsider its decision to eliminate the vendor’s quotation.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal  Page 8 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Letter at 1.  Following receipt and review of this vendor’s rebuttal letter, the agency 
concluded that the table was editable and permitted the vendor back in the competition.  AR, Exh. 13.2, Agency Response to Vendor Rebuttal Letter; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.   
 The protester asserts that above- described communications constituted discussions 
because the eliminated vendor’s “explanations, arguments, and sales -pitch of 
compliance and [the] RFQ terms to the USDA caused the [agency] to take separate actions to test i tems and further evaluate the quot[ation] for acceptability.”  Supp. 
Comments at 4.  In support of its argument, RiverNorth relies on our decision Spry 
Methods, Inc ., where our Office found that “discussions occur when an agency 
communicates with a vendor for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determine the acceptability of a quotation,  or provides  the vendor with an opportunity to 
revise or modify its quotation in some material respect.”   Id. at 3 (quoting Spry Methods, 
Inc.-Costs, B-417800.3, Feb.  14, 2020, 2020  CPD ¶ 83  at 6).  RiverNorth maintains that 
this constitutes unequal treatment because it was not provided with an opportunity to respond to the unsuccessful notice.       
     
In response, USDA contends that it did not engage in discussions with the re- admitted 
vendor because it did not permit the vendor to revise its quotation.  Supp. MOL at 1- 2.  
The agency explains that “the agency’s evaluation team determined that the error that 
was originally assigned to the re- admitted [vendor]’s quot[ation] was incorrectly 
assigned, as the chart include[d] in the re- admitted [vendor]’s quot[ation] was in fact not 
a prohibited picture with text.”  Id.  at 2.  Instead, the agency contends that it “upheld its 
responsibility to treat all [vendors] fairly under the RFQ instructions ” when it decided to 
re-admit the vendor.  Id.      
 There is no requirement in FAR subpart 8.4 that an agency seek clarifications or otherwise conduct discussions with vendors.  Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc.,  B-421979.4,

2017 CPD ¶ 205 at 10.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance i n making 
this determination.  Id .  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as “limited 
exchanges” that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this case quotations) or to resolve minor or clerical mistakes.  See FAR 
15.306(a)(1), (2); Diversified Collection Servs., Inc. , B-406958.3, B -406958.4, Jan. 8,

communications, or exchanges, as guidance in FSS context).   Discussions allow an 
agency  to communicate with offerors  to obtain information essential for determining the 
acceptability of proposals , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify their 
proposals .  See FAR 15.306(d); JHC Technology, Inc ., B-417786, Oct. 23, 2019, 2019

at 6-7.   
  Page 9 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Based on our review of the record, we disagree with RiverNorth’s  interpretation that 
discussions occurred here.  As provided above, discussions allow an agency  to 
communicate with vendors to obtain information essential for determining the 
acceptability of  quotations , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify  its 
quotations .  See FAR § 15.306(d); see also JHC Technology, Inc ., supra at 4-5.  Here, 
the re- admitted vendor did not change its quotation, rather, it notified the USDA of an 
error with its evaluation and requested relief.3  In comparison, RiverNorth’s quotation 
would have required a change, a correction to font size errors, to be considered 
compliant with the solicitation requirements.    Moreover, we find RiverNorth’s reliance on the Spry Methods  decision misplaced.  This 
case is distinguishable as the agency  in Spry Methods  initiated communications with the 
vendor, whereas here, the agency did not request any response from the vendors, but rather the other vendor  independently  contact ed USDA.   See Spry Methods, Inc. -Costs, 
supra at 6-8.  Furthermore, RiverNorth’s argument that the re- admitted vendor’s 
explanation of why its quotation complied with the solicitation constituted discussions ignores the “acid test” explained in Spry Methods to  determine whether discussions 
have occurred --e.g. , “whether a vendor has been afforded an opportunity to revise or 
modify its quotation.”  Id.  at 6.  Here, the eliminated vendor did not revise or modify its 
quotation in response to the unsuccessful notice.  On this record, RiverNorth has failed to establish that the agency engaged in unequal discussions or treatment; as a result, this protest al legation is denied.   
 SBA Referral   
Finally, RiverNorth asserts that the agency could not eliminate its quotation without first 
referring its eligibility for award to the  SBA for a COC determination.  Protest at 19 -20.  
The protester alleges that USDA eliminated its quotation based on a “pass/fail” basis that was aimed at capability and responsibility and therefore it is analogous to a 
responsibility determination that required the agency to refer the protester to the SBA for a COC.  Id.  at 19; Comments at 14.  The agency contends it was not required to 
seek a COC as RiverNorth’s quotation was eliminated for failing to follow the solicitation’s instructions, rather than a matter of responsibility.  COS at 7; MOL at 11-12. 
 Under the SBA’s COC program, agencies must refer a determination that a small business is not responsible to the SBA, if that determination would preclude the small 
 
3 In this regard, we find that the re- admitted vendor’s notice to the USDA is more 
analogous to an agency -level protest, where the re- admitted vendor identified an error 
with the agency evaluation and requested relief .  See Science & Tech. Corp.,  
B-420216, Jan.  3, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 1 at 5 (concluding that “to be regarded as a 
protest, a written statement need not state explicitly that it is or is intended to be a protest, but must convey the intent to protest by a specific expression of dissatisfaction with the agency’s procurement actions and a request for relief ”).

pass/fail, go/no go, or  acceptable/unacceptable) under one or more responsibility type 
evaluation factors (such as experience of the company or key personnel or past performanc e).”  13 C.F.R. § 125.5(a)(2)(ii); EA Engineering, Sci. & Tech. Inc., 
B-417361, B -417361.2, June 13, 2019 ,2019 CPD ¶ 218 at 9.   
 Where an agency rejects a quotation as technically unacceptable on the basis of factors not related to responsibility, however, referral to the SBA is not required.  See EA 
Engineering, Sci. & Tech.  Inc., supra.  Along these same lines, where an agency finds a 
quotation to be unacceptable based on a vendor’s failure to adhere to the solicitation’s font size instructions,  the finding does not constitute a determination that the vendor is 
not a responsible prospective contractor.  Id.     
 On the record here, we do not agree with the protester’s assertion that the agency’s rejection of its quotation involved a responsibility determination that required referral to the SBA.  The elimination of RiverNorth’s quotation because it failed to follow solicitation instructions regarding quotation formatting is not elimination under a responsibility type evaluation factor.  Accordingly, the agency was not required to refer the protester to the SBA for a COC and we deny this protest ground.  
 
The protest is denied.

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest challenging the agency’s rejection of the protester’s quotation is denied where the agency reasonably eliminated the protester’s quotation in accordance with the solicitation requirements . 
 2.  Protest alleging unequal treatment because the agency engaged in discussions with 
only one vendor is denied where the record shows that the agency did not engage in discussions.   3.  Protest alleging that the agency was required to refer the firm’s eligibility for award to the Small Business Administration for a certificate of competency determination is 
denied where the agency ’s elimination of the protester’s quotation for failure to comply 
with solicitation instructions did not constitute a responsibilit y determination. 
DECISION  
 RiverNorth, Inc., a small business of Sterling, Virginia, protests the elimination of its 
quotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) for program support to various USDA missions, 
including farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency’s decision to eliminate its quotation for failing to comply with the solicitation’s font size requirements was (1)  unreasonable and contrary to the terms of the solicitation, 
(2) improper because it resulted from a latent ambiguity  with the terms of the 
solicitation , (3) unfair because USDA treat ed vendors unequally when it  allowed another 
vendor to correct an error with its quotation through discussions but did not also hold discussions with the protester, and (4) contrary to applicable procurement regulations DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release .

 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through the General Services 
Administration ’s electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the 
federal supply schedule (FSS) procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
subpart 8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Exh. 7 .2, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 47- 48; AR, Exh. 3, 
Determination of Compliance Review at 1.
1  The solicitation contemplated the 
establishment of a multiple award, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year 
period of performance.  RFQ  at 1, 48.  
 The RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to 
evaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past 
performance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach 
factor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflicts o f interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and 
risk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal 
importance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   
 Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  
 
The [vendor] ’s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the 
Government can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  
Therefore, the [vendor] ’s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of 
spelling and grammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the 
Government will expect from awardees.  The [vendor] ’s ability to  follow the 
instructions contained herein is a demonstration of the [vendor] ’s ability to  
follow instructions in general, which is paramount to acceptable performance.  
 The [vendor]’ s attention to detail is important to the Government as a 
significant amount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work 
statement]  will require the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including 
quality control.  If a[] [vendor] ’s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not 
following  the directions contained herein, the [vendor] ’s quot [ation] 
shall be ineligible for award.  
 
 
1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  RFQ at 47.  
 
The RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation required vendors to submit quotations “in accordance with the format and content specified in the solicitation.”  Id.  at 51.  Specifically, text size 
“must be 12- point or larger, using Times New Roman font” and “[o]nly page numbers, 
headers and footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, 
Times New Roman[] font requirement.  Id.      
 The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the formatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  
 
Any [Vendor][] quot[ations] determined non- compliant with the terms noted 
in this RFQ will not be evaluated and further considered for award.  I n 
addition, a quot[ation]  may be eliminated from further consideration before 
the initial rating if the quot[ation]  has one or more deficiencies . . . . 
 
* * * * * 
 
The [vendor]’s quot[ation] must include all information requested and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions.  Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to furnish a complete quot[ation] . . . shall result in the quot[ation] being unacceptable to the Government and will eliminate the [Vendor] from further 
consideration for award.  
 
* * * * * 
 
[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or 
deficient and will be considered ineligible for award.  
 
* * * * * 
 
A quot [ation]  will be deemed unacceptable if it does not represent a 
reasonable effort to address the essential requirements of the solicitation, 
or if it does not comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this 
solicitation.  
 Id. at 47-48, 51, 64.  
 In the section explaining how the agency would evaluate quotations, the solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  
  Page 4 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  A deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of 
the Request for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or 
unacceptable within this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  
[Vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is determined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s 
are cautioned to ensure all the solicitation requirements are met.   
[Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention to the details of this 
solicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] ’s ability to follow explicit instructions is 
critical to the performance of the resulting orders from this award.  
 
A quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .”  
 
* * * * * 
 
A failure to provide the information called for . . .  or a failure to provide the information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . . The evaluation of a[]  [Vendor] ’s quot [ation]  will end upon 
a determination that  the [Vendor] ’s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  
 Id. at 63-64. 
 The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s 
to determine whether quotations  were “compliant with the criteria and instructions of the 
RFQ,” unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined 
deficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law 
(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 11.2, 
Notice of E limination .   
 
After the initial compliance review of RiverNorth’s quotation, the agency determined that the protester’s quotation failed to comply with the formatting instructions because it included page numbers in font sizes less than 12- point font in the page footers of the 
“subfactor 1 portion of [its] Volume III [quotation] . . . .”  AR, Exh. 11.2, Notice of 
Elimination.   Upon notification of its elimination, RiverNorth filed this protest on 
January  10, 2025.    
 DISCUSSION  The protester alleges that the agency “acted unreasonably by improperly rejecting RiverNorth’s quot[ation] as materially  non-compliant.”  Protest at 12.  In this regard, 
RiverNorth claims the agency deviated from the solicitation’s terms when it eliminated the protester’s quotation over an “incredibly minor” and “non- material” font size in “one 
portion of one volume” of its  quotation that “could not have been anticipated from the 
express language of the RFQ.”  Id.   In the alternative, the protester contends  the 
solicitation contained a latent ambiguity.  Id. at 15.  RiverNorth also argues that the 
agency engaged in unequal treatment and lastly that the agency failed to refer its  Page 5 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  quotation to the SBA for a certificate of competency ( COC)  determination.  Supp. 
Protest at 2- 3; Protest at 12.   
 
For the reasons explained below, we find no basis to sustain any of the challenges raised by the protester.
 2 
 
Solicitation Formatting Instructions  
 
The protester alleges that the agency acted unreasonably and deviated from the evaluation criteria in eliminating its quotation from the competition because the 
solicitation instructions did not “clearly put [vendor]s on notice that something as non-
materi al as a font in a footer would result in quot[ation] rejection.”  Protest at 13.  
RiverNorth explains that while the solicitation discusses font size requirements, the RFQ fails to explain that non- compliance with the font formatting instructions would be 
treated as a “deficiency or as a “material non- compliance.”  Id.  By comparison, the 
protester points to other sections of the solicitation--e.g. , page limits and prohibition of 
pictures with text, that clearly inform vendors that errors would lead to a quotation deficiency.  Id.  at 14 (citing RFQ at 64).  Furthermore, the protester asserts that the 
RFQ “makes it clear” that a quotation must include multiple errors related to “directions” to be deemed ineligible.  Id. (citing RFQ at 47); Comments at 6.  Sta ted otherwise, the 
RFQ did not “directly state that a single error in font size in a footer was a criterion for automatic rejection.”  Protest at 14.    
 The agency contends that the RFQ instructions for font size and type requirements were clear and that it properly eliminated RiverNorth’s quotation because the solicitation 
warned that vendors would be ineligible for award if vendors did not comply with the 
RFQ’s detailed formatting instructions.  See Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 3 -
4.  Furthermore, the contracting officer states that the solicitation “was designed to select only those contractors capable of following detailed instructions” and t hat the 
RFQ “states the importance of a [vendor’s] ability to follow detailed instructions.”  Id.   
at 2, 6.  Moreover, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as “must” and “shall” instead of discretionary terms such as “may” which was an “intentional and deliberate deviation” from previous solicitations that was “made to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor’s] ability to follow directions.”  Id.  at 6-7.   
 Where, as here, an agency issues a solicitation to FSS vendors under the provisions of FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the establishment of a BPA, our Office will not reevaluate the quotations; rather, we review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and 
applicable procurement laws and regulations .  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches , 
Inc., B-418823.3, B -418823.4, Jan. 8, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 18 at 4.  
 
 
2 RiverNorth raises additional collateral protest arguments.  While we do not address 
every argument raised, we have considered all of the protest allegations and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  On this record, we find that the agency’s rejection of RiverNorth’s quotation was in 
accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for text size and fonts, specifically stating that “[t]ext size must be 
12-point or larger, using Times New Roman font” and “[o]nly page numbers, headers 
and footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, Times 
New Roman[] font requirement.”  RFQ at 51.   On the same page as these formatting 
instructions, the solicitation stated that “[vendors] that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non-responsive or deficient and will be considered ineligible for award.”  Id.    
 Furthermore, as noted above, t he RFQ included several other sections, emphasizing 
that failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a 
deficiency ,” which mandated elimination from the competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  
Given this language, the agency’s decision to eliminate RiverNorth’s quotation for its failure, however minor, to follow the quotation formatting instructions, was in accordance with the solicitation terms.  While the protester argues that  quotations would 
be defi cient, and eliminated, under the terms of the RFQ only if they had multiple errors, 
we do not agree with RiverNorth’s contention that the solicitation required “multiple errors” to be eliminated from the competition.  The solicitation instead referred to the 
requirement that vendors follow all solicitation instructions, and that any error attributed to a vendor’s failure to follow solicitation instructions would result in its elimination from the competition.  Stated otherwise, the plural form of errors in the RFQ instructions, “ [i]f 
a [Vendor] ’s quot [ation]  has errors attributed to not following the directions contained 
herein, the [Vendor] ’s quot [ation shall be ineligible for award,” refers to either single or 
multiple errors.  See  RFQ at 47.     
 The protester also contends that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity because it was unclear what constituted a “deficiency” that warranted rejection of a quotation.  Protest at 15.  RiverNorth argues that “the RFQ stated a deficiency could lead to quot[ation]  rejection.  However, it  doesn’t directly define such term until multiple pages 
later, indicating these two RFQ terms aren’t  even related. ”  Id.   
 In response, the agency contends that the solicitation was clear and unambiguous.  The agency maintains that RiverNorth’s argument regarding the definition of a deficiency “makes no sense, as throughout the RFQ the definition of deficiency, and its location relative to its use in the RFQ, is referenced consistently.”  MOL at 7.  
 Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation 
must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 163 at 5.  An 
ambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the terms or specifica tions of the solicitation are possible.  The HP Grp., LLC , B-415285, Dec. 14, 
2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 385 at 5.  A patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error, while a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.   Where  Page 7 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  there is a latent ambiguity, both parties’ interpretations of the provision may be 
reasonable, and the appropriate course of action is to clarify the requirement and afford offerors an opportunity to submit proposals based on the clarified requirement.  Qwest Gov’t Servs., Inc . d/b/a CenturyLink QGS , B-419597, B -419597.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 
CPD ¶ 217 at 5 n.7.  
 Based on our review of the record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity  as 
alleged by RiverNorth.   The protester’s interpretation ignores the clear and unequivocal 
solicitation language that explained the required font size and type requirements.   See 
RFQ at 51.   As explained above, the RFQ informed vendors that “a failure to provide the 
information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency.”  RFQ at 64.  The fact that the definition of deficiency was found multiple pages after the 
solicitation first notified vendors that a deficiency would lead to elimination of a quotation does not create any ambiguity.  Moreover, as the agency points out, RiverNorth’s argument ignores the multiple different places where t he solicitation stated that failure to 
follow quotation formatting instructions would be considered a deficiency.  Consequently, the solicitation was not latently ambiguous as alleged by the protester 
and t his protest allegation is denied.  
 Unequal Treatment  
 RiverNorth alleges that the USDA treated vendors unequally by engaging in discussions with only one vendor.  Supp. Protest at 2.  In this regard, the protester contends that one of the vendors was permitted to provide explanations for why it should not have been eliminated and eventually the agency allowed that vendor back in the competition.  
Id. at 4.  RiverNorth asserts that the eliminated vendor provided:  “A detailed 
walkthrough of a quot[ation] that no other [vendor] was given the opportunity to provide.  It is essentially a presentation and argument – a sales pitch essentially –  of the RFQ 
compliance of the quot[ation], in written form.”  Supp. Comments at 4.  Furthermore, RiverNorth contends that it should have been provided the “same opportunity to revise 
its quot[ation] through discussions” to resolve “any lingering concerns from the USDA, 
including any footer text size issues found in its quot[ation].”  Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  
 As explained above, after an initial compliance review, the agency sent unsuccessful notices to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for the BPA.  As  relevant to this protest ground, the agency 
eliminated another vendor for including a chart in its quotation “as an image with text.”  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.  The unsuccessful notices to vendors, including to RiverNorth, did not request or otherwise invite a response.  However, the other vendor sent a letter to the agency arguing that its quotation was 
compliant with the solicitation and that the agency’s decision for elimination of its quotation was erroneous.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal Letter at 1.  In this regard, the vendor explained that the chart at issue was not a prohibited picture with text, but instead a chart that was “fully editable in [Microsoft] Word as text” which was compliant with solicitation instructions.  Id. at 5; s ee RFQ at 51.  The vendor asked that the agency 
reconsider its decision to eliminate the vendor’s quotation.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal  Page 8 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Letter at 1.  Following receipt and review of this vendor’s rebuttal letter, the agency 
concluded that the table was editable and permitted the vendor back in the competition.  AR, Exh. 13.2, Agency Response to Vendor Rebuttal Letter; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.   
 The protester asserts that above- described communications constituted discussions 
because the eliminated vendor’s “explanations, arguments, and sales -pitch of 
compliance and [the] RFQ terms to the USDA caused the [agency] to take separate actions to test i tems and further evaluate the quot[ation] for acceptability.”  Supp. 
Comments at 4.  In support of its argument, RiverNorth relies on our decision Spry 
Methods, Inc ., where our Office found that “discussions occur when an agency 
communicates with a vendor for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determine the acceptability of a quotation,  or provides  the vendor with an opportunity to 
revise or modify its quotation in some material respect.”   Id. at 3 (quoting Spry Methods, 
Inc.-Costs, B-417800.3, Feb.  14, 2020, 2020  CPD ¶ 83  at 6).  RiverNorth maintains that 
this constitutes unequal treatment because it was not provided with an opportunity to respond to the unsuccessful notice.       
     
In response, USDA contends that it did not engage in discussions with the re- admitted 
vendor because it did not permit the vendor to revise its quotation.  Supp. MOL at 1- 2.  
The agency explains that “the agency’s evaluation team determined that the error that 
was originally assigned to the re- admitted [vendor]’s quot[ation] was incorrectly 
assigned, as the chart include[d] in the re- admitted [vendor]’s quot[ation] was in fact not 
a prohibited picture with text.”  Id.  at 2.  Instead, the agency contends that it “upheld its 
responsibility to treat all [vendors] fairly under the RFQ instructions ” when it decided to 
re-admit the vendor.  Id.      
 There is no requirement in FAR subpart 8.4 that an agency seek clarifications or otherwise conduct discussions with vendors.  Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc.,  B-421979.4,

2017 CPD ¶ 205 at 10.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance i n making 
this determination.  Id .  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as “limited 
exchanges” that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this case quotations) or to resolve minor or clerical mistakes.  See FAR 
15.306(a)(1), (2); Diversified Collection Servs., Inc. , B-406958.3, B -406958.4, Jan. 8,

communications, or exchanges, as guidance in FSS context).   Discussions allow an 
agency  to communicate with offerors  to obtain information essential for determining the 
acceptability of proposals , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify their 
proposals .  See FAR 15.306(d); JHC Technology, Inc ., B-417786, Oct. 23, 2019, 2019

at 6-7.   
  Page 9 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Based on our review of the record, we disagree with RiverNorth’s  interpretation that 
discussions occurred here.  As provided above, discussions allow an agency  to 
communicate with vendors to obtain information essential for determining the 
acceptability of  quotations , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify  its 
quotations .  See FAR § 15.306(d); see also JHC Technology, Inc ., supra at 4-5.  Here, 
the re- admitted vendor did not change its quotation, rather, it notified the USDA of an 
error with its evaluation and requested relief.3  In comparison, RiverNorth’s quotation 
would have required a change, a correction to font size errors, to be considered 
compliant with the solicitation requirements.    Moreover, we find RiverNorth’s reliance on the Spry Methods  decision misplaced.  This 
case is distinguishable as the agency  in Spry Methods  initiated communications with the 
vendor, whereas here, the agency did not request any response from the vendors, but rather the other vendor  independently  contact ed USDA.   See Spry Methods, Inc. -Costs, 
supra at 6-8.  Furthermore, RiverNorth’s argument that the re- admitted vendor’s 
explanation of why its quotation complied with the solicitation constituted discussions ignores the “acid test” explained in Spry Methods to  determine whether discussions 
have occurred --e.g. , “whether a vendor has been afforded an opportunity to revise or 
modify its quotation.”  Id.  at 6.  Here, the eliminated vendor did not revise or modify its 
quotation in response to the unsuccessful notice.  On this record, RiverNorth has failed to establish that the agency engaged in unequal discussions or treatment; as a result, this protest al legation is denied.   
 SBA Referral   
Finally, RiverNorth asserts that the agency could not eliminate its quotation without first 
referring its eligibility for award to the  SBA for a COC determination.  Protest at 19 -20.  
The protester alleges that USDA eliminated its quotation based on a “pass/fail” basis that was aimed at capability and responsibility and therefore it is analogous to a 
responsibility determination that required the agency to refer the protester to the SBA for a COC.  Id.  at 19; Comments at 14.  The agency contends it was not required to 
seek a COC as RiverNorth’s quotation was eliminated for failing to follow the solicitation’s instructions, rather than a matter of responsibility.  COS at 7; MOL at 11-12. 
 Under the SBA’s COC program, agencies must refer a determination that a small business is not responsible to the SBA, if that determination would preclude the small 
 
3 In this regard, we find that the re- admitted vendor’s notice to the USDA is more 
analogous to an agency -level protest, where the re- admitted vendor identified an error 
with the agency evaluation and requested relief .  See Science & Tech. Corp.,  
B-420216, Jan.  3, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 1 at 5 (concluding that “to be regarded as a 
protest, a written statement need not state explicitly that it is or is intended to be a protest, but must convey the intent to protest by a specific expression of dissatisfaction with the agency’s procurement actions and a request for relief ”).

officer to refer a small business concern to the SBA for a COC determination when the 
contracting officer has refused to consider a small business concern for award of a 
contract or order “after evaluating the concern’ s offer on a non- comparative basis ( e.g., 
pass/fail, go/no go, or  acceptable/unacceptable) under one or more responsibility type 
evaluation factors (such as experience of the company or key personnel or past performanc e).”  13 C.F.R. § 125.5(a)(2)(ii); EA Engineering, Sci. & Tech. Inc., 
B-417361, B -417361.2, June 13, 2019 ,2019 CPD ¶ 218 at 9.   
 Where an agency rejects a quotation as technically unacceptable on the basis of factors not related to responsibility, however, referral to the SBA is not required.  See EA 
Engineering, Sci. & Tech.  Inc., supra.  Along these same lines, where an agency finds a 
quotation to be unacceptable based on a vendor’s failure to adhere to the solicitation’s font size instructions,  the finding does not constitute a determination that the vendor is 
not a responsible prospective contractor.  Id.     
 On the record here, we do not agree with the protester’s assertion that the agency’s rejection of its quotation involved a responsibility determination that required referral to the SBA.  The elimination of RiverNorth’s quotation because it failed to follow solicitation instructions regarding quotation formatting is not elimination under a responsibility type evaluation factor.  Accordingly, the agency was not required to refer the protester to the SBA for a COC and we deny this protest ground.  
 
The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the award of a contract to Continental Maritime of San Diego, LLC (CMSD), of San Diego, California, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N00024- 24-R- 4429, issued by the 
Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, for ship repair and alteration 
services for the USS Russell.  BAE alleges that the agency’s evaluation of offerors’ 
proposals and subsequent source selection decision were improper.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The Navy issued the RFP on May 30, 2024, under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15, seeking proposals to provide ship maintenance, repair, and modernization DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423271  services--referred to as a “docking selected restricted availability ” (DSRA) or, more 
generally, as an “availability” --for the naval vessel USS Russell under the Chief of Naval 
Operations (CNO).  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law 
(COS/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at  1, 175.1  The solicitation required 
the successful contractor to furnish the material, support, and facilities --as well as to 
provide the management, technical, procurement, production, testing, and quality assurance services --necessary to prepare and accomplish r epairs and alterations for 
the USS Russell in accordance with the solicitation.  RFP at  4, 70.  The solicitation 
contemplated the award of a fixed- price contract with a 14- month period of 
performance.  COS/MOL at  2; RFP at  116-120.   
 Basis for Award and General Evaluation Criteria  The solicitation advised that award would be made to the responsible offeror whose 
proposal conformed to the solicitation requirements and represented the best value to 
the government in a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1)  technical 
eligibility and physical resource capacity; (2)  manpower and small business 
participation; (3)  schedule and execution approach; (4) past performance; and (5)  price.  
RFP at  196.  The manpower and small business factor was comprised of two 
subfactors:  (a)  manpower; and (b)  small business participation.  Id.      
 
The RFP provided that the agency would first evaluate proposals under the technical 
eligibility and physical resource capacity factor and the past performance factor as 
either acceptable or unacceptable.  Id. at 197.  If a proposal was found to be 
unacceptable under either factor, the agency reserved the right to not further evaluate 
that proposal.  Id.   For the evaluation under the remaining non- price factors and 
subfactors, the agency would use the adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, 
acceptable, marginal, and unacceptable.  Id.  at 197, 204- 205.  For the purpose of a 
tradeoff, the manpower and small business participation factor and the schedule and execution approach factor were equal in importance.  Id. at 197.  Under the manpower 
and small business participation factor, the manpower subfactor was more important 
than the small business participation subfactor.  Id.  The non- price factors, when 
combined, were considered significantly more important than price.  Id.  
 
Limitation on Government -Operated Dry Docks  
 
As relevant here, the solicitation permitted each offeror to submit two different types of 
proposals --where proposal volume A would be for performance at an offeror’s private 
facility and proposal volume B would be for performance at the government -provided 
dock at the Naval Base San Diego--“[i]n support of maintaining compliance with 
Section  126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.”  RFP

solicitation are to the conformed RFP provided by the agency at tab 1 of its report.  
Citations to the record are to the Adobe PDF page numbers.   Page 3 B-423271  at 197.  Section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, in 
relevant part, provides as follows:  
 
SEC. 126.  Limitation on Consideration of Government -Operated Dry 
Docks in Certain Contract Solicitations.  
 
(a)  In General .— With respect to a solicitation of the Secretary of the 
Navy for the award of a contract for private sector non- nuclear surface 
ship maintenance in San Diego, California, the Secretary shall ensure, in accordance with section 2466 of title 10, United States  Code, that 
Government -operated dry docks are only included in such solicitation if 
there is insufficient capacity at privately -operated dry docks for 
performance of such contract.  
 Pub. L. No. 118- 31, § 126, 137 Stat. 136, 170 -171 (2023).  Offerors were permitted to 
submit just a volume A proposal, just a volume B proposal, or both proposal volumes A and B.  RFP at  177.  The solicitation provided that proposal volumes  A and B “shall be 
evaluated at the same time,” and further specified as f ollows:  
 
All Volume A proposals shall be considered for award before all Volume B proposals.  Volume A proposals must be found at least acceptable under 
all Non -Price Factors and include fair and reasonable pricing in the 
context of all submitted proposals.  If no Volume A proposal results in a 
selection, all Volume B proposals will be considered for award in accordance with [the RFP’s] Section M criteria. 
 Id. at 197.   
 Offerors submitting volume A proposals were required to provide specific information 
under the technical eligibility and physical resource capacity factor to demonstrate their ability to provide sufficient capacity to perform the requirement at a privately -operated 
dry dock.  Id. at 183-184.  The required information included:  (1)  a completed eligibility 
criteria data sheet (RFP attach. S -5); (2) a completed execution milestones and key 
event dates attachment (RFP attach.  J-3) with a signed letter “identif ying and confirming 
ownership” of the proposed pier and dry dock for the proposed milestone dates; (3) a current dry dock certification for the proposed dry dock; (4)  a completed pier and 
dry dock graphical representation (RFP attach. S -8); and (5)  a narra tive in support of 
the graphical representation.  Id. 
 In the eligibility criteria data sheet, offerors were required to “identif[y] the specific pier and drydock at the contractor facility intended to be used for the proposed availability and indicate[] that the pier and drydock meet the minimum characteristi cs.”  Id. at 183.  
The signed letter was to “identify[] and confirm[] ownership of . . .  a drydock capable of 
docking the vessel”  for the performance period specified in the execution milestone and 
key event dates attachment.  Id .  In the pier and dry dock  graphical representation 
attachment, offerors were required to “demonstrate the Offeror has the pier and dry  Page 4 B-423271  dock capable for completing the requirement s of the proposed availability,” and to show 
the “piers and dry docks expected to be in working capacity ,” including the “awarded 
and outstanding projects and work [that are] using those resources.”  Id. at 183-184.  
The narrative in support of the pier and dry dock graphical representation was to include 
plans to resolve any pier and dry dock resource conflicts arising from proposed and 
awarded projects.  Id.  at 184.  The RFP advised that “[p]iers and dry docks mu st not be 
committed to multiple ships during the same time period without explanation.”  Id. 
 For volume A  proposals,  evaluations under the technical eligibility and physical resource 
capacity factor would assess whether the offeror “has ownership or committed access to . . . a dry dock (Volume A) capable of docking the vessel . . . as outlined in the [offeror’s] Execution Milestones & Key Events (Attachment J -3),” and whether the 
proposed dry dock had the required certification.  Id.  at 199.  The solicitation also 
provided that the agency would assess “whether the proposal demonstrates the Offeror’s capability to provide the required physical resources to complete the 
availability” with an “emphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated 
physical resource conflicts.”  Id.   To that end, the RFP stated that the agency would 
assess whether the offeror’s pier and dry dock graphical representation showed the offeror’s awarded and outstanding projects using those physical resources to assess “[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the solicited availability’s docking resources.”  Id.   
 Manpower Evaluation Scheme  
 As relevant here, under the manpower subfactor of the manpower and small business 
participation factor, the solicitation sought “specified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.”  Id.  at 184.  
Offerors were to provide this information by completing a manpower performance data sheet, provided as solicitation attachment S -4, as well as submitting detailed manpower 
charts and manpower narratives.  Id. at 184-186.  The manpower data sheets required 
detaile d monthly data on “all projects,” defined as follows:  
 
Navy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which 
the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy 
project) which were active (on- going or compl eted) or planned (awarded 
or proposed) (including the proposal for this solicitation) during the first 
month identified in Attachment S -4A & S- 4B and the Contract Complete 
Date of this solicitation .   
 
Id. at 184.  Offerors were advised that their manpower data sheets “must capture all 
work performed by the Offeror within the shipyard and at the local Naval  
Station, if the Offeror’s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.”  Id.  
Manpower charts, required in the form of stacked area graphs, were to show the total current and forecasted full -time equivalent (FTE) resources for all projects identified in 
the data sheet.  Id. at 185.  In addition, the RFP instructed offerors to submit manpower  Page 5 B-423271  narratives “describing and quantifying” the information in the manpower data sheet and 
manpower charts and to explain the offeror’s plans to “adjust or maintain the current workforce to achieve the proposed forecasted FTE levels.”  Id.  
 The solicitation advised that offerors’ manpower proposals would be evaluated to “assess the quality and risk of the Offeror’s plan to provide efficient manpower to successfully complete the availability’s requirements with a focus on workload assessment, labor composition and the associated narrative.”  Id.  at 199.  For this 
assessment, the agency would use the offeror’s data to calculate its current and projected FTEs for the “Minimum Workload Forecast and [the] Maximum Workload 
Forecast.”  Id . at 200.  A  current  FTE count  that is more than 50 FTEs below  the 
forecasted FTE count would be assessed as a weakness “unless the narrative 
demonstrated that the FTE s is not a risk under the circumstances proposed,” while a 
shortfall greater than or equal to 200 FTEs would be assessed as appreciably 
increasing risk.  Id.  The solicitation further provided that the assessment would 
examine the “reasonableness and effectiveness of the Offeror’s approach,” with a specific focus on “[e]xplanations and mitigations of weak nesses ” in the offeror’s “ FTE 
and Labor Composition.”  Id. at 201. 
 Evaluation and Award  
 The agency received four timely submitted proposals.  COS/MOL at  4.  BAE submitted 
both a volume A proposal and a volume B proposal; CMSD and another offeror submitted just volume B proposals.  After evaluation, the agency assigned the following ratings to the proposals submitted by BAE and CMSD:

 With respect to considerations under section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, the source selection authority (SSA) noted that, because “BAE was the only Offeror that proposed a private sector dock, and the proposed dock i s 
considered ‘utilized’ . . ., preference was not given to filling unused private sector dock capacity.”  AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at  1.  In this

RUSSELL tandem docked with the USS GREEN BAY (LPD 20), another outstanding 
project. ”  AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board ( SSEB)  Report at  6.  The 
SSEB identified the tandem docking scenario as a “potential physical resource conflict 
in the event USS GREEN BAY is awarded to BAE” and that BAE’s narrative “ did not 
provide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources issue 
other than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking [guided- missile 
destroyer ( DDG )] and [littoral combat ship ( LCS)] class ships.”  Id.   In this regard, noting 
that the USS Green Bay was a landing platform dock  (LPD) class ship while the USS 
Russell was a DDG class ship, the SSAB concluded that BAE’s POCA dock could not accommodate the combined lengths and widths of the two ships.  AR, Tab  6, SSAC 
Report at  4.  Based on this conclusion, the SSAC found that the “technical risk is 
increased without further analysis of how BAE would conduct a docking of both USS GREEN BAY and USS RUSSELL at the same time.”   Id.  The SSAC concluded that 
BAE’s volume A proposal “did not warrant preferential consideration” because BAE ’s 
“proposed a private sector dock that will be encumbered with USS GREEN BAY”  and 
thus did not offer sufficient capacity at a privately -operated dry dock for the performance 
of the USS Russell requirement.
 2  Id. at 5-6.   
 After reviewing the underlying evaluation and consulting with the SSAC, the SSA concluded that CMSD’s volume B proposal represented the best value to the 
government.  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  1, 3.  Specifically, in comparing the volume B 
proposals of BAE and CM SD, the SSA noted that BAE’s proposal received one strength 
and one significant weakness under the manpower subfactor, while CMSD’s proposal was assessed two strengths and no weaknesses.  Id. at 2.  The significant weakness 
was “due to [BAE’s] projected av ailable FTEs not exceeding their current onboard 
average labor resulting in a shortfall of [DELETED]  FTE[s] for the maximum workload 
scenario.”  Id.  Noting that CMSD has the highest rated non- price proposal, the SSA 
concluded that a price premium of 7 percent was “worth the benefit to the Government 
to ensure sufficient manpower is available to support the successful execution of the work.”  Id. 
 Based on this conclusion, the agency awarded the contract to CMSD and notified BAE of the award decision on November 29.  COS/MOL at  6.  After receiving a debriefing, 
BAE filed this protest.  
 DISCUSSION  
 BAE first challenges the agency’s decision to consider volume B proposals, alleging that the agency erroneously rejected BAE’s volume A proposal based on an unreasonable assessment of BAE’s proposed dry dock capacity.  Protest at  19-27.  BAE also argues  
that the agency evaluated proposals unreasonably and disparately under the manpower

Evaluation of BAE’s Volume A Proposal  
 
The protester alleges that the agency’s decision to reject BAE’s technically acceptable 
and reasonably priced volume A proposal and to instead proceed with considering volume B proposals for award was erroneous and violates section 126 of the National 
Defe nse Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.  Protest at  19-27; Comments at  12-20.  
In this regard, the protester argues that the agency unreasonably assessed the 
available capacity at BAE’s proposed private dry dock by misinterpreting BAE’s 
proposal as off ering “tandem docking.”  Id.   The protester also contends that the agency 
improperly ignored BAE’s proposed “deconflict strategy” of using another BAE -owned 
private dry dock, Pride of San Diego (POSD).  Id.  The agency responds that it 
evaluated BAE’s volume A proposal in accordance with the solicitation and reasonably 
determined that BAE’s proposed dry dock was encumbered by another project and 
therefore was not available for performance of the instant requirement.  COS/MOL

As noted above, the solicitation instructed offerors to complete the pier and dry dock graphical representation attachment to “demonstrate the Offeror has the pier and 
drydock capable for completing the requirements of the proposed availability” and to 
 
3 While our decision does not discuss every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them all and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 8 B-423271  show “piers and dry docks expected to be in working capacity by month” including the 
“awarded and outstanding projects and work using those resources.”  RFP at  183-184.  
With regard to the graphical representation, the solicitation also specifically advised that “[p]iers and dry docks must not be committed to multiple ships during the same time period without explanation.”  Id. at 184.  Moreover, the solicitation stated that the 
agency would review the offeror’s pier and dry dock graphical representation attachment specifically to assess “[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the 
solicited availability’s docking resources.”  Id. at 199.    
 While the protester repeatedly asserts that it did not propose the tandem docking of the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay, see Protest at  24 n.5, Comments at  13-19, its 
proposal is not clear in this regard.  Rather, BAE’s proposal included information that reasonably led the agency to conclude that BAE was proposing to dock both ships at POCA during the same period.  Specifically,  BAE’s pier and dry dock graphical 
representation clearly showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay positioned at the PO CA dock for the same period without any explanation except to note generally 
that “[f]inal pier assignments will be determined at the time of contract award, due to execution of bidder’s firm work and other proposed awards.”  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, 
Technic al Proposal at  9.  Moreover, in its 10 -page volume A technical proposal, BAE 
more than once touted its POCA dock’s tandem docking capabilities --specifically, its 
ability to accommodate a DD G class ship and a LCS class ship at the same time--to  
“maximize dr ydocking capacity of the homeport.”  Id. at 3, 10.   
 Without any additional explanation in BAE’s proposal for its graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay docked at POCA during the 
same period, we see no basis to fault the agency’s conclusion that BAE was proposing tandem docking of the two ships.  Moreover, the agency informed BAE that it was the only offeror for the USS Green Bay contract more than a month before the due date for proposal submissions here.  On this record, we find that it was incumbent upon BAE to 
provide an adequate explanation to resolve the apparent conflict caused by both ships 
being proposed at POCA for the same period.  The burden of submitting an adequately written proposal falls on the offeror, and the offeror runs the risk that its proposal will be evaluated unfavorably when it fails to meet this burden.  Amentum Servs ., Inc. , VS2, 
LLC, B-418742.3 et al. , Sept.  30, 2021, 2021  CPD ¶ 334 at 9.  
 Further, we find no support in the record for the protester’s assertion that the agency unreasonably ignored BAE’s proposal of the POSD dry dock as an alternative dry dock.  In this regard, the protester asserts that its proposal met solicitation requirements by confirming the availability of another BAE -owned dry dock capable of performing the 
requirement and by promising to make final dock assignments at contract award to meet “all other contract schedule and facility requirements/ provisions.”  See Protest 
at 22-26; Comments at  13-19.  The protester argues that it thereby proposed “to 
perform the USS RUSSELL availability in the POSD drydock if the POCA drydock was encumbered.”  Comments at  14.  The record, however, does not support the protester’s 
assertions in this regard.   
  Page 9 B-423271  Instead, the record shows that BAE’s volume A proposal unequivocally proposed the 
POCA dry dock --and only the POCA dry dock --for the solicited work.  See COS/MOL 
at 11-13; AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical Proposal at  3 (“BAE Systems will be utilizing 
the Pride of California (POCA) Drydock and Pier  [DELETED] .”); 8 (“The RUSSELL 
DSRA docking period will be performed in BAE Systems’ Pride of California (POCA) drydock.”).  In this regard, all of the information BAE included in its proposal to demonstrate the technical merit of its proposed private dry dock identified only POCA by name (to the extent any dock was identified by name) as the dry dock being proposed for the solicited work.  Indeed, BAE’s eligibility criteria data sheet, execution milestone and key event dates attachment, dry dock certification, and pier and dry dock graphical representation all identified POCA as the proposed dry dock.  See id.  at 4, 6, 8, 9.   
 Moreover, BAE’s proposal never expressly proposed the POSD dry dock as a means to resolve a potential schedule conflict at the POCA dry dock.  In this regard, the record shows that BAE’s volume A technical narrative included several general statements about BAE’s ownership of two certified dry docks and its plan to make “[f]inal private dock and pier assignments  . . . at the time of contract award, due to execution of 
bidder’s firm work and other proposal awards.”  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical 
Proposal at 3, 9, 10.  BAE’s proposal, however, does not specifically propose POSD as 
a dry dock with capacity to perform the solicited requirements, as an alternative or otherwise.  See generally, id.   
 As a matter of fact, the term “POSD” or “Pride of San Diego” appears only once in BAE’s volume A technical proposal:  as a graphical entry in BAE’s pier and dry dock graphical representation.  Id.  at 9.  In that representation, however, POSD is shown as 
occupied by proposed work on another ship, the USS [DELETED] , during the period of 
performance for the USS Russell.  Id.  As noted above, that same graphical 
representation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay occupying the POCA dry dock during that same period.  Id.  at 9.  In sum, for the applicable period, 
BAE’s graphical representation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock and the USS [DELETED] at the POSD dock.  Id.   Moreover, just as 
no specific explanation was offered for the graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock, no additional explanation was provided with respect to the graphical representation showing that P OSD was occupied 
by work on another  outstanding proposal.  In this regard, the “Resource Conflicts” 
portion of BAE’s proposal simply acknowledged that BAE “currently has outstanding proposals,” including for work on the USS Green Bay and the USS [DELETED] , but did 
not mention POSD or any other specific de- conflicting plan, other than a general 
promise to “take[] reasonable and responsible steps to ensure the resources will be available to perform awarded work.”  Id. at 10.   
 On this record, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that BAE’s proposal “did not provide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources 
issue other than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking DDG and LCS class  ships.”  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  6.  As noted, the solicitation advised that 
“[p]iers and dry docks must not be committed to multiple ships during the same time  Page 10 B-423271  period without explanation” and that the agency would assess the offeror’s “capability to 
provide the required physical resources” with an “emphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated physical resource conflicts.”  RFP at  184, 199.  Here, 
BAE’s proposal provided no specific explanation or plan to address the potential conflict arising from the apparent commitment of multiple ships at the POCA dry dock.  Accordingly, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the POCA dock was unavailable.  Moreover, because BAE never expressly proposed the POSD dock to 
resolve conflicts at the POCA dock, other than a graphical representation showing the POSD dock occupied by another outstanding project, we find that the agency reasonably did not  consider the POSD dock as BAE’s proposed deconflicting strategy.  
 We therefore find no basis to object to the agency’s conclusion that BAE’s proposed private dry dock was “utilized” and did not offer sufficient capacity to perform the requirement for the USS Russell.  See AR, Tab  7, SSDD at  1.  Based on this 
conclusion, the agency reasonably decided to proceed with the consideration of volume B proposals to perform at a government dock without giving preferential 
treatment to BAE’s volume A proposal.    Evaluation of Volume B Proposals  
 BAE also contends that, even if the agency was justified in considering volume B proposals for award, the agency unreasonably and unequally evaluated those proposals under the manpower subfactor (of the manpower and small business participation factor).  S pecifically, the protester alleges that the agency unreasonably ignored 
information in BAE’s proposal in assessing a significant weakness for a significant 
shortfall in the firm’s manpower forecast.  Protest at  33-48; Comments at  21-41.  The 
protester also argues that the agency erroneously failed to consider a manpower 
shortfall arising from CMSD’s subcontract work on aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at 48-53; Comments at  41-49.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to 
object to the agenc y’s evaluation.  
  Evaluation of BAE’s Manpower Proposal  
 The protester challenges the Navy’s assessment of a significant weakness in BAE’s  
manpower proposal, asserting that the agency unreasonably ignored relevant information in BAE’s proposal.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency’s manpower calculations improperly excluded BAE’s proposed manpower from the firm’s projects in [DELETED] and [DELETED] , resulting in a projected shortfall of 
[DELETED]  FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Protest at  33-48; Comments 
at 21-41.  The protester argues t hat the agency similarly ignored BAE’s proposed use of 
affiliate resources and other mitigating measures that would have alleviated any concerns about a projected manpower shortage.  Id.  The agency responds that its 
evaluation properly excluded information about BAE’s affiliated entities and reasonably assessed a significant weakness for an unmitigated and significant shortfall in BAE’s manpower proposal.  COS/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6.   
  Page 11 B-423271  The record shows that, using the data in BAE’s manpower performance data sheet, the 
agency calculated BAE’s projected maximum workload scenario to require at least [DELETED]  FTEs, while also calculating BAE’s available “Current Yard- Wide
4 FTE” as 
[DELETED] FTEs.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  22-23.  Based on these calculations, the 
agency found that BAE’s current yard- wide workforce would result in a manpower 
shortfall of [DELETED] FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Id.  at 23.  
Assessing a significant weakness for this projected manpower shortfall, the agency concluded that BAE’s “in[ -]progress project performance and current yard[ -]wide FTE 
levels indicate a high risk of competition for resources that significantly incr eases the 
likelihood the  offeror will not have the manpower resources to perform as planned.”  Id.    
 The protester argues that the agency’s calculations unreasonably excluded the enterprise workforce data for its affiliate entities identified in BAE’s data sheet as two projects:  “Project 20 representing the ongoing and projected repair work at BAE 
System s’ [DELETED] shipyard, and Project  23 representing ongoing and projected 
repair work at BAE Systems’ [DELETED] facility.”  Comments at 23.  The protester 
contends that the agency was required to consider this information because the 
solicitation did not li mit the data sheet information that could be submitted to projects 
located at the local shipyard.   
 The agency responds that it properly did not consider data about the protester’s affiliate 
entities in the manpower calculation.  In this regard, the agency contends that the 
solicitation clearly sought data about “all work performed by the Offeror within the 
shipyard and at the local Naval Station.”  COS/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6; 
see RFP at  184-185.  The agency also argues that the protester’s affiliate entities, in 
[DELETED] and [DELETED] , were not the “Offeror” for BAE’s proposal, and the 
solicitation required information about all projects “for which the Offeror  is the prime or a 
major subcontractor” at the “ Offeror’s ” shipyard.  Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6.   
 
Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s actual requirements, we will first examine 
the plain language of the solicitation.  DAI Global, LLC , B-416992, Jan.  17, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 25 at  4.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of 
solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole 
and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore 
valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole 
and in a reasonable manner .  Crew Training Int ’l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb.  7, 2017, 
2017 CPD ¶ 53 at  4.  A proposed interpretation of solicitation language would be 
 
4 Although the solicitation does not define the term “Yard -Wide,” the agency contends 
that the term was intended to limit the offeror’s FTE data to those “within the [offeror’s] shipyard and at the local Naval Station, if the Offeror’s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.”  Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6.  The protester disputes the agency’s 
interpretation, arguing that the term could mean within any of the offeror’s shipyards.  Protester’s Supp.  Comments at  18-19.  As further discussed below, we need not 
address this issue in this decision.   Page 12 B-423271  unreasonable insofar as it would render other solicitation language superfluous.  See 
Anders Constr ., Inc., B-414261, Apr.  11, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 121 at  3-4. 
 Here, the protester’s argument that the solicitation did not prohibit manpower data from outside the local San Diego shipyard wholly disregards the detailed solicitation instructions to complete the data sheet and manpower charts with specific, project -based data.  As noted, the solicitation provided a detailed definition of 
“projects” --as “Navy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which 
the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor” --and instructed offerors to provide 
specific, detailed information about each project in the format provided in solicitation attachment  S-4.  RFP at  184-185.  The solicitation further informed offerors that the 
agency would use this detailed, project -specific  data to calculate the offeror’s projected 
workload needs and the manpower available for meeting those needs, calculated as the offeror’s historical and current yard- wide FTEs.  Id. at 200.   
 The specific entries that the protester alleges should have been included in the calculations did not satisfy this definition of “projects” because they:  (1) did not present data for discrete projects; and (2) represented the combined workforce data for t wo of 
the protester’s affiliate entities, rather than projects “for which the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor.”
5  RFP at 184; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, Appendix B, BAE’s 
Manpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE’s Manpower and Small 
Business Participation Proposal at  6-7.  More specifically, despite being included in the 
manpower data sheet as “Project  20” and “Project  23,” respectively, the entries for “BAE 
Systems [DELETED] Ship Repair” and “BAE Systems [DELETED] Ship Repair” 
provided summarized data for BAE’s affiliate entities,  “depict [ing] recent actual 
performance and forecasted manhour requirements ,” reflecting the purported resources 
of those affiliate entities  rather than discrete projects.  See AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, 
Appendix B, BAE’s Manpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE’s 
Manpower and Small Business Participation Proposal at  10.  Moreover, as the agency 
notes, the offeror in the protester’s proposal is BAE  Systems San Diego Ship Repair, 
Inc., of San Diego, California, not BAE’s affiliate entities in [DELETED] and [DELETED] .  
Supp. COS/MOL at 5-6.  On this record, we find no basis to conclude that the agency 
unreasonably excluded the data about BAE’s affiliate entities from its evaluation of BAE’s manpower.
 6    
 
5 In contrast, the record shows that BAE followed the solicitation instructions when it 
identified and provided required data for the [DELETED] discrete shipyard projects in its 
manpower data sheet, e.g.,  the USS Russell as project [DELETED] , the USS Green 
Bay as project  [DELETED] , and the USS [DELETED]  as project  [DELETED] .   
6 Because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not elaborate on why the 
agency excluded the disputed data in its calculations, BAE  contends that the agency ’s 
post-protest explanations  offer an impermissible post-hoc interpretation of the 
solicitation that should be afforded little weight.  In our view,  however,  the agency ’s 
response provides a credible and consistent rationale for the Navy’s contemporaneous 
decision to disregard the manpower data for BAE’s affiliate entities .  Wackenhut Servs., 
(continued...)   Page 13 B-423271   
We also find no basis to question the SSEB’s conclusion that BAE’s manpower narrative “did not provide a sufficient explanation for overcoming the manning shortfall calculated by Navy’s Projected Workload via the provided BAE attachment S -4.”  AR, 
Tab 4, SSEB Report  at 24.  While the protester argues that the mitigation approaches 
detailed in its manpower narrative --i.e., its hiring initiative, enterprise resource sharing, 
and subcontracting approach--should have alleviated any concern about BAE’s manpower shortfall, Protest at  40-48, Comments at  29-41, the protester’s arguments in 
this regard amount to nothing more than disagreement with the agency’s reasonable evaluation.    The record shows that the agency specifically considered each mitigation approach proposed in BAE’s manpower narrative to determine whether the approach sufficiently mitigated the significant weakness of BAE’s projected manpower shortage.  AR, Tab 4, 
SSEB Report  at 24.  For example, the SSEB considered BAE’s “attempt[] to mitigate 
hiring actions by hiring trades starting in March 2024” and found that BAE’s narrative did “not state the progress with this hiring initiative to the date of their USS RUSSELL proposal r eceipt.”  Id.  The agency further explains that, while BAE’s narrative stated 
that it “initiated a hiring plan” by hiring “ [DELETED] BAE Systems and temporary labor 
personnel since 03/01/2024” and planned to hire an “additional [DELETED] trade 
personnel” by December 2024, it did not explain whether its manpower charts included those [DELETED] additional FTEs or provide any detail about its plan to hire 
[DELETED] more FTEs in just three months (from September 16 to December 2024).  
Supp. COS/MOL at 6 n.7; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, BAE’s Manpower and Small 
Business Participation Proposal at  9.  While the protester now presents additional 
information by providing interim recruitment dates and even a new chart purportedly “based directly on the data provided in the hiring approach discussi on” in BAE’s 
proposal, these additional details were not included in the proposal that the agency evaluated.  Comments at  35; see generally, AR, Tab  2, Vol. 2B, BAE’s Manpower and 
Small Business Participation Proposal.    Therefore, on this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s reasoned conclusion that BAE’s manpower narrative did not provide sufficient information to overcome the risk presented by the assessed manpower shortage of [DELETED] 
FTEs.
7  As noted above, the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency’s 
 
Inc., B-286037, B -286037.2, Nov. 14, 2000, 2001 CPD ¶ 114 at 4- 5 (“While we 
generally accord greater weight to contemporaneous evidence, we will consider post-protest explanations that provide a rationale for contemporaneous conclusions, so 
long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record. ”).  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the agency ’s explanation constitutes  
an impermissible post-hoc rationalization . 
7 Although the protester also argues that various mitigating approaches in its manpower 
narrative should have at least improved the risk presented from a significant weakness 
(continued...)   Page 14 B-423271  discretion; a  protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment, without more, is 
insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  See Vertex Aerospace, 
LLC, supra.  
 
 Evaluation of CMSD’s Manpower Proposal  
 The protester also contends that the agency evaluated manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally by calculating manpower without considering CMSD’s subcontract work on various aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at  48-53; Comments 
at 41-49.  Specifically, the protester alleges that publicly available information shows 
that CMSD has undertaken a significant manpower commitment from certain aircraft carrier subcontract work which, if included in the manpower performance calculations, would have resulted in a significant, forecasted shortage in CMSD’s manpower.  Id.    
 For the purpose of the evaluation under the manpower subfactor, the solicitation required offerors to provide “specified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.”  RFP at  184.  The required workload 
data was to be provided for all projects “for which the Offeror is the prime or a major 
subcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy project).”  Id.  The record shows that the SSEB assigned a rating 
of good to CMSD’s manpower proposal based on two strengths assigned for calculations showing a manpower surplus of over [DELETED] FTEs under both the 
maximum and the minimum workload scenarios.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report  at 24. 
 The protester asserts, based on information it obtained from “public sources,” that 
CMSD improperly omitted data about its subcontract work on two aircraft carrier projects from its manpower data sheet and charts.  Protest at  48-53; Comments 
at 41-49; Supp. Comments at  13-16.  BAE contends that the agency unreasonably 
ignored this omission during its evaluation of CMSD’s manpower despite references to this work in CMSD’s proposal.  Id.  The protester argues that, had CMSD included these projects in its manpower data sheet and manpower charts, the calculations would show a projected manpower shortage rather than a surplus.  Id. 
 The agency responds that it reasonably did not consider the workforce data for CMSD’s aircraft carrier subcontract work when evaluating CMSD’s manpower proposal.  COS/MOL at 21; Supp. COS/MOL at  1-2.  In this regard, the agency notes that the 
solicitation did not require offerors to explain why work was excluded from the 
manpower data sheet and that the Navy had no reason to question CMSD’s decision on what information was included in its proposal.  Supp. COS/MOL at  2.  The agency also 
notes that CMSD’s proposal nevertheless did explain why it did not include the aircraft carrier subcontract work by explaining that it carries additional FTEs to support subcontracted work not required to be reported under this solicitation.  Id., citing AR, 
 
to a weakness, the protester’s disagreement with the agency in this regard also fails to establish that the agency’s judgment was unreasonable.   Page 15 B-423271  Tab 3b, Vol.  2B-7, CMSD’s Manpower Narrative at  3.  Based on our review of the 
record, we agree with the agency.  
 
As an initial matter, while the solicitation required offerors to provide data about projects for which they were “the prime or a major subcontractor” (defined as performing 30 percent or more of the work), it did not require offerors to provide any inform ation 
about subcontractor projects below that threshold.  RFP at  184.  Specifically, the 
protester appears to suggest that CMSD was required to provide detailed data about its aircraft carrier subcontract work and then allow the agency to confirm that CMSD  was 
performing less than 30 percent of the work, see Supp. Comments at  16, but the 
solicitation included no such requirement.  Rather, the solicitation relied on the offeror to provide the required information for projects that met the applicable solicitation definition, and advised that the manpower evaluation would be based on the information provided in the offeror’s proposal.
8  RFP at  184-186, 199- 201.  To the extent an offeror 
determined that a particular work effort did not meet the threshold criteria for projects required to be included in the proposal, nothing in the solicitation required the Navy to investigate beyond the four corners of the proposal  to question that determination.  
 In any event, the record shows that CMSD’s proposal informed the agency that its aircraft carrier subcontract work did not fall within the definition of projects required to be included in the proposal.  In addition to explaining that it “ carries additional organic 
FTEs to support other subcontracted work that is  less than the 30 [percent]  of a CNO  
availability required for reporting [in accordance with]  this solicitation ,” CMSD 
specifically referred to its aircraft carrier subcontract work as “ additional ” work that was 
not required to be “reported”  in its manpower proposal.  See AR, Tab  3b, Vol.  2B-7, 
CMSD’s Manpower Narrative at  1 (“In addition to supporting the [DELETED] 
[availabilities], CMSD is presently supporting the following availability . . .”); 2  (“CMSD’s 
still has additional  labor force available not accounted for in the scheduled FTEs 
currently supporting non- Prime [aircraft carrier] availabilities. . . . [fiscal year] 22 Q3 and 
Q4 FTEs continue to increase with a peak of [DELETED] FTEs in November 2022 for 
reported availabilities, plus an additional  [DELETED] FTE supporting [aircraft carrier] 
projects for a total of [DELETED] CMSD FTEs .”) (emphasis added).  On this record, we 
find that the agency reasonably did not consider CMSD’s additional aircraft carrier 
 
8 The protester also complains that the agency’s post -protest explanation in this regard 
offers various theories about CMSD’s aircraft carrier subcontract work without any contemporaneous evaluation documentation about this work, and thus constitutes an impermissible post-hoc rationalization.  See Supp. Comments at  1-16.  As our Office 
has noted, we do not expect an agency ’s evaluation report to “prove a negative. ”  See 
BillSmart Solutions, LLC, B -413272.4, B -413272.5, Oct.  23, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 325 
at 14 n.19.   Thus, there was no requirement for the agency  to document why it did not 
consider information that the solicitation did not require to be included in an offeror’s proposal, and which the awardee did not, in fact, include.   Page 16 B-423271  project manpower data, which fell outside the definition of projects required to be 
included in the offerors’ manpower charts and data sheets.9   
 We similarly find that the protester’s allegation that the Navy evaluated manpower disparately is unsupported by this record.  In this regard, the agency did not consider 
this non- major subcontractor work in its manpower evaluation just as the agency 
declined to include BAE’s affiliate manpower data (which, as discussed above, also 
didn’t satisfy the solicitation requirements) in the calculations.  Accordingly, we find no 
basis to sustain the protest.

 1.  Protest challenging agency’s conclusion that protester did not demonstrate sufficient capacity at its privately -operated dry dock  to qualify for an award preference is denied 
where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  
 2.  Protest alleging that agency evaluated offerors’ manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally is denied where the protester’s assertions are not supported by the record.  
DECISION  
 BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the award of a contract to Continental Maritime of San Diego, LLC (CMSD), of San Diego, California, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N00024- 24-R- 4429, issued by the 
Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, for ship repair and alteration 
services for the USS Russell.  BAE alleges that the agency’s evaluation of offerors’ 
proposals and subsequent source selection decision were improper.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The Navy issued the RFP on May 30, 2024, under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15, seeking proposals to provide ship maintenance, repair, and modernization DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423271  services--referred to as a “docking selected restricted availability ” (DSRA) or, more 
generally, as an “availability” --for the naval vessel USS Russell under the Chief of Naval 
Operations (CNO).  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law 
(COS/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at  1, 175.1  The solicitation required 
the successful contractor to furnish the material, support, and facilities --as well as to 
provide the management, technical, procurement, production, testing, and quality assurance services --necessary to prepare and accomplish r epairs and alterations for 
the USS Russell in accordance with the solicitation.  RFP at  4, 70.  The solicitation 
contemplated the award of a fixed- price contract with a 14- month period of 
performance.  COS/MOL at  2; RFP at  116-120.   
 Basis for Award and General Evaluation Criteria  The solicitation advised that award would be made to the responsible offeror whose 
proposal conformed to the solicitation requirements and represented the best value to 
the government in a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1)  technical 
eligibility and physical resource capacity; (2)  manpower and small business 
participation; (3)  schedule and execution approach; (4) past performance; and (5)  price.  
RFP at  196.  The manpower and small business factor was comprised of two 
subfactors:  (a)  manpower; and (b)  small business participation.  Id.      
 
The RFP provided that the agency would first evaluate proposals under the technical 
eligibility and physical resource capacity factor and the past performance factor as 
either acceptable or unacceptable.  Id. at 197.  If a proposal was found to be 
unacceptable under either factor, the agency reserved the right to not further evaluate 
that proposal.  Id.   For the evaluation under the remaining non- price factors and 
subfactors, the agency would use the adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, 
acceptable, marginal, and unacceptable.  Id.  at 197, 204- 205.  For the purpose of a 
tradeoff, the manpower and small business participation factor and the schedule and execution approach factor were equal in importance.  Id. at 197.  Under the manpower 
and small business participation factor, the manpower subfactor was more important 
than the small business participation subfactor.  Id.  The non- price factors, when 
combined, were considered significantly more important than price.  Id.  
 
Limitation on Government -Operated Dry Docks  
 
As relevant here, the solicitation permitted each offeror to submit two different types of 
proposals --where proposal volume A would be for performance at an offeror’s private 
facility and proposal volume B would be for performance at the government -provided 
dock at the Naval Base San Diego--“[i]n support of maintaining compliance with 
Section  126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.”  RFP

relevant part, provides as follows:  
 
SEC. 126.  Limitation on Consideration of Government -Operated Dry 
Docks in Certain Contract Solicitations.  
 
(a)  In General .— With respect to a solicitation of the Secretary of the 
Navy for the award of a contract for private sector non- nuclear surface 
ship maintenance in San Diego, California, the Secretary shall ensure, in accordance with section 2466 of title 10, United States  Code, that 
Government -operated dry docks are only included in such solicitation if 
there is insufficient capacity at privately -operated dry docks for 
performance of such contract.  
 Pub. L. No. 118- 31, § 126, 137 Stat. 136, 170 -171 (2023).  Offerors were permitted to 
submit just a volume A proposal, just a volume B proposal, or both proposal volumes A and B.  RFP at  177.  The solicitation provided that proposal volumes  A and B “shall be 
evaluated at the same time,” and further specified as f ollows:  
 
All Volume A proposals shall be considered for award before all Volume B proposals.  Volume A proposals must be found at least acceptable under 
all Non -Price Factors and include fair and reasonable pricing in the 
context of all submitted proposals.  If no Volume A proposal results in a 
selection, all Volume B proposals will be considered for award in accordance with [the RFP’s] Section M criteria. 
 Id. at 197.   
 Offerors submitting volume A proposals were required to provide specific information 
under the technical eligibility and physical resource capacity factor to demonstrate their ability to provide sufficient capacity to perform the requirement at a privately -operated 
dry dock.  Id. at 183-184.  The required information included:  (1)  a completed eligibility 
criteria data sheet (RFP attach. S -5); (2) a completed execution milestones and key 
event dates attachment (RFP attach.  J-3) with a signed letter “identif ying and confirming 
ownership” of the proposed pier and dry dock for the proposed milestone dates; (3) a current dry dock certification for the proposed dry dock; (4)  a completed pier and 
dry dock graphical representation (RFP attach. S -8); and (5)  a narra tive in support of 
the graphical representation.  Id. 
 In the eligibility criteria data sheet, offerors were required to “identif[y] the specific pier and drydock at the contractor facility intended to be used for the proposed availability and indicate[] that the pier and drydock meet the minimum characteristi cs.”  Id. at 183.  
The signed letter was to “identify[] and confirm[] ownership of . . .  a drydock capable of 
docking the vessel”  for the performance period specified in the execution milestone and 
key event dates attachment.  Id .  In the pier and dry dock  graphical representation 
attachment, offerors were required to “demonstrate the Offeror has the pier and dry  Page 4 B-423271  dock capable for completing the requirement s of the proposed availability,” and to show 
the “piers and dry docks expected to be in working capacity ,” including the “awarded 
and outstanding projects and work [that are] using those resources.”  Id. at 183-184.  
The narrative in support of the pier and dry dock graphical representation was to include 
plans to resolve any pier and dry dock resource conflicts arising from proposed and 
awarded projects.  Id.  at 184.  The RFP advised that “[p]iers and dry docks mu st not be 
committed to multiple ships during the same time period without explanation.”  Id. 
 For volume A  proposals,  evaluations under the technical eligibility and physical resource 
capacity factor would assess whether the offeror “has ownership or committed access to . . . a dry dock (Volume A) capable of docking the vessel . . . as outlined in the [offeror’s] Execution Milestones & Key Events (Attachment J -3),” and whether the 
proposed dry dock had the required certification.  Id.  at 199.  The solicitation also 
provided that the agency would assess “whether the proposal demonstrates the Offeror’s capability to provide the required physical resources to complete the 
availability” with an “emphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated 
physical resource conflicts.”  Id.   To that end, the RFP stated that the agency would 
assess whether the offeror’s pier and dry dock graphical representation showed the offeror’s awarded and outstanding projects using those physical resources to assess “[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the solicited availability’s docking resources.”  Id.   
 Manpower Evaluation Scheme  
 As relevant here, under the manpower subfactor of the manpower and small business 
participation factor, the solicitation sought “specified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.”  Id.  at 184.  
Offerors were to provide this information by completing a manpower performance data sheet, provided as solicitation attachment S -4, as well as submitting detailed manpower 
charts and manpower narratives.  Id. at 184-186.  The manpower data sheets required 
detaile d monthly data on “all projects,” defined as follows:  
 
Navy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which 
the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy 
project) which were active (on- going or compl eted) or planned (awarded 
or proposed) (including the proposal for this solicitation) during the first 
month identified in Attachment S -4A & S- 4B and the Contract Complete 
Date of this solicitation .   
 
Id. at 184.  Offerors were advised that their manpower data sheets “must capture all 
work performed by the Offeror within the shipyard and at the local Naval  
Station, if the Offeror’s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.”  Id.  
Manpower charts, required in the form of stacked area graphs, were to show the total current and forecasted full -time equivalent (FTE) resources for all projects identified in 
the data sheet.  Id. at 185.  In addition, the RFP instructed offerors to submit manpower  Page 5 B-423271  narratives “describing and quantifying” the information in the manpower data sheet and 
manpower charts and to explain the offeror’s plans to “adjust or maintain the current workforce to achieve the proposed forecasted FTE levels.”  Id.  
 The solicitation advised that offerors’ manpower proposals would be evaluated to “assess the quality and risk of the Offeror’s plan to provide efficient manpower to successfully complete the availability’s requirements with a focus on workload assessment, labor composition and the associated narrative.”  Id.  at 199.  For this 
assessment, the agency would use the offeror’s data to calculate its current and projected FTEs for the “Minimum Workload Forecast and [the] Maximum Workload 
Forecast.”  Id . at 200.  A  current  FTE count  that is more than 50 FTEs below  the 
forecasted FTE count would be assessed as a weakness “unless the narrative 
demonstrated that the FTE s is not a risk under the circumstances proposed,” while a 
shortfall greater than or equal to 200 FTEs would be assessed as appreciably 
increasing risk.  Id.  The solicitation further provided that the assessment would 
examine the “reasonableness and effectiveness of the Offeror’s approach,” with a specific focus on “[e]xplanations and mitigations of weak nesses ” in the offeror’s “ FTE 
and Labor Composition.”  Id. at 201. 
 Evaluation and Award  
 The agency received four timely submitted proposals.  COS/MOL at  4.  BAE submitted 
both a volume A proposal and a volume B proposal; CMSD and another offeror submitted just volume B proposals.  After evaluation, the agency assigned the following ratings to the proposals submitted by BAE and CMSD:  
 
 
AR, Tab  6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at  3. 
 With respect to considerations under section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, the source selection authority (SSA) noted that, because “BAE was the only Offeror that proposed a private sector dock, and the proposed dock i s 
considered ‘utilized’ . . ., preference was not given to filling unused private sector dock capacity.”  AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at  1.  In this 
regard, the agency found that BAE’s proposal of the Pride of California (POCA) dry  BAE - A BAE - B CMSD - B

RUSSELL tandem docked with the USS GREEN BAY (LPD 20), another outstanding 
project. ”  AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board ( SSEB)  Report at  6.  The 
SSEB identified the tandem docking scenario as a “potential physical resource conflict 
in the event USS GREEN BAY is awarded to BAE” and that BAE’s narrative “ did not 
provide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources issue 
other than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking [guided- missile 
destroyer ( DDG )] and [littoral combat ship ( LCS)] class ships.”  Id.   In this regard, noting 
that the USS Green Bay was a landing platform dock  (LPD) class ship while the USS 
Russell was a DDG class ship, the SSAB concluded that BAE’s POCA dock could not accommodate the combined lengths and widths of the two ships.  AR, Tab  6, SSAC 
Report at  4.  Based on this conclusion, the SSAC found that the “technical risk is 
increased without further analysis of how BAE would conduct a docking of both USS GREEN BAY and USS RUSSELL at the same time.”   Id.  The SSAC concluded that 
BAE’s volume A proposal “did not warrant preferential consideration” because BAE ’s 
“proposed a private sector dock that will be encumbered with USS GREEN BAY”  and 
thus did not offer sufficient capacity at a privately -operated dry dock for the performance 
of the USS Russell requirement.
 2  Id. at 5-6.   
 After reviewing the underlying evaluation and consulting with the SSAC, the SSA concluded that CMSD’s volume B proposal represented the best value to the 
government.  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  1, 3.  Specifically, in comparing the volume B 
proposals of BAE and CM SD, the SSA noted that BAE’s proposal received one strength 
and one significant weakness under the manpower subfactor, while CMSD’s proposal was assessed two strengths and no weaknesses.  Id. at 2.  The significant weakness 
was “due to [BAE’s] projected av ailable FTEs not exceeding their current onboard 
average labor resulting in a shortfall of [DELETED]  FTE[s] for the maximum workload 
scenario.”  Id.  Noting that CMSD has the highest rated non- price proposal, the SSA 
concluded that a price premium of 7 percent was “worth the benefit to the Government 
to ensure sufficient manpower is available to support the successful execution of the work.”  Id. 
 Based on this conclusion, the agency awarded the contract to CMSD and notified BAE of the award decision on November 29.  COS/MOL at  6.  After receiving a debriefing, 
BAE filed this protest.  
 DISCUSSION  
 BAE first challenges the agency’s decision to consider volume B proposals, alleging that the agency erroneously rejected BAE’s volume A proposal based on an unreasonable assessment of BAE’s proposed dry dock capacity.  Protest at  19-27.  BAE also argues  
that the agency evaluated proposals unreasonably and disparately under the manpower

Russell were due on September  16) that it was the sole offeror for the USS Green Bay

without more, is insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Vertex

Evaluation of BAE’s Volume A Proposal  
 
The protester alleges that the agency’s decision to reject BAE’s technically acceptable 
and reasonably priced volume A proposal and to instead proceed with considering volume B proposals for award was erroneous and violates section 126 of the National 
Defe nse Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.  Protest at  19-27; Comments at  12-20.  
In this regard, the protester argues that the agency unreasonably assessed the 
available capacity at BAE’s proposed private dry dock by misinterpreting BAE’s 
proposal as off ering “tandem docking.”  Id.   The protester also contends that the agency 
improperly ignored BAE’s proposed “deconflict strategy” of using another BAE -owned 
private dry dock, Pride of San Diego (POSD).  Id.  The agency responds that it 
evaluated BAE’s volume A proposal in accordance with the solicitation and reasonably 
determined that BAE’s proposed dry dock was encumbered by another project and 
therefore was not available for performance of the instant requirement.  COS/MOL 
at 7-14.  As discussed below, we agree with the agency.  
 It is an offeror’s responsibility to submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed 
information which allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Peraton, Inc. ,

As noted above, the solicitation instructed offerors to complete the pier and dry dock graphical representation attachment to “demonstrate the Offeror has the pier and 
drydock capable for completing the requirements of the proposed availability” and to 
 
3 While our decision does not discuss every argument raised by the protester, we have 
considered them all and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 8 B-423271  show “piers and dry docks expected to be in working capacity by month” including the 
“awarded and outstanding projects and work using those resources.”  RFP at  183-184.  
With regard to the graphical representation, the solicitation also specifically advised that “[p]iers and dry docks must not be committed to multiple ships during the same time period without explanation.”  Id. at 184.  Moreover, the solicitation stated that the 
agency would review the offeror’s pier and dry dock graphical representation attachment specifically to assess “[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the 
solicited availability’s docking resources.”  Id. at 199.    
 While the protester repeatedly asserts that it did not propose the tandem docking of the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay, see Protest at  24 n.5, Comments at  13-19, its 
proposal is not clear in this regard.  Rather, BAE’s proposal included information that reasonably led the agency to conclude that BAE was proposing to dock both ships at POCA during the same period.  Specifically,  BAE’s pier and dry dock graphical 
representation clearly showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay positioned at the PO CA dock for the same period without any explanation except to note generally 
that “[f]inal pier assignments will be determined at the time of contract award, due to execution of bidder’s firm work and other proposed awards.”  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, 
Technic al Proposal at  9.  Moreover, in its 10 -page volume A technical proposal, BAE 
more than once touted its POCA dock’s tandem docking capabilities --specifically, its 
ability to accommodate a DD G class ship and a LCS class ship at the same time--to  
“maximize dr ydocking capacity of the homeport.”  Id. at 3, 10.   
 Without any additional explanation in BAE’s proposal for its graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay docked at POCA during the 
same period, we see no basis to fault the agency’s conclusion that BAE was proposing tandem docking of the two ships.  Moreover, the agency informed BAE that it was the only offeror for the USS Green Bay contract more than a month before the due date for proposal submissions here.  On this record, we find that it was incumbent upon BAE to 
provide an adequate explanation to resolve the apparent conflict caused by both ships 
being proposed at POCA for the same period.  The burden of submitting an adequately written proposal falls on the offeror, and the offeror runs the risk that its proposal will be evaluated unfavorably when it fails to meet this burden.  Amentum Servs ., Inc. , VS2, 
LLC, B-418742.3 et al. , Sept.  30, 2021, 2021  CPD ¶ 334 at 9.  
 Further, we find no support in the record for the protester’s assertion that the agency unreasonably ignored BAE’s proposal of the POSD dry dock as an alternative dry dock.  In this regard, the protester asserts that its proposal met solicitation requirements by confirming the availability of another BAE -owned dry dock capable of performing the 
requirement and by promising to make final dock assignments at contract award to meet “all other contract schedule and facility requirements/ provisions.”  See Protest 
at 22-26; Comments at  13-19.  The protester argues that it thereby proposed “to 
perform the USS RUSSELL availability in the POSD drydock if the POCA drydock was encumbered.”  Comments at  14.  The record, however, does not support the protester’s 
assertions in this regard.   
  Page 9 B-423271  Instead, the record shows that BAE’s volume A proposal unequivocally proposed the 
POCA dry dock --and only the POCA dry dock --for the solicited work.  See COS/MOL 
at 11-13; AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical Proposal at  3 (“BAE Systems will be utilizing 
the Pride of California (POCA) Drydock and Pier  [DELETED] .”); 8 (“The RUSSELL 
DSRA docking period will be performed in BAE Systems’ Pride of California (POCA) drydock.”).  In this regard, all of the information BAE included in its proposal to demonstrate the technical merit of its proposed private dry dock identified only POCA by name (to the extent any dock was identified by name) as the dry dock being proposed for the solicited work.  Indeed, BAE’s eligibility criteria data sheet, execution milestone and key event dates attachment, dry dock certification, and pier and dry dock graphical representation all identified POCA as the proposed dry dock.  See id.  at 4, 6, 8, 9.   
 Moreover, BAE’s proposal never expressly proposed the POSD dry dock as a means to resolve a potential schedule conflict at the POCA dry dock.  In this regard, the record shows that BAE’s volume A technical narrative included several general statements about BAE’s ownership of two certified dry docks and its plan to make “[f]inal private dock and pier assignments  . . . at the time of contract award, due to execution of 
bidder’s firm work and other proposal awards.”  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical 
Proposal at 3, 9, 10.  BAE’s proposal, however, does not specifically propose POSD as 
a dry dock with capacity to perform the solicited requirements, as an alternative or otherwise.  See generally, id.   
 As a matter of fact, the term “POSD” or “Pride of San Diego” appears only once in BAE’s volume A technical proposal:  as a graphical entry in BAE’s pier and dry dock graphical representation.  Id.  at 9.  In that representation, however, POSD is shown as 
occupied by proposed work on another ship, the USS [DELETED] , during the period of 
performance for the USS Russell.  Id.  As noted above, that same graphical 
representation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay occupying the POCA dry dock during that same period.  Id.  at 9.  In sum, for the applicable period, 
BAE’s graphical representation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock and the USS [DELETED] at the POSD dock.  Id.   Moreover, just as 
no specific explanation was offered for the graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock, no additional explanation was provided with respect to the graphical representation showing that P OSD was occupied 
by work on another  outstanding proposal.  In this regard, the “Resource Conflicts” 
portion of BAE’s proposal simply acknowledged that BAE “currently has outstanding proposals,” including for work on the USS Green Bay and the USS [DELETED] , but did 
not mention POSD or any other specific de- conflicting plan, other than a general 
promise to “take[] reasonable and responsible steps to ensure the resources will be available to perform awarded work.”  Id. at 10.   
 On this record, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that BAE’s proposal “did not provide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources 
issue other than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking DDG and LCS class  ships.”  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  6.  As noted, the solicitation advised that 
“[p]iers and dry docks must not be committed to multiple ships during the same time  Page 10 B-423271  period without explanation” and that the agency would assess the offeror’s “capability to 
provide the required physical resources” with an “emphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated physical resource conflicts.”  RFP at  184, 199.  Here, 
BAE’s proposal provided no specific explanation or plan to address the potential conflict arising from the apparent commitment of multiple ships at the POCA dry dock.  Accordingly, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the POCA dock was unavailable.  Moreover, because BAE never expressly proposed the POSD dock to 
resolve conflicts at the POCA dock, other than a graphical representation showing the POSD dock occupied by another outstanding project, we find that the agency reasonably did not  consider the POSD dock as BAE’s proposed deconflicting strategy.  
 We therefore find no basis to object to the agency’s conclusion that BAE’s proposed private dry dock was “utilized” and did not offer sufficient capacity to perform the requirement for the USS Russell.  See AR, Tab  7, SSDD at  1.  Based on this 
conclusion, the agency reasonably decided to proceed with the consideration of volume B proposals to perform at a government dock without giving preferential 
treatment to BAE’s volume A proposal.    Evaluation of Volume B Proposals  
 BAE also contends that, even if the agency was justified in considering volume B proposals for award, the agency unreasonably and unequally evaluated those proposals under the manpower subfactor (of the manpower and small business participation factor).  S pecifically, the protester alleges that the agency unreasonably ignored 
information in BAE’s proposal in assessing a significant weakness for a significant 
shortfall in the firm’s manpower forecast.  Protest at  33-48; Comments at  21-41.  The 
protester also argues that the agency erroneously failed to consider a manpower 
shortfall arising from CMSD’s subcontract work on aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at 48-53; Comments at  41-49.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to 
object to the agenc y’s evaluation.  
  Evaluation of BAE’s Manpower Proposal  
 The protester challenges the Navy’s assessment of a significant weakness in BAE’s  
manpower proposal, asserting that the agency unreasonably ignored relevant information in BAE’s proposal.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency’s manpower calculations improperly excluded BAE’s proposed manpower from the firm’s projects in [DELETED] and [DELETED] , resulting in a projected shortfall of 
[DELETED]  FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Protest at  33-48; Comments 
at 21-41.  The protester argues t hat the agency similarly ignored BAE’s proposed use of 
affiliate resources and other mitigating measures that would have alleviated any concerns about a projected manpower shortage.  Id.  The agency responds that its 
evaluation properly excluded information about BAE’s affiliated entities and reasonably assessed a significant weakness for an unmitigated and significant shortfall in BAE’s manpower proposal.  COS/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6.   
  Page 11 B-423271  The record shows that, using the data in BAE’s manpower performance data sheet, the 
agency calculated BAE’s projected maximum workload scenario to require at least [DELETED]  FTEs, while also calculating BAE’s available “Current Yard- Wide
4 FTE” as 
[DELETED] FTEs.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  22-23.  Based on these calculations, the 
agency found that BAE’s current yard- wide workforce would result in a manpower 
shortfall of [DELETED] FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Id.  at 23.  
Assessing a significant weakness for this projected manpower shortfall, the agency concluded that BAE’s “in[ -]progress project performance and current yard[ -]wide FTE 
levels indicate a high risk of competition for resources that significantly incr eases the 
likelihood the  offeror will not have the manpower resources to perform as planned.”  Id.    
 The protester argues that the agency’s calculations unreasonably excluded the enterprise workforce data for its affiliate entities identified in BAE’s data sheet as two projects:  “Project 20 representing the ongoing and projected repair work at BAE 
System s’ [DELETED] shipyard, and Project  23 representing ongoing and projected 
repair work at BAE Systems’ [DELETED] facility.”  Comments at 23.  The protester 
contends that the agency was required to consider this information because the 
solicitation did not li mit the data sheet information that could be submitted to projects 
located at the local shipyard.   
 The agency responds that it properly did not consider data about the protester’s affiliate 
entities in the manpower calculation.  In this regard, the agency contends that the 
solicitation clearly sought data about “all work performed by the Offeror within the 
shipyard and at the local Naval Station.”  COS/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6; 
see RFP at  184-185.  The agency also argues that the protester’s affiliate entities, in 
[DELETED] and [DELETED] , were not the “Offeror” for BAE’s proposal, and the 
solicitation required information about all projects “for which the Offeror  is the prime or a 
major subcontractor” at the “ Offeror’s ” shipyard.  Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6.   
 
Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation’s actual requirements, we will first examine 
the plain language of the solicitation.  DAI Global, LLC , B-416992, Jan.  17, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 25 at  4.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of 
solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole 
and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore 
valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole 
and in a reasonable manner .  Crew Training Int ’l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb.  7, 2017, 
2017 CPD ¶ 53 at  4.  A proposed interpretation of solicitation language would be 
 
4 Although the solicitation does not define the term “Yard -Wide,” the agency contends 
that the term was intended to limit the offeror’s FTE data to those “within the [offeror’s] shipyard and at the local Naval Station, if the Offeror’s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.”  Supp. COS/MOL at  5-6.  The protester disputes the agency’s 
interpretation, arguing that the term could mean within any of the offeror’s shipyards.  Protester’s Supp.  Comments at  18-19.  As further discussed below, we need not 
address this issue in this decision.   Page 12 B-423271  unreasonable insofar as it would render other solicitation language superfluous.  See 
Anders Constr ., Inc., B-414261, Apr.  11, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 121 at  3-4. 
 Here, the protester’s argument that the solicitation did not prohibit manpower data from outside the local San Diego shipyard wholly disregards the detailed solicitation instructions to complete the data sheet and manpower charts with specific, project -based data.  As noted, the solicitation provided a detailed definition of 
“projects” --as “Navy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which 
the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor” --and instructed offerors to provide 
specific, detailed information about each project in the format provided in solicitation attachment  S-4.  RFP at  184-185.  The solicitation further informed offerors that the 
agency would use this detailed, project -specific  data to calculate the offeror’s projected 
workload needs and the manpower available for meeting those needs, calculated as the offeror’s historical and current yard- wide FTEs.  Id. at 200.   
 The specific entries that the protester alleges should have been included in the calculations did not satisfy this definition of “projects” because they:  (1) did not present data for discrete projects; and (2) represented the combined workforce data for t wo of 
the protester’s affiliate entities, rather than projects “for which the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor.”
5  RFP at 184; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, Appendix B, BAE’s 
Manpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE’s Manpower and Small 
Business Participation Proposal at  6-7.  More specifically, despite being included in the 
manpower data sheet as “Project  20” and “Project  23,” respectively, the entries for “BAE 
Systems [DELETED] Ship Repair” and “BAE Systems [DELETED] Ship Repair” 
provided summarized data for BAE’s affiliate entities,  “depict [ing] recent actual 
performance and forecasted manhour requirements ,” reflecting the purported resources 
of those affiliate entities  rather than discrete projects.  See AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, 
Appendix B, BAE’s Manpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE’s 
Manpower and Small Business Participation Proposal at  10.  Moreover, as the agency 
notes, the offeror in the protester’s proposal is BAE  Systems San Diego Ship Repair, 
Inc., of San Diego, California, not BAE’s affiliate entities in [DELETED] and [DELETED] .  
Supp. COS/MOL at 5-6.  On this record, we find no basis to conclude that the agency 
unreasonably excluded the data about BAE’s affiliate entities from its evaluation of BAE’s manpower.
 6    
 
5 In contrast, the record shows that BAE followed the solicitation instructions when it 
identified and provided required data for the [DELETED] discrete shipyard projects in its 
manpower data sheet, e.g.,  the USS Russell as project [DELETED] , the USS Green 
Bay as project  [DELETED] , and the USS [DELETED]  as project  [DELETED] .   
6 Because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not elaborate on why the 
agency excluded the disputed data in its calculations, BAE  contends that the agency ’s 
post-protest explanations  offer an impermissible post-hoc interpretation of the 
solicitation that should be afforded little weight.  In our view,  however,  the agency ’s 
response provides a credible and consistent rationale for the Navy’s contemporaneous 
decision to disregard the manpower data for BAE’s affiliate entities .  Wackenhut Servs., 
(continued...)   Page 13 B-423271   
We also find no basis to question the SSEB’s conclusion that BAE’s manpower narrative “did not provide a sufficient explanation for overcoming the manning shortfall calculated by Navy’s Projected Workload via the provided BAE attachment S -4.”  AR, 
Tab 4, SSEB Report  at 24.  While the protester argues that the mitigation approaches 
detailed in its manpower narrative --i.e., its hiring initiative, enterprise resource sharing, 
and subcontracting approach--should have alleviated any concern about BAE’s manpower shortfall, Protest at  40-48, Comments at  29-41, the protester’s arguments in 
this regard amount to nothing more than disagreement with the agency’s reasonable evaluation.    The record shows that the agency specifically considered each mitigation approach proposed in BAE’s manpower narrative to determine whether the approach sufficiently mitigated the significant weakness of BAE’s projected manpower shortage.  AR, Tab 4, 
SSEB Report  at 24.  For example, the SSEB considered BAE’s “attempt[] to mitigate 
hiring actions by hiring trades starting in March 2024” and found that BAE’s narrative did “not state the progress with this hiring initiative to the date of their USS RUSSELL proposal r eceipt.”  Id.  The agency further explains that, while BAE’s narrative stated 
that it “initiated a hiring plan” by hiring “ [DELETED] BAE Systems and temporary labor 
personnel since 03/01/2024” and planned to hire an “additional [DELETED] trade 
personnel” by December 2024, it did not explain whether its manpower charts included those [DELETED] additional FTEs or provide any detail about its plan to hire 
[DELETED] more FTEs in just three months (from September 16 to December 2024).  
Supp. COS/MOL at 6 n.7; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, BAE’s Manpower and Small 
Business Participation Proposal at  9.  While the protester now presents additional 
information by providing interim recruitment dates and even a new chart purportedly “based directly on the data provided in the hiring approach discussi on” in BAE’s 
proposal, these additional details were not included in the proposal that the agency evaluated.  Comments at  35; see generally, AR, Tab  2, Vol. 2B, BAE’s Manpower and 
Small Business Participation Proposal.    Therefore, on this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s reasoned conclusion that BAE’s manpower narrative did not provide sufficient information to overcome the risk presented by the assessed manpower shortage of [DELETED] 
FTEs.
7  As noted above, the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency’s

generally accord greater weight to contemporaneous evidence, we will consider post-protest explanations that provide a rationale for contemporaneous conclusions, so 
long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record. ”).  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the agency ’s explanation constitutes  
an impermissible post-hoc rationalization . 
7 Although the protester also argues that various mitigating approaches in its manpower 
narrative should have at least improved the risk presented from a significant weakness

insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  See Vertex Aerospace, 
LLC, supra.  
 
 Evaluation of CMSD’s Manpower Proposal  
 The protester also contends that the agency evaluated manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally by calculating manpower without considering CMSD’s subcontract work on various aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at  48-53; Comments 
at 41-49.  Specifically, the protester alleges that publicly available information shows 
that CMSD has undertaken a significant manpower commitment from certain aircraft carrier subcontract work which, if included in the manpower performance calculations, would have resulted in a significant, forecasted shortage in CMSD’s manpower.  Id.    
 For the purpose of the evaluation under the manpower subfactor, the solicitation required offerors to provide “specified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.”  RFP at  184.  The required workload 
data was to be provided for all projects “for which the Offeror is the prime or a major 
subcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy project).”  Id.  The record shows that the SSEB assigned a rating 
of good to CMSD’s manpower proposal based on two strengths assigned for calculations showing a manpower surplus of over [DELETED] FTEs under both the 
maximum and the minimum workload scenarios.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report  at 24. 
 The protester asserts, based on information it obtained from “public sources,” that 
CMSD improperly omitted data about its subcontract work on two aircraft carrier projects from its manpower data sheet and charts.  Protest at  48-53; Comments 
at 41-49; Supp. Comments at  13-16.  BAE contends that the agency unreasonably 
ignored this omission during its evaluation of CMSD’s manpower despite references to this work in CMSD’s proposal.  Id.  The protester argues that, had CMSD included these projects in its manpower data sheet and manpower charts, the calculations would show a projected manpower shortage rather than a surplus.  Id. 
 The agency responds that it reasonably did not consider the workforce data for CMSD’s aircraft carrier subcontract work when evaluating CMSD’s manpower proposal.  COS/MOL at 21; Supp. COS/MOL at  1-2.  In this regard, the agency notes that the 
solicitation did not require offerors to explain why work was excluded from the 
manpower data sheet and that the Navy had no reason to question CMSD’s decision on what information was included in its proposal.  Supp. COS/MOL at  2.  The agency also 
notes that CMSD’s proposal nevertheless did explain why it did not include the aircraft carrier subcontract work by explaining that it carries additional FTEs to support subcontracted work not required to be reported under this solicitation.  Id., citing AR, 
 
to a weakness, the protester’s disagreement with the agency in this regard also fails to establish that the agency’s judgment was unreasonable.   Page 15 B-423271  Tab 3b, Vol.  2B-7, CMSD’s Manpower Narrative at  3.  Based on our review of the 
record, we agree with the agency.  
 
As an initial matter, while the solicitation required offerors to provide data about projects for which they were “the prime or a major subcontractor” (defined as performing 30 percent or more of the work), it did not require offerors to provide any inform ation 
about subcontractor projects below that threshold.  RFP at  184.  Specifically, the 
protester appears to suggest that CMSD was required to provide detailed data about its aircraft carrier subcontract work and then allow the agency to confirm that CMSD  was 
performing less than 30 percent of the work, see Supp. Comments at  16, but the 
solicitation included no such requirement.  Rather, the solicitation relied on the offeror to provide the required information for projects that met the applicable solicitation definition, and advised that the manpower evaluation would be based on the information provided in the offeror’s proposal.
8  RFP at  184-186, 199- 201.  To the extent an offeror 
determined that a particular work effort did not meet the threshold criteria for projects required to be included in the proposal, nothing in the solicitation required the Navy to investigate beyond the four corners of the proposal  to question that determination.  
 In any event, the record shows that CMSD’s proposal informed the agency that its aircraft carrier subcontract work did not fall within the definition of projects required to be included in the proposal.  In addition to explaining that it “ carries additional organic 
FTEs to support other subcontracted work that is  less than the 30 [percent]  of a CNO  
availability required for reporting [in accordance with]  this solicitation ,” CMSD 
specifically referred to its aircraft carrier subcontract work as “ additional ” work that was 
not required to be “reported”  in its manpower proposal.  See AR, Tab  3b, Vol.  2B-7, 
CMSD’s Manpower Narrative at  1 (“In addition to supporting the [DELETED] 
[availabilities], CMSD is presently supporting the following availability . . .”); 2  (“CMSD’s 
still has additional  labor force available not accounted for in the scheduled FTEs 
currently supporting non- Prime [aircraft carrier] availabilities. . . . [fiscal year] 22 Q3 and 
Q4 FTEs continue to increase with a peak of [DELETED] FTEs in November 2022 for 
reported availabilities, plus an additional  [DELETED] FTE supporting [aircraft carrier] 
projects for a total of [DELETED] CMSD FTEs .”) (emphasis added).  On this record, we 
find that the agency reasonably did not consider CMSD’s additional aircraft carrier 
 
8 The protester also complains that the agency’s post -protest explanation in this regard 
offers various theories about CMSD’s aircraft carrier subcontract work without any contemporaneous evaluation documentation about this work, and thus constitutes an impermissible post-hoc rationalization.  See Supp. Comments at  1-16.  As our Office 
has noted, we do not expect an agency ’s evaluation report to “prove a negative. ”  See 
BillSmart Solutions, LLC, B -413272.4, B -413272.5, Oct.  23, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 325 
at 14 n.19.   Thus, there was no requirement for the agency  to document why it did not 
consider information that the solicitation did not require to be included in an offeror’s proposal, and which the awardee did not, in fact, include.   Page 16 B-423271  project manpower data, which fell outside the definition of projects required to be 
included in the offerors’ manpower charts and data sheets.9   
 We similarly find that the protester’s allegation that the Navy evaluated manpower disparately is unsupported by this record.  In this regard, the agency did not consider 
this non- major subcontractor work in its manpower evaluation just as the agency 
declined to include BAE’s affiliate manpower data (which, as discussed above, also 
didn’t satisfy the solicitation requirements) in the calculations.  Accordingly, we find no 
basis to sustain the protest.

9 In any case, the intervenor confirms that the aircraft carrier projects were not included 
in its proposal because CMSD was not a “major subcontractor” as defined by the solicitation, performing substantially less than 30 percent of the work for those proj ects.

improper because it was based on an unreasonable and unequal evaluation.  Protest at 57-59.  This allegation is based on the protester’s challenges to the agency’s

 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-422624.10   BACKGROUND  
 
GSA issued the TOR on January 30, 2024, under the procedures of Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to holders of GSA ’s One Acquisition Solution for 
Integrated Services (OASIS) small business indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) 
contract pool 5B .1  Agency Report (AR), Tab 2, TOR amend. 0009 (hereinafter TOR) 
at 3; Contracting Officer's Statement (COS) at 1.  The solicitation contemplated the 
issuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) 
for the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and 
the contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  
TOR at 4.   
 The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to 
include  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and 
responsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, 
production, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 5.  The solicitation provided for the 
evaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis), technical capability, and cost/price.  Id.  at 61.  Award  was to be made 
on a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of 
importance.  Id. at 60.   The technical capability factor included the following two 
elements:  task order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.
2  Id. at 62 -64.  As relevant here, the TOR included FAR provision 
52.222- 46.  Id. at 44 . 
 After the initial evaluation of proposals, in May 2024, GSA selected Credence for award.  
COS at 3.  Thereafter, another unsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response, 
the agency notified our Office of its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate 
proposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote Rsch. , Inc., B-422624, June 20, 
2024 (unpublished).  As a result, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Id. 
 Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of Quantech and Credence:
3 
 
 
 
1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-
award IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a 
request for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead 
of quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do 
the same.  
2 The TOR explained that these two elements “will not be individually rated and are not 
subfactors,” but rather, “[t]hey are areas of emphasis for offerors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating.”  TOR at 61.  
3 The TOR provided that technical capability would be evaluated as exceptional, good, 
acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 64- 66.  Page 3    B-422624.10    QUANTECH  CREDENCE

The contracting officer noted that both offerors received multiple strengths under the technical capability factor.  Id.  at 56.  For the task order management plan element, the 
contracting officer noted that Quantech received a significant weakness; the agency did 
not find any weaknesses in Credence’s technical approach.  Id.   Given the noted 
strengths and lower evaluated cost of Credence’s proposal, the agency found that 
Credence’s proposal represented the best value and issued the task order to that firm for the total amount of $221,811,016.  Id.  at 55- 56, 58.  
 The agency notified Quantech on October 17, 2024, that its proposal had not been 
selected for award.  COS at 4.  Thereafter, Quantech and two other unsuccessful 
offerors filed protests at GAO.
5  Quantech’s protest challenged the agency’s evaluation 
of proposals, including the evaluation of Credence’s proposed professional employee compensation plan.  After development of the record, t he GAO attorney assigned to the 
protest conducted outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution (ADR) with the parties, explaining that the record did not reflect that GSA had properly evaluated Credence’s proposed professional compensation plan as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Thereafter, GSA opted to take corrective action to reevaluate cost 
proposals, including professional compensation plans,  and either reaffirm the award to 
Credence or make a new best -value determination.   Accordingly, GAO dismissed the 
protest as academic.  Quantech Servs., Inc. , B-422624. 3, B-422624.7, Feb. 18, 2025

protest with our Office.7  Id. 
 
DISCUSSION  Quantech argues that  GSA unreasonably evaluat ed the awardee’s professional 
compensation under FAR  provision 52.222- 46.  Comments at 1 .  According to 
Quantech, GSA “has not reasonably evaluated either element required by the professional compensation clause” --i.e., whether the total compensation is lower than 
incumbent compensation such that it risks continuity of support , or the realism of the 
total compensation.
8  Id.  For the reasons discussed below, we find the protester’s 
arguments provide no basis to sustain the protest.9   
  Comparison to Incumbent Compensation  
 The protester contends that the agency’s methodology for evaluating proposed total compensation plans was flawed because the agency failed to compare the proposed compensation plans with the incumbent compensation levels as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  
 As relevant here, the TOR required proposals to include a professional employee compensation plan, as prescribed in FAR provision 52.222- 46.  TOR at 4 4.  The 
purpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 is to evaluate whether offerors will obtain and keep 
the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance, and to evaluate whether vendors understand the nature of the work to be performed.   Obsidian 
Sols. Grp., LLC , B-416343, B -416343.3, Aug. 8, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 274 at 7.  The 
provision requi res that the agency evaluate an offeror’s proposed professional  
compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) by considering its impact on recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation.  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a).   In addition, our Office has explained that if an agency resolicits 
a requirement in a follow -on procurement, FAR provision 52.222- 46(b) requires the 
agency to compare the awardee’s proposed professional compensation to the

8 Quantech also initially challenged the availability of one of the awardee’s key 
personnel, but thereafter withdrew this argument.  Comments at 2 , n.1 (“Quantech 
withdraws its argument that the award was improper because the [a]gency knew Credence proposed an unavailable key person.”).  
9 Although we do not address all of the protester’s arguments in this decision, we have 
considered them all and find that none provides a basis upon which to sustain the 
protest.   Page 5    B-422624.10   incumbent contractor’s.10 SURVICE Eng’g Co., LLC, B -414519, July 5, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 237 at 5- 6.   
 
As relevant here, t he instant requirement is the consolidation of five  incumbent task 
orders.   Supp. Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 2.  In conducting its evaluation,  the 
agency concluded that the instant requirement is a new requirement, not a follow -on 
requirement.  COS at 8; AR, Tab  11, Contracting Officer (CO ) Memo for Record at  2.  In 
making this determination, the contracting officer explained that although “ this 
requirement is a summation of multiple prior contracts (both ongoing and expired) that have been modified, combined and restructured, ” this requirement  is “not a direct follow -
on award.”  AR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at  2.  The contracting officer found that , 
“[a]s a result,  [while]  this does create an ability for possible incumbents working on 
portions of the various existing contracts to be utilized in this effort, ” it “does not allow 
for an adequate direct side by side comparison of proposed and past rates for incumbent personnel. ”  Id.  According to the agency, “because this is not a recompete 
effort with true and complete incumbent compensation data available for use in the 52.222- 46 analysis, . . . the provision’s requirements for recompete procurements (and 
the GAO’s stated two -part analysis for such situations) are not applicable.”  MOL at 10.    
 Quantech argues that the agency unreasonably conclu ded that it had “no obligation to 
compare proposed compensation to incumbent compensation data.”  Comments  at 8. 
The protester argues that the a gency ’s decision not to compare proposed and 
incumbent compensation do not follow from the facts it has identified and that it is unclear why the agency could not perform a side- by-side comparison with the 
incumbent information.   Id. at 9.  In the protester’s view, because the agency has 
access to compensation data from the prior contracts, the agency is required by the FAR to compare that information to the proposed compensation data even though the agency concluded that this was not a follow -on requirement .  Supp. Comments at 3.  In 
this regard, the protester maintains that “FAR 52.222- 46 is not concerned with the label

requirement’),” but rather, “whether the effort anticipates using professional employees to perform ‘essentially the same professional work’ they performed under a prior service contract.”  Id. 
 The agency asserts it  reasonably determined that this was a new acquisition, not a

with any incumbent compensation data.   Id. at 11. 
 
Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s determination that this is a new requirement and therefore the agency was not required to consider incumbent compensation data as part of its evaluation.   As referenced 
above, FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) provides that “[r]ecompetition of service contracts 
may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished” and that “[t]his lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of profess ional services needed for adequate contract performance.”  The FAR further 
provides that “proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated” and cautions that “lowered compensation for  essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound 
management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.”  FAR provision 52.222- 46(b).   As noted above, our Office has found that if an agency resolicits a 
requirement in a follow -on procurement, FAR provision 52.222- 46(b) requires the 
agency to compare the awardee’s proposed professional compensation to the incumbent contractor’s.   SURVICE Eng’g Co., LLC, supra .   
 Despite the protester’s arguments to the contrary, the aspect of FAR provision 52.222- 46 that requires comparison to incumbent compensation is applicable to only a 
“recompetition” for “essentially the same professional work.”  FAR provision 
52.222- 46(a); (b).  Here, the agency found that the instant requirement was not a 
recompetition for essentially the same work, but rather, a mixture of portions of five prior efforts that have been modified, combined, and restructured with new requirements.  
AR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at 2; COS at 8.    
 As the agency further explains in response to the protest, its acquisition plan lists five predecessor contracts --some of which were awarded by GSA and others by the SSC --
that are blended into this requirement along with the new requirements.  Supp. MOL at 2 (quoting Supp. MOL, exh. 1, Acquisition Plan at 6) (“SSC has gone through several 
major reorganizations and as a result this is deemed to be a new requirement and not the combining of task orders and/or efforts.”); id.  at 6-7(noting that the “previous cited 
contracts . . . make up [only] a small subset of the totality of the work to be performed on the new requirement” as the “scope of work of [the new] requirement is expanded to include additional command staff support and services.”).  The agency explains that 
“[e]conomies of scale and cost -savings are logically anticipated to accrue to the 
awardee of this much larger and higher dollar value task order ” that are “likely to impact 
the amount and extent of compensation the awar dee provides its  employees as 
contrasted to individual smaller predecessor efforts subsumed into this task order .”  
Supp. MOL at 2.   While Quantech disagrees with the agency, the protester has not 
demonstrated that the agency’s assessment was unreasonable.  This protest g round is 
denied.  
  Page 7    B-422624.10    Realism Evaluation  
 
Quantech further  argues that the agency failed to properly assess the realism of 
Credence’s total proposed professional compensation.  Comments at 6 .  The protester 
also asserts that the agency’s evaluation was insufficient to properly assess the realism of Credence’s total compensation plan ( i.e., salaries and fringe benefits) because it 
included consideration of the “technical analyses” performed by the agency.  Id. at 1.   
 The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated the awardee’ s total compensation 
plan in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46.  In this regard, the agency contends 
that it conducted a thorough analysis of the awardee’s total compensation plan--including labor rates and fringe benefits --and reasonably found it to be realistic.  The 
agency maintains that it reasonably used recognized, acceptable techniques for evaluating the realism of the awardee’s professional compensation under the circumstances of thi s acquisition.  Supp. MOL at 5.   
 Provision 52.222- 46 of the FAR calls for a cost evaluation of each offeror’s 
compensation plan that considers the realism of the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruitment and retention.  Target Media Mid Atlantic, Inc., B -412468.8, Jun.  27, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 208 at 5.   In conducting such a 
cost realism analysis, an agency is not required to conduct an in- depth cost analysis, or 
to verify each and every item in assessing cost realism; rather, the evaluation requires the exercise of informed judgment by the contracting agency.  Id.  Additionally, an 
agency ’s cost realism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the 
methodology employed must be reasonable and realistic in view of other cost 
information reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.  CSI, 
Inc.; Visual Awareness Techs. &  Consulting, Inc. , B-407332.5 et al. , Jan. 12, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 35 at 6.  Our review of an agency ’s cost realism evaluation is limited to 
determining whether the cost analysis is reasonably based and not arbitrary.  Jacobs

 Here, the record reflects that the agency conducted an evaluation that was reasonable, consistent with the solicitation, and in accordance with the requirements of FAR provision 52.222- 46.   
 First, the cost/price evaluators compared the offerors’ proposed direct labor rates, 
broken down by standard occupational classification and labor skill level using Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) salary information.   See AR,  Tab 11, CO Memo for Record  
at 2; COS at 8 .  For this comparison, each skill level  was compared to the 
commensurate BLS wage percentiles.   Id.  The evaluators then performed an impact 
analysis on the direct labor rates that fell significantly (more than 10 percent) below the BLS wage e stimates and adjusted the questioned direct labor rates upwards to the 
equivalent BLS rates in order to estimate the total impact.  AR, Tab 10, ADM at 47-49; 
Supp. MOL at 6.    
  Page 8    B-422624.10   Next, with regard to proposed fringe benefits, the agency analyzed the reasonableness 
and realism of the offerors’ proposed fringe rates by conducting a side- by-side 
comparison of the rates provided by each offeror.11  COS at 11 -12; AR, Tab 11, 
CO Memo for Record at 6 (noting that Credence’s and Quantech’s proposed fringe 
rates are part of their Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA)  approved provisional 
billing rates and that both offerors’ proposals applied their approved fringe rates).   For 
example, this comparison showed that Quantech and Credence proposed “ [DELETED] ” 
([DELETED]  percent for Quantech and [DELETED]  percent for Credence).  AR, Tab 11, 
CO Memo for Record at 5-6.   
 
In addition, the contracting officer , who also served as the source selection authority for 
the procurement,  expressly noted her consideration of Credence’s fringe benefits, 
including flexible paid time off , [DELETED]  of vacation and [DELETED]  holidays, 401(k) 
individual retirement account savings plan with e mployer matching up to [DELETED] , as 
well as company  shared premiums for healthcare and disability insurance for 
employees.  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for Record at 6 .  The contracting officer also noted 
that the technical evaluation team assigned  Credence a strength for its hiring and 
retention policies , which she found supports the a gency determination that Credence 
will be able to fulfill the contract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for 
successful contract performance.   AR, Tab 10, A DM at 26.  Based on this analysis, the 
agency concluded that Credence’s proposed compensation levels reflect a clear understanding of the work to be performed and the capability to obtain and keep 
suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives .  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for 
Record at 2. 
 
While the protester asserts that it was improper for the agency to consider the findings 
from the  technical evaluation in assessing the awardee’s proposed compensation plan, 
we find nothing unreasonable about the contracting officer’s consider ation of  the 
strength assessed for Credence’s hiring and retention policies, which the contracting 
officer found supports the agency ’s determination that Credence will be able to fulfill the 
contract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for successful contract performance.   We have previously found an agency’s consideration of  similar findings 
reasonable.  See e.g. , Apptis Inc. , B-403249, B-403249.3, Sept. 30, 2010, 2010 CPD 
¶ 237 at 10-11 (finding the agency’s evaluation of realism under FAR provision 
52.222- 46 reasonably relied in part on findings that the contractor’s proposal merited a 
strength under the recruitment and retention subfactor based on proposed excellent 
training benefits, tuition reimbursement for  degree or certification programs , and a 
retention goal with an actual average well above the industry standard) .   
 Furthermore, to the extent the protester alleges that the agency’s realism evaluation 
was insufficient  because it did not include additional analyses , we note that the 
protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation in this regard, without more, does

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging the agency ’s evaluation of the awardee’s  professional employee 
compensation plan is denied because the record demonstrates that the agency ’s 
evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation and the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation provision 52.222- 46. 
DECISION  
 Quantech Services, Inc. , a small business located in Lexington, Massachusetts , 
protests the issuance of a task order to Credence Management Solutions, LLC, a small business located in McLean, Virginia, under t ask order request for proposal (TOR) No. 
47QFPA24R0001, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service, on behalf of the United States Space Force, Space Systems 
Command (SSC), for command staff support services.   The protester challenges the 
agency ’s evaluation of the awardee’s  proposed professional employee compensation 
plan.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-422624.10   BACKGROUND  
 
GSA issued the TOR on January 30, 2024, under the procedures of Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to holders of GSA ’s One Acquisition Solution for 
Integrated Services (OASIS) small business indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) 
contract pool 5B .1  Agency Report (AR), Tab 2, TOR amend. 0009 (hereinafter TOR) 
at 3; Contracting Officer's Statement (COS) at 1.  The solicitation contemplated the 
issuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) 
for the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and 
the contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  
TOR at 4.   
 The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to 
include  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and 
responsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, 
production, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 5.  The solicitation provided for the 
evaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis), technical capability, and cost/price.  Id.  at 61.  Award  was to be made 
on a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of 
importance.  Id. at 60.   The technical capability factor included the following two 
elements:  task order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.
2  Id. at 62 -64.  As relevant here, the TOR included FAR provision 
52.222- 46.  Id. at 44 . 
 After the initial evaluation of proposals, in May 2024, GSA selected Credence for award.  
COS at 3.  Thereafter, another unsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response, 
the agency notified our Office of its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate 
proposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote Rsch. , Inc., B-422624, June 20, 
2024 (unpublished).  As a result, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Id. 
 Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of Quantech and Credence:
3 
 
 
 
1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-
award IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a 
request for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead 
of quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do 
the same.  
2 The TOR explained that these two elements “will not be individually rated and are not 
subfactors,” but rather, “[t]hey are areas of emphasis for offerors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating.”  TOR at 61.  
3 The TOR provided that technical capability would be evaluated as exceptional, good, 
acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 64- 66.  Page 3    B-422624.10    QUANTECH  CREDENCE  
Technical Capability  Acceptable  Good  
Total Evaluated Cost/Price  $282,219,685  $221,811,016  
 
AR, Tab 10, Award Decision Memorandum (ADM) at 54.4 
 
The contracting officer noted that both offerors received multiple strengths under the technical capability factor.  Id.  at 56.  For the task order management plan element, the 
contracting officer noted that Quantech received a significant weakness; the agency did 
not find any weaknesses in Credence’s technical approach.  Id.   Given the noted 
strengths and lower evaluated cost of Credence’s proposal, the agency found that 
Credence’s proposal represented the best value and issued the task order to that firm for the total amount of $221,811,016.  Id.  at 55- 56, 58.  
 The agency notified Quantech on October 17, 2024, that its proposal had not been 
selected for award.  COS at 4.  Thereafter, Quantech and two other unsuccessful 
offerors filed protests at GAO.
5  Quantech’s protest challenged the agency’s evaluation 
of proposals, including the evaluation of Credence’s proposed professional employee compensation plan.  After development of the record, t he GAO attorney assigned to the 
protest conducted outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution (ADR) with the parties, explaining that the record did not reflect that GSA had properly evaluated Credence’s proposed professional compensation plan as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Thereafter, GSA opted to take corrective action to reevaluate cost 
proposals, including professional compensation plans,  and either reaffirm the award to 
Credence or make a new best -value determination.   Accordingly, GAO dismissed the 
protest as academic.  Quantech Servs., Inc. , B-422624. 3, B-422624.7, Feb. 18, 2025 
(unpublished decision ). 
 As relevant here, the agency’s corrective action involved conducting an evaluation of Credence’s proposed professional compensation plan.
6  COS at 5 .  After the 
reevaluation, the contracting officer confirmed the award to Credence.  Id . On 
February  27, 2025, the agency notified Quantech that it had not been selected for

protest with our Office.7  Id. 
 
DISCUSSION  Quantech argues that  GSA unreasonably evaluat ed the awardee’s professional 
compensation under FAR  provision 52.222- 46.  Comments at 1 .  According to 
Quantech, GSA “has not reasonably evaluated either element required by the professional compensation clause” --i.e., whether the total compensation is lower than 
incumbent compensation such that it risks continuity of support , or the realism of the 
total compensation.
8  Id.  For the reasons discussed below, we find the protester’s 
arguments provide no basis to sustain the protest.9   
  Comparison to Incumbent Compensation  
 The protester contends that the agency’s methodology for evaluating proposed total compensation plans was flawed because the agency failed to compare the proposed compensation plans with the incumbent compensation levels as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  
 As relevant here, the TOR required proposals to include a professional employee compensation plan, as prescribed in FAR provision 52.222- 46.  TOR at 4 4.  The 
purpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 is to evaluate whether offerors will obtain and keep 
the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance, and to evaluate whether vendors understand the nature of the work to be performed.   Obsidian 
Sols. Grp., LLC , B-416343, B -416343.3, Aug. 8, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 274 at 7.  The 
provision requi res that the agency evaluate an offeror’s proposed professional  
compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) by considering its impact on recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation.  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a).   In addition, our Office has explained that if an agency resolicits 
a requirement in a follow -on procurement, FAR provision 52.222- 46(b) requires the 
agency to compare the awardee’s proposed professional compensation to the

jurisdiction.  41 U.S.C. § 4106(f); Analytic Strategies LLC; Gemini Indus., Inc. ,

8 Quantech also initially challenged the availability of one of the awardee’s key 
personnel, but thereafter withdrew this argument.  Comments at 2 , n.1 (“Quantech 
withdraws its argument that the award was improper because the [a]gency knew Credence proposed an unavailable key person.”).  
9 Although we do not address all of the protester’s arguments in this decision, we have 
considered them all and find that none provides a basis upon which to sustain the 
protest.   Page 5    B-422624.10   incumbent contractor’s.10 SURVICE Eng’g Co., LLC, B -414519, July 5, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 237 at 5- 6.   
 
As relevant here, t he instant requirement is the consolidation of five  incumbent task 
orders.   Supp. Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 2.  In conducting its evaluation,  the 
agency concluded that the instant requirement is a new requirement, not a follow -on 
requirement.  COS at 8; AR, Tab  11, Contracting Officer (CO ) Memo for Record at  2.  In 
making this determination, the contracting officer explained that although “ this 
requirement is a summation of multiple prior contracts (both ongoing and expired) that have been modified, combined and restructured, ” this requirement  is “not a direct follow -
on award.”  AR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at  2.  The contracting officer found that , 
“[a]s a result,  [while]  this does create an ability for possible incumbents working on 
portions of the various existing contracts to be utilized in this effort, ” it “does not allow 
for an adequate direct side by side comparison of proposed and past rates for incumbent personnel. ”  Id.  According to the agency, “because this is not a recompete 
effort with true and complete incumbent compensation data available for use in the 52.222- 46 analysis, . . . the provision’s requirements for recompete procurements (and 
the GAO’s stated two -part analysis for such situations) are not applicable.”  MOL at 10.    
 Quantech argues that the agency unreasonably conclu ded that it had “no obligation to 
compare proposed compensation to incumbent compensation data.”  Comments  at 8. 
The protester argues that the a gency ’s decision not to compare proposed and 
incumbent compensation do not follow from the facts it has identified and that it is unclear why the agency could not perform a side- by-side comparison with the 
incumbent information.   Id. at 9.  In the protester’s view, because the agency has 
access to compensation data from the prior contracts, the agency is required by the FAR to compare that information to the proposed compensation data even though the agency concluded that this was not a follow -on requirement .  Supp. Comments at 3.  In 
this regard, the protester maintains that “FAR 52.222- 46 is not concerned with the label 
assigned by the agency to the procurement ( e.g., ‘recompete,’ ‘follow -on,’ or ‘new 
requirement’),” but rather, “whether the effort anticipates using professional employees to perform ‘essentially the same professional work’ they performed under a prior service contract.”  Id. 
 The agency asserts it  reasonably determined that this was a new acquisition, not a 
follow- on or recompetition, and therefore, found that incumbent compensation data for 
limited aspects of the new acquisition would not be relevant for purposes of FAR 52.222- 46.  MOL at 9 .  Based on this determination, the agency argues that it s 
 
10 Where, however, “an agency does not have access to incumbent compensation 
information, it may use other reasonable means of analyzing proposed total compensation plans.”  Octo Consulting Grp., Inc. , B-420988, B -420988.2, Nov. 30, 
2022, 2023 CPD ¶ 2 at 10 n.4.  In this context, we found it reasonable for an agency to use “compensation levels developed based on market information,” id. , or “the average 
[general schedule] equivalent rates and average offeror rates.”  Obsidian Sols. Grp., LLC, supra at 9.  Page 6    B-422624.10   evaluation properly did not compare the offerors’ proposed professional compensation 
with any incumbent compensation data.   Id. at 11. 
 
Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s determination that this is a new requirement and therefore the agency was not required to consider incumbent compensation data as part of its evaluation.   As referenced 
above, FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) provides that “[r]ecompetition of service contracts 
may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished” and that “[t]his lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of profess ional services needed for adequate contract performance.”  The FAR further 
provides that “proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated” and cautions that “lowered compensation for  essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound 
management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.”  FAR provision 52.222- 46(b).   As noted above, our Office has found that if an agency resolicits a 
requirement in a follow -on procurement, FAR provision 52.222- 46(b) requires the 
agency to compare the awardee’s proposed professional compensation to the incumbent contractor’s.   SURVICE Eng’g Co., LLC, supra .   
 Despite the protester’s arguments to the contrary, the aspect of FAR provision 52.222- 46 that requires comparison to incumbent compensation is applicable to only a 
“recompetition” for “essentially the same professional work.”  FAR provision 
52.222- 46(a); (b).  Here, the agency found that the instant requirement was not a 
recompetition for essentially the same work, but rather, a mixture of portions of five prior efforts that have been modified, combined, and restructured with new requirements.  
AR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at 2; COS at 8.    
 As the agency further explains in response to the protest, its acquisition plan lists five predecessor contracts --some of which were awarded by GSA and others by the SSC --
that are blended into this requirement along with the new requirements.  Supp. MOL at 2 (quoting Supp. MOL, exh. 1, Acquisition Plan at 6) (“SSC has gone through several 
major reorganizations and as a result this is deemed to be a new requirement and not the combining of task orders and/or efforts.”); id.  at 6-7(noting that the “previous cited 
contracts . . . make up [only] a small subset of the totality of the work to be performed on the new requirement” as the “scope of work of [the new] requirement is expanded to include additional command staff support and services.”).  The agency explains that 
“[e]conomies of scale and cost -savings are logically anticipated to accrue to the 
awardee of this much larger and higher dollar value task order ” that are “likely to impact 
the amount and extent of compensation the awar dee provides its  employees as 
contrasted to individual smaller predecessor efforts subsumed into this task order .”  
Supp. MOL at 2.   While Quantech disagrees with the agency, the protester has not 
demonstrated that the agency’s assessment was unreasonable.  This protest g round is 
denied.  
  Page 7    B-422624.10    Realism Evaluation  
 
Quantech further  argues that the agency failed to properly assess the realism of 
Credence’s total proposed professional compensation.  Comments at 6 .  The protester 
also asserts that the agency’s evaluation was insufficient to properly assess the realism of Credence’s total compensation plan ( i.e., salaries and fringe benefits) because it 
included consideration of the “technical analyses” performed by the agency.  Id. at 1.   
 The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated the awardee’ s total compensation 
plan in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46.  In this regard, the agency contends 
that it conducted a thorough analysis of the awardee’s total compensation plan--including labor rates and fringe benefits --and reasonably found it to be realistic.  The 
agency maintains that it reasonably used recognized, acceptable techniques for evaluating the realism of the awardee’s professional compensation under the circumstances of thi s acquisition.  Supp. MOL at 5.   
 Provision 52.222- 46 of the FAR calls for a cost evaluation of each offeror’s 
compensation plan that considers the realism of the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruitment and retention.  Target Media Mid Atlantic, Inc., B -412468.8, Jun.  27, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 208 at 5.   In conducting such a 
cost realism analysis, an agency is not required to conduct an in- depth cost analysis, or 
to verify each and every item in assessing cost realism; rather, the evaluation requires the exercise of informed judgment by the contracting agency.  Id.  Additionally, an 
agency ’s cost realism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the 
methodology employed must be reasonable and realistic in view of other cost 
information reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.  CSI,

 Here, the record reflects that the agency conducted an evaluation that was reasonable, consistent with the solicitation, and in accordance with the requirements of FAR provision 52.222- 46.   
 First, the cost/price evaluators compared the offerors’ proposed direct labor rates, 
broken down by standard occupational classification and labor skill level using Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) salary information.   See AR,  Tab 11, CO Memo for Record  
at 2; COS at 8 .  For this comparison, each skill level  was compared to the 
commensurate BLS wage percentiles.   Id.  The evaluators then performed an impact 
analysis on the direct labor rates that fell significantly (more than 10 percent) below the BLS wage e stimates and adjusted the questioned direct labor rates upwards to the 
equivalent BLS rates in order to estimate the total impact.  AR, Tab 10, ADM at 47-49; 
Supp. MOL at 6.    
  Page 8    B-422624.10   Next, with regard to proposed fringe benefits, the agency analyzed the reasonableness 
and realism of the offerors’ proposed fringe rates by conducting a side- by-side 
comparison of the rates provided by each offeror.11  COS at 11 -12; AR, Tab 11, 
CO Memo for Record at 6 (noting that Credence’s and Quantech’s proposed fringe 
rates are part of their Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA)  approved provisional 
billing rates and that both offerors’ proposals applied their approved fringe rates).   For 
example, this comparison showed that Quantech and Credence proposed “ [DELETED] ” 
([DELETED]  percent for Quantech and [DELETED]  percent for Credence).  AR, Tab 11, 
CO Memo for Record at 5-6.   
 
In addition, the contracting officer , who also served as the source selection authority for 
the procurement,  expressly noted her consideration of Credence’s fringe benefits, 
including flexible paid time off , [DELETED]  of vacation and [DELETED]  holidays, 401(k) 
individual retirement account savings plan with e mployer matching up to [DELETED] , as 
well as company  shared premiums for healthcare and disability insurance for 
employees.  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for Record at 6 .  The contracting officer also noted 
that the technical evaluation team assigned  Credence a strength for its hiring and 
retention policies , which she found supports the a gency determination that Credence 
will be able to fulfill the contract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for 
successful contract performance.   AR, Tab 10, A DM at 26.  Based on this analysis, the 
agency concluded that Credence’s proposed compensation levels reflect a clear understanding of the work to be performed and the capability to obtain and keep 
suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives .  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for 
Record at 2. 
 
While the protester asserts that it was improper for the agency to consider the findings 
from the  technical evaluation in assessing the awardee’s proposed compensation plan, 
we find nothing unreasonable about the contracting officer’s consider ation of  the 
strength assessed for Credence’s hiring and retention policies, which the contracting 
officer found supports the agency ’s determination that Credence will be able to fulfill the 
contract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for successful contract performance.   We have previously found an agency’s consideration of  similar findings 
reasonable.  See e.g. , Apptis Inc. , B-403249, B-403249.3, Sept. 30, 2010, 2010 CPD 
¶ 237 at 10-11 (finding the agency’s evaluation of realism under FAR provision 
52.222- 46 reasonably relied in part on findings that the contractor’s proposal merited a 
strength under the recruitment and retention subfactor based on proposed excellent 
training benefits, tuition reimbursement for  degree or certification programs , and a 
retention goal with an actual average well above the industry standard) .   
 Furthermore, to the extent the protester alleges that the agency’s realism evaluation 
was insufficient  because it did not include additional analyses , we note that the 
protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation in this regard, without more, does

DECISION  
 OReady, LLC, a woman- owned small -business of Las Vegas, Nevada, protests the 
award of a contract to ULU Hi -Tech, Inc., a small business of Honolulu, Hawaii, under 
request for quotations (RFQ) No. 1305M324Q0286, issued by the Department of 
Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for  Linux system 
support services.  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably excluded OReady from the competition for failing to meet the solicitation’s technical requirements.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation as a small business set -aside on July 19, 2024, using 
the simplified acquisition procedures  for commercial  products and services  set forth in 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13 and subpart 12.6.  Agency Report (AR),  Page 2 B-422910.2  Tab 1, RFQ at 1,  3.1  The agency sought Linux system support services for the N ational 
Weather Service  (NWS) , including services to install, support, secure, and troubleshoot 
its Linux systems for the NWS  Pacific Region offices.  Id. at 1.  The RFQ contemplated 
the award of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials contract, for one base year and 
four 1-year options.  Id.  at 3-5, 79.  
 
The solicitation provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, 
considering the following evaluation factors:  technical capability, management 
approach, staffing plan, and price.  Id. at 81- 82.  The n on-price factors, when combined, 
were approximately equal in importance to price.  Id.  at 81.  The solicitation required 
vendors to submit quotations in two volumes:  a technical quotation and a price quotation.  Id.  at 51.  Further, the RFQ  warned vendors that only “quotes that address 
and meet all requirements set forth in this solicitation will be considered acceptable, ” 
and failure to provide required information may  result in the quotation being  “excluded 
from further evaluation and rejected without further notification to the [vendor].”   Id. 
at 53. 
 The agency received quotations from 16 vendors , including the protester.  Contracting 
Officer’s Statement (COS) at 5; AR, Tab 5, Feb. 12 Unsuccessful Offeror Notice at 1.  On August 30, 2024, NOAA made award to ULU High- Tech, Inc.  COS at 6.  That 
award decision resulted in a protest  to our Office  from Tatra Solutions, Inc. , an 
unsuccessful vendor.   Id.  In response to Tatra’s protest , the agency notified our Office 
that it would take corrective action by reev aluating the non- price factors of vendors ’ 
quotations and making a new source selection decision.  Tatra Sols., Inc. , B-422910, 
Oct. 10, 2024 (unpublished decision).  As a result  of the agency’s proposed corrective 
action, o ur Office dismissed the  protest as academic on October 10.  Id.   
 On February 26, 2025, t he agency notified all vendors, including O Ready, of the result 
of the reevaluation.  COS at 8 .  In the agency’s notice to OReady, NOAA advised the 
protester that its quotation had failed to meet the solicitation requirement to provide a draft quality control plan.  AR,  Tab 8, OReady Unsuccessful Vendor Notice at 1.  
OReady filed an agency -level protest  on February 28,  contending that NOAA had 
unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  AR, Tab 9, Agency -Level Protest.  On March 26, 
NOAA denied the  agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 10, Agency -Level Protest Decision 
at 8.  OReady , subsequently,  filed a timely protest with our Office on April 1.   
 DISCUSSION  The protester argues that NOAA unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  Specifically, OReady contends that the agency improperly found that the protester’s quotation failed to include a draft quality control plan (QCP), and that the agency should have engaged 
in clarifications with the protester about the QCP.  Protest at 3.  The agency responds that its evaluation of the protester’s quotation was reasonable, and the agency was not

Law (MOL) at 6,  8.  We have reviewed all of the protester’s arguments, and we find no 
basis to sustain the protest.   
 
Technical Quotation  
 The agency eliminated OReady from the competition for failing to include a draft QCP in 
its quotation.  AR, Tab 7, Award Determination at 2.  The protester argues that it did, in fact, include the required plan in its quotation.  Protest at 3.   
 The agency conducted this procurement using simplified acquisition procedures for 
commercial services.  When using these procedures , an agency must conduct the 
procurement consistent with a concern for fair and equitable competition and must evaluate quotations in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.   Axxeum, Inc .,

challenging an agency ’s evaluation under simplified procedures, our Office will not 
reevaluate quotations, but instead, will examine the record to determine whether the agency ’s judgment was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria

B-423198, Feb. 26, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶ 54 at 3.   A protester ’s disagreement with the 
agency ’s judgment, without more, is not sufficient to establish that the agency acted

 Here, under the management approach factor, the solicitation required vendors  to: 
 
Provide a draft Quality Control Plan that demonstrates how quality, as outlined in the PWS’ performance standards, will be met.  The Offeror 
must provide performance measures in addition to those stated in the PWS that are meaningful, measurable, challenging and show the Offeror’s ability to meet the objectives identified in the PWS.  
 RFQ at 54.   The solicitation also noted that “[t]he Quality Control Plan will be evaluated 
to determine how well the Offeror demonstrates quality oversight and how quality standards, as outlined in the Performance Requirements Summary, will be achieved and maintained during performance.”  Id. at 81.   
 The record reflects  that OReady, in response to the RFQ, submitted a 12- page 
technical quotation.  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation.  Within that quotation, 
the only reference to a  QCP appeared on page 4 , which stated:   
 
Quality Assurance:  A  draft Quality Control Plan will be developed and 
implemented.   This plan will include performance measures such as 
system uptime, incident response times, and adherence to security standards.  These metrics will be regularly reviewed to ensure high- quality 
service delivery.   Page 4 B-422910.2   
Id. at 4.  The agency notes, and the record confirms, that although OReady  state d that it 
will develop a draft QCP, no QCP --draft or otherwise--was included in the protester’s 
quotation.  See  id.; see also MOL at 6 (“The plain language of OReady’s quote 
demonstrates OReady did not provide a draft QCP as required by the Solicitation but merely expressed that a plan would be drafted in the future.”).  
 In its comments to the agency report, OReady references  multiple pages of  its technical 
quotation where the firm allegedly included information pertaining to a draft quality 
control plan.  Comments at 1 (citing “Pages 12- 14,” “Pages 15- 16,” and “Pages 22- 24”).  
However, as NOAA explains --and the record confirms --OReady’s technical quotation 
did not include those pages  or, for that matter, any pages after page 12 of the technical 
quotation.  MOL at 6; AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation.   
 Our review of OReady’s 12- page technical quotation confirms  that no information in the 
quotation was responsive to the solicitation’s QCP requirement.  The record reflects that 
on the final page--page 12--of the technical quotation, OReady closed with the following 
conclusory statement : 
 
We further confirm that we fully understand the requirement of the project, SOW  [statement of work], and fully abide by the experience and 
certification requirement of the staff.  We hereby acknowledge and agree 
to any and all addendums to this solicitation.  We can be reached via the 
contact information above if any additional information is needed.  
 
AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation at 12.  This statement was followed by the 
signature of OReady’s authorized representative,  with nothing else following the 
signature.  Id.   
 Although the protester contends  that information about its draft QCP was found 
throughout pages 12- 24 of its technical quotation, OReady does not refute the agency’s 
statement that the protester’s technical quotation was only 12 pages long.   Nor, for that 
matter, has the protester disclaimed the technical quotation provided in the agency report at t ab 4 as being incorrect or otherwise not reflective of the quotation that was 
submitted by OReady in response to the solicitation.  In fact, the quotation that O Ready 
submitted as an exhibit to its protest was 12 pages long and is, otherwise, identical to the technical quotation provided as Tab 4 to the agency report.  Compare Protest, 
exh. 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation with  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation.  
 As we have consistently explained, it is a firm ’s responsibility to submit a well -written 
quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements.   Mission Analytics, LLC , supra at 5; Axxeum, Inc. , 
supra at 5.  Wh en a solicitation requires the submission of information bearing on 
technical acceptability, the protester must demonstrate its quotation is technically sufficient; there is no requirement that the government ferret out information wit h 
respect to informationally deficient quotations .  Axxeum, Inc. , supra  at 5.  Here, the  Page 5 B-422910.2  record clearly demonstrates that OReady did not submit a draft QCP  with its quotation, 
as was required by the solicitation.  RFQ at 54;  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical 
Quotation.  Consistent with the solicitation, the agency reasonably concluded that 
OReady’s quotation was technically unacceptable.  Id. at 53; AR,  Tab 7, Award 
Determination at 2.  Therefore, w e find no basis to sustain t his allegation.  Trade Links 
Logistics Gen. Trading Co. , supra at 5 (finding reasonable agency’s conclusion  of 
technical unacceptability where protester’s quotation indicated protester would provide a 
QCP in the future, but did not include QCP in quotation, as was required by the solicitation).  
 Clarifications  
 The protester also contends that NOAA should have sought clarifications from OReady 
if the agency was unable to find the QCP in the quotation.  In this regard, OReady asserts, “[e]ven if NOAA viewed the QCP’s format as unclear, the agency could have sought clarification,” and that it was unreasonable for NOAA to disqualify “OReady without engaging.”   Protest at 3.   
 As noted, NOAA conducted the procurement  using simplified acquisition procedures.  
These procedures grant contracting officers broad discretion to develop suitable 
evaluation procedures and do not require the agency to engage in exchanges, either clarifications or discussions, with vendors after quotations are submitted.  FAR 13.106-
2(b); Axxeum, Inc ., supra  at 5-6.  As a general matter, agencies may, but are not 
required to, engage in clarifications that give vendors  an opportunity to clarify certain 
aspects of quotations or to resolve minor clerical errors.  Smokeys Helping Hand, LLC , 
B-422957 et al. , Dec. 3, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 295 at 7.   The FAR expresses no limitations 
on an agency’s discretion here, nor does it provide any suggestive guidance regarding when an agency should engage in clarifications.  See  FAR 15.306(a)(2) ; Mission 
Essential , LLC, B-418767, Aug. 31, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 281 at  8.  In sum, agencies have 
broad discretion as to whether to seek clarifications from vendors, and vendor s have no 
automatic right to clarifications regarding its quotation.   Axxeum, Inc ., supra at 6.   
 In any event, contrary to OReady’s view, the failure to include a draft quality control plan could not be corrected through clarifications.  Clarifications are “ limited exchanges ” 
between the agency and vendors  for the purpose of eliminating minor uncertainties or 
irregularities in a quotation or proposal, and do not give a vendor  the opportunity to 
revise or modify its  quotation or  proposal .  FAR 15.306(a) ; American Material Handling, 
Inc., B-410899, Mar. 12, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 106 at 5.  Clarifications are not to be used 
to cure quotation deficiencies  or material omissions, or materially alter the technical or 
cost elements of the quotation, or otherwise revise the quotation.  American Material 
Handling, Inc. , supra.   Discussions, on the other hand, occur when an agency 
communicates with a vendor  for the purpose of obtaining information essential to 
determine the acceptability of a quotation, or provides the vendor  with an opportunity to 
revise or modify its  quotation in some material respect.   Innovative Quality Sols., LLC , 
B-419009.2, Dec. 17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 407 at 6.    
  Page 6 B-422910.2  Here , the record reflects that the technical quotation NOAA received from OReady was 
only 12 pages and did not include a draft QCP.  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical 
Quotation.  To the extent the protester is arguing that  the QCP  (or contents of a QCP) 
could be found in OReady’s quotation after page 12,  that part of the quotation does not 
exist in the record--nor for that matter, has it ever been produced by the protester during the course of this protest.  See e.g.,  Protest, exh. 4, Protester’s Technical Q uotation.  
Thus , to become eligible for award, OReady  would have been required to submit a 
revised technical quotation that included a draft QCP.  Providing a vendor  the 
opportunity to revise its quotation and cure a deficiency would constitute discussions, 
not clarifications, because that would require the revision of information that was a condition- precedent to being eligible for award.   FAR 15.306(d); ProMar; Urethane 
Prods. Corp. , B-292409 et al., Aug. 25, 2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 187 at 8.   Therefore, 
OReady’s contention that NOAA was essentially obligated to seek clarifications regarding the protester’s failure to include a draft QCP in its quotation is without merit.  
ProMar; Urethane Prods. Corp. , supra.  
 Remaining Challenges  
 The protester also argues that the agency’s “shifting justification reveals lack of [a] fair evaluation.”  Protest at 3.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates  that, but for 
the agency’s improper actions it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-417418 et al. , July 3, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 246 at 4.  
Here, consistent with the RFQ, the agency found O Ready’s failure to submit a draft 
QCP rendered the quotation unacceptable and,  therefore,  ineligible for award.  RFQ 
at 53.  Because we find the agency’s conclusion to be reasonable, in this regard, the 
protester is not prejudiced even if the remainder of the evaluation w as unreasonable.  
Dependable Disposal and Recycling, B -400929, Feb. 3, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 69 at 4.  We 
therefore need not resolve any of the protester’s remaining allegations, as the protester still would remain ineligible for award were we to sustain any of t hem.  See DGG RE

 Here, under the management approach factor, the solicitation required vendors  to: 
 
Provide a draft Quality Control Plan that demonstrates how quality, as outlined in the PWS’ performance standards, will be met.  The Offeror 
must provide performance measures in addition to those stated in the PWS that are meaningful, measurable, challenging and show the Offeror’s ability to meet the objectives identified in the PWS.  
 RFQ at 54.   The solicitation also noted that “[t]he Quality Control Plan will be evaluated 
to determine how well the Offeror demonstrates quality oversight and how quality standards, as outlined in the Performance Requirements Summary, will be achieved and maintained during performance.”  Id. at 81.   
 The record reflects  that OReady, in response to the RFQ, submitted a 12- page 
technical quotation.  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation.  Within that quotation, 
the only reference to a  QCP appeared on page 4 , which stated:   
 
Quality Assurance:  A  draft Quality Control Plan will be developed and 
implemented.   This plan will include performance measures such as 
system uptime, incident response times, and adherence to security standards.  These metrics will be regularly reviewed to ensure high- quality 
service delivery.   Page 4 B-422910.2   
Id. at 4.  The agency notes, and the record confirms, that although OReady  state d that it 
will develop a draft QCP, no QCP --draft or otherwise--was included in the protester’s 
quotation.  See  id.; see also MOL at 6 (“The plain language of OReady’s quote 
demonstrates OReady did not provide a draft QCP as required by the Solicitation but merely expressed that a plan would be drafted in the future.”).  
 In its comments to the agency report, OReady references  multiple pages of  its technical 
quotation where the firm allegedly included information pertaining to a draft quality 
control plan.  Comments at 1 (citing “Pages 12- 14,” “Pages 15- 16,” and “Pages 22- 24”).  
However, as NOAA explains --and the record confirms --OReady’s technical quotation 
did not include those pages  or, for that matter, any pages after page 12 of the technical 
quotation.  MOL at 6; AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation.   
 Our review of OReady’s 12- page technical quotation confirms  that no information in the 
quotation was responsive to the solicitation’s QCP requirement.  The record reflects that 
on the final page--page 12--of the technical quotation, OReady closed with the following 
conclusory statement : 
 
We further confirm that we fully understand the requirement of the project, SOW  [statement of work], and fully abide by the experience and 
certification requirement of the staff.  We hereby acknowledge and agree 
to any and all addendums to this solicitation.  We can be reached via the 
contact information above if any additional information is needed.  
 
AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation at 12.  This statement was followed by the 
signature of OReady’s authorized representative,  with nothing else following the 
signature.  Id.   
 Although the protester contends  that information about its draft QCP was found 
throughout pages 12- 24 of its technical quotation, OReady does not refute the agency’s 
statement that the protester’s technical quotation was only 12 pages long.   Nor, for that 
matter, has the protester disclaimed the technical quotation provided in the agency report at t ab 4 as being incorrect or otherwise not reflective of the quotation that was 
submitted by OReady in response to the solicitation.  In fact, the quotation that O Ready 
submitted as an exhibit to its protest was 12 pages long and is, otherwise, identical to the technical quotation provided as Tab 4 to the agency report.  Compare Protest, 
exh. 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation with  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical Quotation.  
 As we have consistently explained, it is a firm ’s responsibility to submit a well -written 
quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements.   Mission Analytics, LLC , supra at 5; Axxeum, Inc. , 
supra at 5.  Wh en a solicitation requires the submission of information bearing on 
technical acceptability, the protester must demonstrate its quotation is technically sufficient; there is no requirement that the government ferret out information wit h 
respect to informationally deficient quotations .  Axxeum, Inc. , supra  at 5.  Here, the  Page 5 B-422910.2  record clearly demonstrates that OReady did not submit a draft QCP  with its quotation, 
as was required by the solicitation.  RFQ at 54;  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical 
Quotation.  Consistent with the solicitation, the agency reasonably concluded that 
OReady’s quotation was technically unacceptable.  Id. at 53; AR,  Tab 7, Award 
Determination at 2.  Therefore, w e find no basis to sustain t his allegation.  Trade Links 
Logistics Gen. Trading Co. , supra at 5 (finding reasonable agency’s conclusion  of 
technical unacceptability where protester’s quotation indicated protester would provide a 
QCP in the future, but did not include QCP in quotation, as was required by the solicitation).  
 Clarifications  
 The protester also contends that NOAA should have sought clarifications from OReady 
if the agency was unable to find the QCP in the quotation.  In this regard, OReady asserts, “[e]ven if NOAA viewed the QCP’s format as unclear, the agency could have sought clarification,” and that it was unreasonable for NOAA to disqualify “OReady without engaging.”   Protest at 3.   
 As noted, NOAA conducted the procurement  using simplified acquisition procedures.  
These procedures grant contracting officers broad discretion to develop suitable 
evaluation procedures and do not require the agency to engage in exchanges, either clarifications or discussions, with vendors after quotations are submitted.  FAR 13.106-
2(b); Axxeum, Inc ., supra  at 5-6.  As a general matter, agencies may, but are not 
required to, engage in clarifications that give vendors  an opportunity to clarify certain 
aspects of quotations or to resolve minor clerical errors.  Smokeys Helping Hand, LLC , 
B-422957 et al. , Dec. 3, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 295 at 7.   The FAR expresses no limitations 
on an agency’s discretion here, nor does it provide any suggestive guidance regarding when an agency should engage in clarifications.  See  FAR 15.306(a)(2) ; Mission 
Essential , LLC, B-418767, Aug. 31, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 281 at  8.  In sum, agencies have 
broad discretion as to whether to seek clarifications from vendors, and vendor s have no 
automatic right to clarifications regarding its quotation.   Axxeum, Inc ., supra at 6.   
 In any event, contrary to OReady’s view, the failure to include a draft quality control plan could not be corrected through clarifications.  Clarifications are “ limited exchanges ” 
between the agency and vendors  for the purpose of eliminating minor uncertainties or 
irregularities in a quotation or proposal, and do not give a vendor  the opportunity to 
revise or modify its  quotation or  proposal .  FAR 15.306(a) ; American Material Handling, 
Inc., B-410899, Mar. 12, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 106 at 5.  Clarifications are not to be used 
to cure quotation deficiencies  or material omissions, or materially alter the technical or 
cost elements of the quotation, or otherwise revise the quotation.  American Material 
Handling, Inc. , supra.   Discussions, on the other hand, occur when an agency 
communicates with a vendor  for the purpose of obtaining information essential to 
determine the acceptability of a quotation, or provides the vendor  with an opportunity to 
revise or modify its  quotation in some material respect.   Innovative Quality Sols., LLC , 
B-419009.2, Dec. 17, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 407 at 6.    
  Page 6 B-422910.2  Here , the record reflects that the technical quotation NOAA received from OReady was 
only 12 pages and did not include a draft QCP.  AR, Tab 4, Protester’s Technical 
Quotation.  To the extent the protester is arguing that  the QCP  (or contents of a QCP) 
could be found in OReady’s quotation after page 12,  that part of the quotation does not 
exist in the record--nor for that matter, has it ever been produced by the protester during the course of this protest.  See e.g.,  Protest, exh. 4, Protester’s Technical Q uotation.  
Thus , to become eligible for award, OReady  would have been required to submit a 
revised technical quotation that included a draft QCP.  Providing a vendor  the 
opportunity to revise its quotation and cure a deficiency would constitute discussions, 
not clarifications, because that would require the revision of information that was a condition- precedent to being eligible for award.   FAR 15.306(d); ProMar; Urethane 
Prods. Corp. , B-292409 et al., Aug. 25, 2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 187 at 8.   Therefore, 
OReady’s contention that NOAA was essentially obligated to seek clarifications regarding the protester’s failure to include a draft QCP in its quotation is without merit.  
ProMar; Urethane Prods. Corp. , supra.  
 Remaining Challenges  
 The protester also argues that the agency’s “shifting justification reveals lack of [a] fair evaluation.”  Protest at 3.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates  that, but for 
the agency’s improper actions it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-417418 et al. , July 3, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 246 at 4.  
Here, consistent with the RFQ, the agency found O Ready’s failure to submit a draft 
QCP rendered the quotation unacceptable and,  therefore,  ineligible for award.  RFQ 
at 53.  Because we find the agency’s conclusion to be reasonable, in this regard, the 
protester is not prejudiced even if the remainder of the evaluation w as unreasonable.  
Dependable Disposal and Recycling, B -400929, Feb. 3, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 69 at 4.  We 
therefore need not resolve any of the protester’s remaining allegations, as the protester still would remain ineligible for award were we to sustain any of t hem.  See DGG RE

agency determined that the most immediate project had been eliminated from the

and funding was not available to make an award.  
DECISION  
 Davenergy -VCI JV, LLC, a small business of Apex, North Carolina, protests the 
cancellation of solicitation No. W9127N24R0029, issued by the Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, for architectural engineering construction management services for medical facility construction projects required by the Department of Veteran 
Affairs (VA) in Oregon and Washington.  The protester contends that the agency’s cancellation of the solicitation is unreasonable and improper . 
 We deny  the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On March 1, 2024,  using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 36.6 
procedures, the Army Corps of Engineers issued the synopsis  seeking an architect -
engineer firm to provide construction management services  “to build medical facilities 
that serve our Veterans throughout the state[s] of Oregon and Washington.”  
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, Synopsis at 1.  
The synopsis contemplated the award of a single indefinite- delivery , indefinite -quantity  Page 2 B-423332  (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance  of five years , beginning on the date of 
contract award, and a “total capacity” of $25 million.  Id.  at 2.   
 
The synopsis further state d that the IDIQ contract would have a minimum guaranteed 
amount of  $10,000, a minimum task order amount of $3,000, and that “[m] ultiple  task 
orders are anticipated to be awarded between $1M and $5M in support of this project. ”  
Id.  The synopsis identified six upcoming VA projects as follows:  
 
Location  Construction Contract Type  ECC (DFARS 236.204)[1] 
Portland [District VA 
(DVA)]  Phase 2  Design -Build  Over $500,000,000  
White City Package 1  Design -Build  $250,000,000 - $500,000,000  
White City Package 2  Design -Bid-Build  $25,000,000 - $100,000,000  
Roseburg VA  To be determined (T BD) $250,000,000 - $500,000,000  
America Lake VA  TBD TBD 
Seattle VA  TBD TBD 
 
Id. at 3.  On September 27, 2024, the agency advised the protester that it was  found to 
be the most highly qualified firm, and the agency would send a formal solicitation in the 
coming weeks.  Protest at 5.  However, on February 13, 2025, the agency informed the 
protester :  “Unfortunately, the U.S Army Corp of Engineers, Portland District, needs to 
cancel the subject requirement and solicitation in its entirety in accordance with FAR 
15.206(e).  Should a similar requirement be identified in the future a new solicitation will be issued.”   Id. at 6.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the decision to cancel the solicitation is unreasonable and unjustified by the agency.  Protest at 2.  The agency responds that cancellation of the 
solicitation was reasonable because some of the anticipated projects have been canceled and it does not otherwise have the funding to support the requirement.  For the reasons discussed below, we find the agency reasonably canceled the solicitation and deny the protest.  
 As an initial matter, the protester contends, and the agency concedes, that FAR section 15.206(e) is inapplicable and improperly cited in the cancellation letter.
2  Protest at 6; 
 
1 The FAR requires that a solicitation  state  the estimated cost of construction (ECC) “in 
terms of physical characteristics and estimated price range.”  FAR 36.204.  The Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) prescribes additional price ranges exceeding $10,000,000.  DFARS 236.204.  
2 That FAR section states:  “If, in the judgment of the contracting officer, based on 
market research or otherwise, an amendment proposed for issuance after offers have been received is so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could 
(continued...)   Page 3 B-423332  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   However, the agency argues that even if FAR section 
15.206(e) was incorrectly  cited, this error does not constitute a procurement violation 
where a reasonable basis for cancellation of the solicitation otherwise exists.  We agree.  
As discussed below, the record shows that the agency canceled the solicitation 
because the requirements changed, and it no longer had funding to proceed with an award.  Accordingly, we dismiss  this allegation.
3  See U.S. Marine Mgmt. , Inc. ,  
B-417353.3, B -417353.4, Sept. 23, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 346 at 4 (“[N]ew or additional 
rationale justifying the cancellation of a solicitation provided by an agency during the development of a protest is acceptable so long as it would have supported cancellation had it been advanced originally.”) .   
 Regarding cancellation of the solicitation, t he agency explains  that the most immediate 
requirements have been canceled by the Portland District VA and associated funding 
returned to the VA, and the next  scheduled project  listed in the synopsis will not occur 
for well over a year .  Req. for Dismissal at 2; COS at 1  (¶¶ 2 and 4 ).  Specifically, t he 
contracting officer states:  “I canceled the Solicitation due to the removal of Portland DVA Phase 2 as a requirement and because the first requirement [White City Package 1] would now not be needed until May 2026 at earliest.”  Id.  (¶ 6).  The contracting 
officer further states that the VA has not yet provided funding to the Corps for the construction phase of White City Package 1 or for any of the remaining projects 
included in the synopsis.
4  Supp. COS at 1 (¶¶ 3 and 4).  
 
 
have anticipated, so that additional sources likely would have submitted offers had the substance of the amendment been known to them, the contracting officer shall cancel the original solicitation and issue a new one, regardless of the stage of the acquis ition. ”  
FAR 15.206(e).   As discussed in this decision, a change in the requirements did not 
exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated;  to the contrary, 
requirements were removed from the procurement.   Moreover, the agency did not 
propose to issue an amendment to the solicitation.  Accordingly, FAR section 15.206(e) 
is not applicable to this procurement . 
3 The protester also argues that a “dismissed size protest” and “unusual circumstances 
surrounding the lack of communication from [the agency],” including a change in the contracting officer assigned to the procurement, are “highly irregular.”  Protest at 3.  In 
this regard, the record shows that a challenge to the size status of the protester, filed on November 15, 2024, was subsequently dismissed by the Small Business Administration as untimely and was unrelated to the agency’s decision to cancel the solicitation.  Supp. COS at 1 (¶ 1).  Moreover, the protester’s general dissatisfaction with the frequency or content of the agency’s communications fails to establish that a violation of procurement statute or regulation occurred.  Accordingly, we find this allegation to be legally and factually insufficient and therefore dismiss it.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4), 21.5(f).  
4 The agency also explains that VA projects are funded using interagency agreement 
forms that give the Corps the authority to spend VA funds,  and that the agreement 
associated with this project was modified to return all funding to the VA.  Supp. COS at 1 (¶ 2).   Page 4 B-423332  In rebuttal , the protester contends that proceeding with the solicitation is justified 
because it will ensure that the contract is in place before the White City Package 1 
project begins , and the remaining projects further  justify proceeding with the solicitation 
and contract negotiation and award.  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1 (“Two of the noted 
projects are over $250 million dollars.  Even with a conservative estimate of typical 
construction management contracts for this Agency, either one of those pr ojects justify 
this IDIQ by themselves. ”).  The protester further contends  that it is “not unusual for 
indefinite delivery contracts to be awarded and not used for a period of time due to fluctuating requirements –  this is the reason to award this flexible contract in the first 
place. ”  Resp. to Supp. COS at 2.   
 In a negotiated procurement, such as the one here, a contracting agency has broad discretion in deciding whether to cancel a solicitation and need only establish a reasonable basis for doing so.  See  T.W. Recycling , B-413256, Sept. 16, 2016, 2016 
CPD ¶ 261 at 4; SupplyCore Inc. , B-411015.8, May 27, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 153 at 3.  A 
reasonable basis to cancel exists when an agency determines that a solicitation does not accurately reflect its needs.  RCR Props., G.P. , B-414590, July 21, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 231 at 3.  For example, cancellation of a procurement is reasonable when the agency determines that it no longer has a requirement for the item solicited.  Lasmer Indus., Inc., B-400866.2 et al. , Mar. 30, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 77 at 4- 5.   
 It is also well established that an agency’s lack of funding for a procurement provides a reasonable basis for cancellation, as agencies may not award contracts that exceed available funds.  Welch Constr., Inc. , B-411879, Nov. 9, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 351 at 2; 
VetPride Servs., Inc. , B-401435, July 28, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 156 at 2.  It is not our role 
to question the unavailability of funds.  Welch Constr., Inc. , supra; VetPride Servs., Inc. , 
supra at 3.  Rather, the management of an agency’s funds generally depends on the 
agency’s judgment concerning which projects and activities should receive increased or  reduced funding.  T.W. Recycling , supra.  Moreover, an agency may properly cancel a 
solicitation regardless of when the information precipitating the cancellation first surfaces or should have been known.  Henry’s Aerial Serv., Inc.; Evergreen Flying Servs., Inc. , B-414238.7; B -414238.9, Aug. 10, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 257 at 5.  
 Here, the synopsis stated that the architect -engineer firm would  be required to review 
and validate work performed under construction contracts  awarded for the upcoming VA 
projects.  S ynopsis at 1 (“The contractor awarded this [construction management 
services architectural -engineering single- award task order contract] will be required to 
review and validate work performed under construction contracts[.]”) ; id. at 3 (“Work 
may be performed on VA mega construction, VA general construction, or VA services and supply contracts to monitor contractor progress and document compliance with the 
plans, specifications, and ancillary documents.”) .  The record shows that  approximately 
four months after the protester was selected  as the most highly qualified firm , the Corps 
was directed by the VA to cancel the solicitation and return the funding for the Portland 
DVA Phase 2  project , the first anticipated project  included in the synopsis.  AR, Tab 7, 
Letter from VA to Army, Jan. 22, 2025.  The record further shows that funding for the Portland DVA Phase 2 project was returned to the VA and was the only funding ever  Page 5 B-423332  provided to the Corps for any of the upcoming VA projects included in the synopsis .  
Supp. COS at 1 (¶ 4).  Thus, we find reasonable the agency’s decision to cancel the 
solicitation where the initial project was no longer required, and the agency represents it 
does  not currently have funding to make an award.  
 The protester also argues:  “ The cancellation of Portland DVA phase 2 (January 22, 
2025) did not happen for almost [four]  months after our selection, and this seems to be 
the sole reason given for the cancellation.  It appears to us there is some other pre-
textual reason for the delays and subsequent attempted cancellation that we are not aware of. ”  Resp. to Supp. COS  at 3.  According to the protester,  
 
Re-advertising the same requirement in the near future for work just over 
[one]  year away is wasteful to the Government, as well as introducing 
significant risk that the contract and accompanying task order would not be placed in time for the potential requirement.  This scenario would 
cause unnecessary re- work on behalf of the industry and more 
importantly, wasting Government resources managing another lengthy procurement process that was already advertised, evaluated, interviewed, and selected.  The Gover nment and each industry 
respondent will spend significantly more than the $10,000 guaranteed minimum that seems to be at issue here.  
 Id. 
 As discussed, an agency may properly cancel a solicitation regardless of when the 
information precipitating the cancellation first surfaces or should have been known, even if the solicitation is not canceled until after proposals have been submitted and evaluated, or even after a contract has been awarded.  Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , 
B-419989.6, B -419989.7, Feb. 28, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 59 at 8 .  In this case, w e do not 
find the lapse in time between the protester’s selection and the cancellation of the solicitation --a four -month period during which a size protest occurred--to be a significant 
delay.  In deed, the concern raised by the protester , namely  that time and resources will 
be wasted by the cancellation,  could only be further compounded if the agency were to 
proceed with the solicitation  and none of the upcoming projects  are funded by the VA in 
the future.  As stated, it is not our role to question the unavailability of funds.  Welch 
Constr., Inc., supra; VetPride Servs., Inc., supra at 3.  Ther e is nothing in the record to 
support  the protester’s claim  that delays in issuing the solicitation and its  subsequent 
cancel lation  indicate the agency’s actions  are pretextual and given that government 
officials are presumed to act in good faith, we find no merit to these allegations.  See Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , supra at 9.   
 
In sum, the initial project included in the synopsis was no longer required, the next 
project is not planned to commence for over a year, and the agency represents that it currently lacks funding for any of the remaining project requirements.  Under these  
  Page 6 B-423332  circumstances, we find no basis to conclude that the agency’s decision to cancel the 
solicitation was unreasonable or improper.   
 The protest is denied.

1 The FAR requires that a solicitation  state  the estimated cost of construction (ECC) “in 
terms of physical characteristics and estimated price range.”  FAR 36.204.  The Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) prescribes additional price ranges exceeding $10,000,000.  DFARS 236.204.  
2 That FAR section states:  “If, in the judgment of the contracting officer, based on 
market research or otherwise, an amendment proposed for issuance after offers have been received is so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could 
(continued...)   Page 3 B-423332  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   However, the agency argues that even if FAR section 
15.206(e) was incorrectly  cited, this error does not constitute a procurement violation 
where a reasonable basis for cancellation of the solicitation otherwise exists.  We agree.  
As discussed below, the record shows that the agency canceled the solicitation 
because the requirements changed, and it no longer had funding to proceed with an award.  Accordingly, we dismiss  this allegation.

B-417353.3, B -417353.4, Sept. 23, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 346 at 4 (“[N]ew or additional 
rationale justifying the cancellation of a solicitation provided by an agency during the development of a protest is acceptable so long as it would have supported cancellation had it been advanced originally.”) .   
 Regarding cancellation of the solicitation, t he agency explains  that the most immediate 
requirements have been canceled by the Portland District VA and associated funding 
returned to the VA, and the next  scheduled project  listed in the synopsis will not occur 
for well over a year .  Req. for Dismissal at 2; COS at 1  (¶¶ 2 and 4 ).  Specifically, t he 
contracting officer states:  “I canceled the Solicitation due to the removal of Portland DVA Phase 2 as a requirement and because the first requirement [White City Package 1] would now not be needed until May 2026 at earliest.”  Id.  (¶ 6).  The contracting 
officer further states that the VA has not yet provided funding to the Corps for the construction phase of White City Package 1 or for any of the remaining projects 
included in the synopsis.

have anticipated, so that additional sources likely would have submitted offers had the substance of the amendment been known to them, the contracting officer shall cancel the original solicitation and issue a new one, regardless of the stage of the acquis ition. ”  
FAR 15.206(e).   As discussed in this decision, a change in the requirements did not 
exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated;  to the contrary, 
requirements were removed from the procurement.   Moreover, the agency did not 
propose to issue an amendment to the solicitation.  Accordingly, FAR section 15.206(e) 
is not applicable to this procurement . 
3 The protester also argues that a “dismissed size protest” and “unusual circumstances 
surrounding the lack of communication from [the agency],” including a change in the contracting officer assigned to the procurement, are “highly irregular.”  Protest at 3.  In 
this regard, the record shows that a challenge to the size status of the protester, filed on November 15, 2024, was subsequently dismissed by the Small Business Administration as untimely and was unrelated to the agency’s decision to cancel the solicitation.  Supp. COS at 1 (¶ 1).  Moreover, the protester’s general dissatisfaction with the frequency or content of the agency’s communications fails to establish that a violation of procurement statute or regulation occurred.  Accordingly, we find this allegation to be legally and factually insufficient and therefore dismiss it.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4), 21.5(f).  
4 The agency also explains that VA projects are funded using interagency agreement 
forms that give the Corps the authority to spend VA funds,  and that the agreement 
associated with this project was modified to return all funding to the VA.  Supp. COS at 1 (¶ 2).   Page 4 B-423332  In rebuttal , the protester contends that proceeding with the solicitation is justified 
because it will ensure that the contract is in place before the White City Package 1 
project begins , and the remaining projects further  justify proceeding with the solicitation 
and contract negotiation and award.  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1 (“Two of the noted 
projects are over $250 million dollars.  Even with a conservative estimate of typical 
construction management contracts for this Agency, either one of those pr ojects justify 
this IDIQ by themselves. ”).  The protester further contends  that it is “not unusual for 
indefinite delivery contracts to be awarded and not used for a period of time due to fluctuating requirements –  this is the reason to award this flexible contract in the first 
place. ”  Resp. to Supp. COS at 2.   
 In a negotiated procurement, such as the one here, a contracting agency has broad discretion in deciding whether to cancel a solicitation and need only establish a reasonable basis for doing so.  See  T.W. Recycling , B-413256, Sept. 16, 2016, 2016 
CPD ¶ 261 at 4; SupplyCore Inc. , B-411015.8, May 27, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 153 at 3.  A 
reasonable basis to cancel exists when an agency determines that a solicitation does not accurately reflect its needs.  RCR Props., G.P. , B-414590, July 21, 2017, 2017 CPD

 It is also well established that an agency’s lack of funding for a procurement provides a reasonable basis for cancellation, as agencies may not award contracts that exceed available funds.  Welch Constr., Inc. , B-411879, Nov. 9, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 351 at 2;

 Here, the synopsis stated that the architect -engineer firm would  be required to review 
and validate work performed under construction contracts  awarded for the upcoming VA 
projects.  S ynopsis at 1 (“The contractor awarded this [construction management 
services architectural -engineering single- award task order contract] will be required to 
review and validate work performed under construction contracts[.]”) ; id. at 3 (“Work 
may be performed on VA mega construction, VA general construction, or VA services and supply contracts to monitor contractor progress and document compliance with the 
plans, specifications, and ancillary documents.”) .  The record shows that  approximately 
four months after the protester was selected  as the most highly qualified firm , the Corps 
was directed by the VA to cancel the solicitation and return the funding for the Portland 
DVA Phase 2  project , the first anticipated project  included in the synopsis.  AR, Tab 7, 
Letter from VA to Army, Jan. 22, 2025.  The record further shows that funding for the Portland DVA Phase 2 project was returned to the VA and was the only funding ever  Page 5 B-423332  provided to the Corps for any of the upcoming VA projects included in the synopsis .  
Supp. COS at 1 (¶ 4).  Thus, we find reasonable the agency’s decision to cancel the 
solicitation where the initial project was no longer required, and the agency represents it 
does  not currently have funding to make an award.  
 The protester also argues:  “ The cancellation of Portland DVA phase 2 (January 22, 
2025) did not happen for almost [four]  months after our selection, and this seems to be 
the sole reason given for the cancellation.  It appears to us there is some other pre-
textual reason for the delays and subsequent attempted cancellation that we are not aware of. ”  Resp. to Supp. COS  at 3.  According to the protester,  
 
Re-advertising the same requirement in the near future for work just over 
[one]  year away is wasteful to the Government, as well as introducing 
significant risk that the contract and accompanying task order would not be placed in time for the potential requirement.  This scenario would 
cause unnecessary re- work on behalf of the industry and more 
importantly, wasting Government resources managing another lengthy procurement process that was already advertised, evaluated, interviewed, and selected.  The Gover nment and each industry 
respondent will spend significantly more than the $10,000 guaranteed minimum that seems to be at issue here.  
 Id. 
 As discussed, an agency may properly cancel a solicitation regardless of when the 
information precipitating the cancellation first surfaces or should have been known, even if the solicitation is not canceled until after proposals have been submitted and evaluated, or even after a contract has been awarded.  Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , 
B-419989.6, B -419989.7, Feb. 28, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 59 at 8 .  In this case, w e do not 
find the lapse in time between the protester’s selection and the cancellation of the solicitation --a four -month period during which a size protest occurred--to be a significant 
delay.  In deed, the concern raised by the protester , namely  that time and resources will 
be wasted by the cancellation,  could only be further compounded if the agency were to 
proceed with the solicitation  and none of the upcoming projects  are funded by the VA in 
the future.  As stated, it is not our role to question the unavailability of funds.  Welch 
Constr., Inc., supra; VetPride Servs., Inc., supra at 3.  Ther e is nothing in the record to 
support  the protester’s claim  that delays in issuing the solicitation and its  subsequent 
cancel lation  indicate the agency’s actions  are pretextual and given that government 
officials are presumed to act in good faith, we find no merit to these allegations.  See Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , supra at 9.   
 
In sum, the initial project included in the synopsis was no longer required, the next 
project is not planned to commence for over a year, and the agency represents that it currently lacks funding for any of the remaining project requirements.  Under these  
  Page 6 B-423332  circumstances, we find no basis to conclude that the agency’s decision to cancel the 
solicitation was unreasonable or improper.   
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 Fusion Technology, LLC, of Bridgeport, West Virginia,  protests the issuance of a task 
order to Trilogy Innovations, Inc., of Bridgeport, West Virginia,  under request for 
quotations (RFQ) No. RFQ -09232022, issued by the Department of Justice, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  for digital and information technology services .  The 
protester primarily challenges the agency’s price realism evaluation and rejection of its 
quotation as unrealistic.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 By way of background, this protest follows several rounds of protests and agency voluntary corrective action over the course of this procurement.  See, e.g.,   
ManTech Advanced Sys. Int’l, Inc. , B-421560.4, Aug. 14, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 210; 
Fusion Tech., LLC , B-421560.11, Oct.  7, 2024 (unpublished decision).  On DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  The entire decision has now 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the 
agency issued the RFQ to vendors with a General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contract under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  According to the RFQ, the agency seeks to acquire agile teams, each comprised of three to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJ IS).  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 (RFQ).
1  The RFQ 
explains that an agile team is a “cross -functional group of individuals who define, build, 
test, and deliver an increment of value,” and that these teams will apply a “Scaled Agile Framework ” (SAFe), which is “an enterprise agility framework that helps organizations 
apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.”  Id.  at 4-5. 
 The RFQ seeks to establish five time- and-materials and fixed- price task orders --
collectively called “FBI Agility with SAFe Teams” --one for each of five service areas for 
the FBI’s CJIS.  Each task order is identified by a separate contract line item number  
(CLIN) --this protest concerns the task order issued under CLIN 3, National Crime 
Information Center, which was set aside for small businesses.
2  RFQ  at 5.  The period 
of performance for each task order includes a base period of one year, including a 3-month transition period and 9- month base period, and four 12- month option periods.  
Id. at 16.   
 
The RFQ provides for award on a best -value tradeoff basis, applying a three- phase 
advisory down- selection evaluation approach in which vendors were instructed to 
submit certain volumes of their quotations and the agency would evaluate them in each phase under the following factors:  phase one (facility clearance; corporate experience; 
staffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology demonstration); and phase 
three (price).
3  The RFQ advises that:  phase one is more important than phase two; 
phase two is more important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become

final conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All 
citations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this decision.  
2 The other CLINs are:  CLIN  1, law enforcement support services; CLIN  2, biometric 
services; CLIN  4, shared services; and CLIN  5, operational programs.  Two of the 
CLINs are set aside for small businesses, while the other three CLINs are unrestricted.  RFQ  at 10- 12.  Subject to the set -aside conditions, vendors could submit quotations for 
more than one CLIN.  Id.  at 53.  The agency advises that it has cancelled CLIN  4.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1 n.1.  
3 With the exception of the facility clearance factor, which would be rated on a pass/fail 
basis, each non- price factor would be evaluated and assigned a confidence rating of 
high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.  RFQ a t 66-67.  Also, in phase 
three, vendors were instructed to address organizational conflicts of interest, if applicable, provide a key personnel management list,  and address acquisition risk 
questions.  Id.  at 49.   Page 3 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  more similar in nature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important 
in the best -value tradeoff decision.  Id. at 61.   The RFQ also explains that, at the 
conclusion of phases one and two, the agency would provide vendors with a notice that would advise them whether the agency believed they should proceed to the next phase.   
The RFQ notes that the purpose of the advisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id.  at 62-63. 
 The price factor in phase three is relevant here.  For the price factor, the RFQ provides:  
 
The Government will conduct three separate realism evaluations to determine whether the Quoter’s low price reflects a lack of understanding of contract requirements or risk inherent in the Quoter’s Phase One’s technical solution[.]  In the realism evaluati ons described below, each 
mapped Quoted Rate will be evaluated against the (1) GSA  CALC+ 
[contract awarded labor categories] published rates, (2) historical rates, and (3)  IGCE [independent government cost estimate] rates established 
for each corresponding Government defined  LCAT [labor category].  If one 
or more of the evaluations are deemed unrealistic, the Quoter’s Price Volume will be deemed unrealistic.  
 Id. at 65. 
 The RFQ provides that , in the first evaluation ( “LCAT Pricing Tab” ), the agency would  
“compare[] the Quoted Rates to [the] three government data points” --GSA CALC+ rates, 
historical rates, and IGCE rates --to assess the realism of rates proposed for each 
LCAT.  Id.   In the second evaluation (“LCAT Instances”), the RFQ provides for 
comparison of the number of instances of unrealistic rates to the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs).   Id. at 65- 66.  In the third evaluation (“Team Impact”), the 
RFQ provides for comparison of the number of teams containing unrealistic LCAT rates to the total number of teams quoted.  Id.  at 66.  
 The RFQ emphasizes that, throughout the evaluations, the agency would compare the quoted rates to the three data points noted above--GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates.  Finally, the RFQ provides that, after completing the evaluations, the agency would conduct an “additional review” of the quotation, including the price and 
technical volumes of the quotation, and determine whether the unrealistic aspects reflected a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or unacceptable risk.  Id. 
at 66.  
 In early 2024, the agency received various quotations, including those from Fusion and Trilogy.  The agency evaluated the quotations and selected Trilogy for award on September 6, 2024; thereafter, Fusion filed its first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  The agency proposed to take corrective action, to include reevaluating and making a new award decision, and we dismissed that protest as academic.  Fusion Tech., LLC , supra.   Page 4 B-421560.13; B -421560.15   
The agency reevaluated the quotations from Fusion and Trilogy4 as follows:  
 
 Fusion  Trilogy  
Corporate Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Staffing Approach  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Demonstration  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Total Evaluated Price  $73,618,896  $93,320,721  
Price Complete, Reasonable, and 
Realistic  No (Unrealistic)  Yes 
 AR, Tab  9, Basis of Award at  9. 
 In concluding that Fusion’s quoted price was unrealistic, the agency determined that the quotation included “a total of 13 LCATs that were determined to be unrealistic and nine (9) of the 13 LCATs were determined to be uncorrectable ( i.e., even with a 0 [percent] 
discount from the Fully Burdened Rate, Fusion cannot become realistic).”  Id.  at 14; see 
also AR, Tab 7 -1, Price Report at  9-10; AR, Tab 7- 2, Price Realism Performance Risk 
Assessment at  2.  For these 13 LCATs, Fusion quoted rates that were lower than at 
least two of the three data points.  See  also COS at  11-14.  The agency further 
determined that a total of 25 of the 66 FTEs, and 8 of the 9 teams, would be affected by the unrealistic rates over the period of performance.  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price Report 
at 10-11.  The agency conducted an additional review of Fusion’s quotation and 
concluded that the risk could not be mitigated.  For example, the agency noted that its strategy to mitigate the risks of using junior level LCATs by pairing them with senior level LCATs, is “not a viable option for Fusion if both positions are not able to be staffed 
or staffed with under -skilled personnel due to unrealistically low pricing.”  AR, Tab  9, 
Basis of Award at  14; see also AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk 
Assessment at  2 (further noting that “[s]ignificant impact to the CLIN’s velocity and 
capacity would be expected with Fusion’s solution”).  Based on its overall evaluation, 
the agency concluded that “Fusion’s price quote is unrealistic, reflecting a high -
performance risk the Government will not accept.”  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  14.   
 The evaluation authority considered the evaluation, compared the quotations, and documented the award decision.  The evaluation authority summarized the concerns with Fusion’s unrealistic price, highlighting that “[s]ignificant impact to the program’s velocity and capacity are expected based on Fusion’s staffing solution and its solution is deemed high risk.”  Id.   The evaluation authority noted that, while Fusion received 
ratings of high confidence under three non- price factors and quoted a lower price, “t he 
 
4 The agency notes that, after numerous protests and corrective actions, Fusion and 
Trilogy were the only two companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  3 task 
order.  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  3.  The agency also notes that both vendors 
passed the facility clearance factor, which, as noted above, was evaluated in phase one 
on a pass/fail basis.  Id.  at 5.  Page 5 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  Government is not willing to accept the risks associated with its unrealistically low -price 
quote and being able to successfully staff the contract.”  Id.   The evaluation authority 
noted that Trilogy’s quotation also received ratings of high confidence and was 
“complete, reasonable, and realistic”; in the evaluation authority’s view, “Trilogy’s highly technically rated solution, with its realistic pricing, is worth the price premium.”  Id.  
 On December 20, the agency again selected Trilogy for award and notified Fusion of its decision.  AR, Tab 10, Unsuccessful Quoter Letter at 1- 2.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  First, Fusion argues that the agency “wrongly concluded [that] Fusion’s LCAT pricing was unrealistically low.”  Protest at  6.  More specifically, Fusion asserts that it was 
“irrational” for the agency to have considered whether Fusion’s quotation “clear[ed]” more than one of the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE 
rates --maintaining that the solicitation should have been interpreted as requiring offerors 
to meet “ only one of the three.”  Comments and Supp. Protest at 2; Supp. Comm ents 
at 3.  In this context, Fusion acknowledges that it prepared its quotation by “picking one” 
of the three benchmarks that it believed each quoted rate would “surpass.”  Supp. Comments at 2- 3.  Accordingly, Fusion asserts that the agency’s price realism  
evaluation reflected application of unstated evaluation criteria.
5  Comments and Supp. 
Protest at  4. 
 
As noted above, the RFQ required the agency to conduct three separate realism 
evaluations to determine whether a vendor’s “low price reflects a lack of understanding 
of contract requirements or risk inherent in” the vendor’s technical solution.  This 
evaluation would include evaluating a firm’s labor rates against three benchmarks --GSA 
CALC+ rates, historical rates, and the IGCE.  RFQ at  65-66.  The agency argues that 
 
5 In its various protest submissions, Fusion has raised arguments that are in addition to, 
or variations of, those specifically discussed below regarding the agency’s price realism 
analysis.  We have considered all of Fusion’s arguments and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, Fusion also complains that the agency failed to adequately document its price realism analysis.  Fusion acknowledges that the contemporaneous evaluation record includes a table showing each rate Fusion 
quoted, along with the corresponding rates the agency used for each data point, and a calculation of the variance between the quoted rates and the benchmark rates.  Supp. Comments at 2; see, e.g., AR,  Tab 13, IGCE, GSA CALC+, and Historical Rates 
Spreadsheet; AR, Tab  14, Quoted Labor Rates and Evaluation Variance Spreadsheet; 
AR, Tab  15, Unrealistic LCAT Rates, Fusion, Spreadsheet .  While an agency’s 
evaluation judgments in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement must be documented in sufficient detail to show that they are reasonable, section 8.405- 2(f) of the FAR 
establishes minimum  documentation requirements .  See, e.g., HII Mission Driven 
Innovative Sols., Inc. , B-421221.4, B -421221.5, Apr. 25, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶  105 at 7.  
On the record here, we reject Fusion’s assertion that the agency’s price realism evaluation was inadequately documented.   Page 6 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  the solicitation clearly informed offerors that quoted labor rates would be compared to 
all three data points; notes that, if the agency had determined that meeting a single benchmark was sufficient, the RFQ would have so stated; and explains that “utilizi ng 
one data point would bring more risk to [contract performance].”  Supp. COS at 2- 3.  
Further, the agency notes that, in assessing risk, the agency considered the potential impact the unrealistic rates would have on Fusion’s proposal.  See  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price 
Report at  9-10; AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk Assessment at  2.  In 
short, the agency maintains that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and it was unreasonable for Fusion to assume that only one of the data points would be considered in the agency’s determination of price realism.  Supp. COS at 2- 3; Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  2. 
 As an initial matter, we note that this competition was conducted under the Federal Supply Schedule procedures of FAR subpart 8.4.  The FAR explains that supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices, and services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates or at a fixed- price for performance of a specific task.  
FAR 8.404(d).  Further, while the procedures of FAR part 15 were not used here, we 
note that as a general matter, in a fixed- price environment, procuring agencies do not  
necessarily have to consider price realism when evaluating quotations because fixed-price vehicles place the risk of loss on the contractor rather than on the government.  Patronus Sys., Inc. , B-418784, B -418784.2, Sept. 3, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  291 at 4; 
Laboratory Corp. of America, B -407108, Nov.  5, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  313 at 5.  However, 
as here, an agency may include in a solicitation a provision that provides for a price realism evaluation for the purpose of assessing whether an offeror’s low price reflects a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or the risk inherent in a proposal.  
FAR 15.404- 1(d)(3); see also Patronus Sys., Inc. , supra  at 4. 
 The FAR identifies a number of  price analysis techniques that may be used to 
determine whether prices are reasonable and realistic, including analysis of pricing information provided by vendors .  FAR 15.404- 1(b)(2).  The nature of the analysis 
required to assess whether a vendor’s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack 
of technical competence or understanding is  within the agency’s discretion.  AMEC 
Earth & Envtl., Inc., B -404959.2, July 12, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 168 at 8.  Agencies may 
use a variety of price evaluation methods  to assess realism, including a comparison of 
prices received to one another, to previously proposed or historically paid prices, or to an independent government estimate.  General Dynamics -Ordnance & Tactical Sys. ,

 Further, where, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our 
Office will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable 
and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 58

without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  DEI Consulting ,

every aspect of an evaluation factor so long as the agency’s evaluation is reasonably related to or encompassed by the stated criteria.  Id.  
 Here, Fusion does not meaningfully contest the agency’s determination that a significant number of the labor rates Fusion quoted were below two of the three data points that the solicitation repeatedly stated would be used to assess price realism.  Rather,  Fusion 
asserts that, so long as each quoted rate “cleared” one of the data points, the agency was required to find that labor rate realistic.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  3.  The 
solicitation, however, did not contain any such requirement.  As noted above, the solicitation simply stated that each quoted rate would be compared to the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates --and further, that the agency 
would rely on those comparisons and conduct additional review to consider t he impact 
on the vendor’s quoted solution.   Because the solicitation did not specify whether a labor rate had to exceed one, two, or three of the benchmarks to be considered realistic, it was for the agency to evaluate the risk posed by labor rates that fell below any of the benchmarks identified by  the 
solicitation.  As noted above, t he nature of the analysis required to assess whether a 
vendor’s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack of technical competence or 
understanding is  within the agency’s discretion, and agencies may use a var iety of price 
evaluation methods to assess realism .  AMEC Earth & Envtl., Inc. , supra at 8; General 
Dynamics -Ordnance & Tactical Sys. , supra  at 3.  While Fusion may have preferred an 
evaluation where a labor rate was deemed realistic so long as it exceeded one of the three benchmarks, it has not provided any basis for our Office to conclude that the agency was unreasonable in finding labor rates bel ow two of the three benchmarks 
unrealistic.  At its core, Fusion’s argument amounts to nothing more than disagreement with the agency’s judgment.  On this record, Fusion’s protest is without merit, and this protest ground is denied.   Remaining Protest Grounds  
 While Fusion also challenges various aspects of the agency’s evaluation under the corporate experience factor,
6 we need not further address them because, even were it 
to prevail on those grounds, the protester has not established a reasonable possibility of 
competitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable 
protest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, Mar.  31, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 79 at  3.

 Fusion does not argue that Trilogy should have been eliminated under the corporate experience factor.  Indeed, Fusion acknowledges that the success of its corporate experience evaluation challenges is contingent on the agency also changing its price evaluation--that is, Fusion argues that “[h]ad the Agency properly evaluated Trilogy’s corporate experience, Fusion would have had a decided advantage under the factor, all but ensuring award to Fusion following a remediated price realism evaluation.”  Supp. Com ments at  2, 9; see also Comments and Supp. Protest at 10 n.5 (acknowledging that

prejudice.  Specifically, any changes to the corporate experience evaluation as alleged by Fusion would not negate the agency’s conclusion that Fusion’s unrealistic price 
presented risks that were unacceptable to the agency, rendering the quotation ineligible for award.

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging the agency’s price realism evaluation and determination that the protester’s price was unrealistic is denied where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable law and regulation.  
DECISION  
 Fusion Technology, LLC, of Bridgeport, West Virginia,  protests the issuance of a task 
order to Trilogy Innovations, Inc., of Bridgeport, West Virginia,  under request for 
quotations (RFQ) No. RFQ -09232022, issued by the Department of Justice, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  for digital and information technology services .  The 
protester primarily challenges the agency’s price realism evaluation and rejection of its 
quotation as unrealistic.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 By way of background, this protest follows several rounds of protests and agency voluntary corrective action over the course of this procurement.  See, e.g.,   
ManTech Advanced Sys. Int’l, Inc. , B-421560.4, Aug. 14, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 210; 
Fusion Tech., LLC , B-421560.11, Oct.  7, 2024 (unpublished decision).  On DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  The entire decision has now 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the 
agency issued the RFQ to vendors with a General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contract under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  According to the RFQ, the agency seeks to acquire agile teams, each comprised of three to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJ IS).  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 (RFQ).
1  The RFQ 
explains that an agile team is a “cross -functional group of individuals who define, build, 
test, and deliver an increment of value,” and that these teams will apply a “Scaled Agile Framework ” (SAFe), which is “an enterprise agility framework that helps organizations 
apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.”  Id.  at 4-5. 
 The RFQ seeks to establish five time- and-materials and fixed- price task orders --
collectively called “FBI Agility with SAFe Teams” --one for each of five service areas for 
the FBI’s CJIS.  Each task order is identified by a separate contract line item number  
(CLIN) --this protest concerns the task order issued under CLIN 3, National Crime 
Information Center, which was set aside for small businesses.
2  RFQ  at 5.  The period 
of performance for each task order includes a base period of one year, including a 3-month transition period and 9- month base period, and four 12- month option periods.  
Id. at 16.   
 
The RFQ provides for award on a best -value tradeoff basis, applying a three- phase 
advisory down- selection evaluation approach in which vendors were instructed to 
submit certain volumes of their quotations and the agency would evaluate them in each phase under the following factors:  phase one (facility clearance; corporate experience; 
staffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology demonstration); and phase 
three (price).
3  The RFQ advises that:  phase one is more important than phase two; 
phase two is more important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become 
 
1 The agency  has amended the RFQ  thirteen times.  References to the RFQ are to the 
final conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All 
citations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this decision.  
2 The other CLINs are:  CLIN  1, law enforcement support services; CLIN  2, biometric 
services; CLIN  4, shared services; and CLIN  5, operational programs.  Two of the 
CLINs are set aside for small businesses, while the other three CLINs are unrestricted.  RFQ  at 10- 12.  Subject to the set -aside conditions, vendors could submit quotations for 
more than one CLIN.  Id.  at 53.  The agency advises that it has cancelled CLIN  4.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1 n.1.  
3 With the exception of the facility clearance factor, which would be rated on a pass/fail 
basis, each non- price factor would be evaluated and assigned a confidence rating of 
high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.  RFQ a t 66-67.  Also, in phase 
three, vendors were instructed to address organizational conflicts of interest, if applicable, provide a key personnel management list,  and address acquisition risk 
questions.  Id.  at 49.   Page 3 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  more similar in nature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important 
in the best -value tradeoff decision.  Id. at 61.   The RFQ also explains that, at the 
conclusion of phases one and two, the agency would provide vendors with a notice that would advise them whether the agency believed they should proceed to the next phase.   
The RFQ notes that the purpose of the advisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id.  at 62-63. 
 The price factor in phase three is relevant here.  For the price factor, the RFQ provides:  
 
The Government will conduct three separate realism evaluations to determine whether the Quoter’s low price reflects a lack of understanding of contract requirements or risk inherent in the Quoter’s Phase One’s technical solution[.]  In the realism evaluati ons described below, each 
mapped Quoted Rate will be evaluated against the (1) GSA  CALC+ 
[contract awarded labor categories] published rates, (2) historical rates, and (3)  IGCE [independent government cost estimate] rates established 
for each corresponding Government defined  LCAT [labor category].  If one 
or more of the evaluations are deemed unrealistic, the Quoter’s Price Volume will be deemed unrealistic.  
 Id. at 65. 
 The RFQ provides that , in the first evaluation ( “LCAT Pricing Tab” ), the agency would  
“compare[] the Quoted Rates to [the] three government data points” --GSA CALC+ rates, 
historical rates, and IGCE rates --to assess the realism of rates proposed for each 
LCAT.  Id.   In the second evaluation (“LCAT Instances”), the RFQ provides for 
comparison of the number of instances of unrealistic rates to the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs).   Id. at 65- 66.  In the third evaluation (“Team Impact”), the 
RFQ provides for comparison of the number of teams containing unrealistic LCAT rates to the total number of teams quoted.  Id.  at 66.  
 The RFQ emphasizes that, throughout the evaluations, the agency would compare the quoted rates to the three data points noted above--GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates.  Finally, the RFQ provides that, after completing the evaluations, the agency would conduct an “additional review” of the quotation, including the price and 
technical volumes of the quotation, and determine whether the unrealistic aspects reflected a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or unacceptable risk.  Id. 
at 66.  
 In early 2024, the agency received various quotations, including those from Fusion and Trilogy.  The agency evaluated the quotations and selected Trilogy for award on September 6, 2024; thereafter, Fusion filed its first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  The agency proposed to take corrective action, to include reevaluating and making a new award decision, and we dismissed that protest as academic.  Fusion Tech., LLC , supra.   Page 4 B-421560.13; B -421560.15   
The agency reevaluated the quotations from Fusion and Trilogy4 as follows:  
 
 Fusion  Trilogy  
Corporate Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Staffing Approach  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Demonstration  High Confidence  High Confidence  
Total Evaluated Price  $73,618,896  $93,320,721  
Price Complete, Reasonable, and 
Realistic  No (Unrealistic)  Yes 
 AR, Tab  9, Basis of Award at  9. 
 In concluding that Fusion’s quoted price was unrealistic, the agency determined that the quotation included “a total of 13 LCATs that were determined to be unrealistic and nine (9) of the 13 LCATs were determined to be uncorrectable ( i.e., even with a 0 [percent] 
discount from the Fully Burdened Rate, Fusion cannot become realistic).”  Id.  at 14; see 
also AR, Tab 7 -1, Price Report at  9-10; AR, Tab 7- 2, Price Realism Performance Risk 
Assessment at  2.  For these 13 LCATs, Fusion quoted rates that were lower than at 
least two of the three data points.  See  also COS at  11-14.  The agency further 
determined that a total of 25 of the 66 FTEs, and 8 of the 9 teams, would be affected by the unrealistic rates over the period of performance.  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price Report 
at 10-11.  The agency conducted an additional review of Fusion’s quotation and 
concluded that the risk could not be mitigated.  For example, the agency noted that its strategy to mitigate the risks of using junior level LCATs by pairing them with senior level LCATs, is “not a viable option for Fusion if both positions are not able to be staffed 
or staffed with under -skilled personnel due to unrealistically low pricing.”  AR, Tab  9, 
Basis of Award at  14; see also AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk 
Assessment at  2 (further noting that “[s]ignificant impact to the CLIN’s velocity and 
capacity would be expected with Fusion’s solution”).  Based on its overall evaluation, 
the agency concluded that “Fusion’s price quote is unrealistic, reflecting a high -
performance risk the Government will not accept.”  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  14.   
 The evaluation authority considered the evaluation, compared the quotations, and documented the award decision.  The evaluation authority summarized the concerns with Fusion’s unrealistic price, highlighting that “[s]ignificant impact to the program’s velocity and capacity are expected based on Fusion’s staffing solution and its solution is deemed high risk.”  Id.   The evaluation authority noted that, while Fusion received 
ratings of high confidence under three non- price factors and quoted a lower price, “t he 
 
4 The agency notes that, after numerous protests and corrective actions, Fusion and 
Trilogy were the only two companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  3 task 
order.  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  3.  The agency also notes that both vendors 
passed the facility clearance factor, which, as noted above, was evaluated in phase one 
on a pass/fail basis.  Id.  at 5.  Page 5 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  Government is not willing to accept the risks associated with its unrealistically low -price 
quote and being able to successfully staff the contract.”  Id.   The evaluation authority 
noted that Trilogy’s quotation also received ratings of high confidence and was 
“complete, reasonable, and realistic”; in the evaluation authority’s view, “Trilogy’s highly technically rated solution, with its realistic pricing, is worth the price premium.”  Id.  
 On December 20, the agency again selected Trilogy for award and notified Fusion of its decision.  AR, Tab 10, Unsuccessful Quoter Letter at 1- 2.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  First, Fusion argues that the agency “wrongly concluded [that] Fusion’s LCAT pricing was unrealistically low.”  Protest at  6.  More specifically, Fusion asserts that it was 
“irrational” for the agency to have considered whether Fusion’s quotation “clear[ed]” more than one of the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE 
rates --maintaining that the solicitation should have been interpreted as requiring offerors 
to meet “ only one of the three.”  Comments and Supp. Protest at 2; Supp. Comm ents 
at 3.  In this context, Fusion acknowledges that it prepared its quotation by “picking one” 
of the three benchmarks that it believed each quoted rate would “surpass.”  Supp. Comments at 2- 3.  Accordingly, Fusion asserts that the agency’s price realism  
evaluation reflected application of unstated evaluation criteria.
5  Comments and Supp. 
Protest at  4. 
 
As noted above, the RFQ required the agency to conduct three separate realism 
evaluations to determine whether a vendor’s “low price reflects a lack of understanding 
of contract requirements or risk inherent in” the vendor’s technical solution.  This 
evaluation would include evaluating a firm’s labor rates against three benchmarks --GSA 
CALC+ rates, historical rates, and the IGCE.  RFQ at  65-66.  The agency argues that 
 
5 In its various protest submissions, Fusion has raised arguments that are in addition to, 
or variations of, those specifically discussed below regarding the agency’s price realism 
analysis.  We have considered all of Fusion’s arguments and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, Fusion also complains that the agency failed to adequately document its price realism analysis.  Fusion acknowledges that the contemporaneous evaluation record includes a table showing each rate Fusion 
quoted, along with the corresponding rates the agency used for each data point, and a calculation of the variance between the quoted rates and the benchmark rates.  Supp. Comments at 2; see, e.g., AR,  Tab 13, IGCE, GSA CALC+, and Historical Rates 
Spreadsheet; AR, Tab  14, Quoted Labor Rates and Evaluation Variance Spreadsheet; 
AR, Tab  15, Unrealistic LCAT Rates, Fusion, Spreadsheet .  While an agency’s 
evaluation judgments in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement must be documented in sufficient detail to show that they are reasonable, section 8.405- 2(f) of the FAR 
establishes minimum  documentation requirements .  See, e.g., HII Mission Driven 
Innovative Sols., Inc. , B-421221.4, B -421221.5, Apr. 25, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶  105 at 7.  
On the record here, we reject Fusion’s assertion that the agency’s price realism evaluation was inadequately documented.   Page 6 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  the solicitation clearly informed offerors that quoted labor rates would be compared to 
all three data points; notes that, if the agency had determined that meeting a single benchmark was sufficient, the RFQ would have so stated; and explains that “utilizi ng 
one data point would bring more risk to [contract performance].”  Supp. COS at 2- 3.  
Further, the agency notes that, in assessing risk, the agency considered the potential impact the unrealistic rates would have on Fusion’s proposal.  See  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price 
Report at  9-10; AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk Assessment at  2.  In 
short, the agency maintains that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and it was unreasonable for Fusion to assume that only one of the data points would be considered in the agency’s determination of price realism.  Supp. COS at 2- 3; Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  2. 
 As an initial matter, we note that this competition was conducted under the Federal Supply Schedule procedures of FAR subpart 8.4.  The FAR explains that supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices, and services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates or at a fixed- price for performance of a specific task.  
FAR 8.404(d).  Further, while the procedures of FAR part 15 were not used here, we 
note that as a general matter, in a fixed- price environment, procuring agencies do not  
necessarily have to consider price realism when evaluating quotations because fixed-price vehicles place the risk of loss on the contractor rather than on the government.  Patronus Sys., Inc. , B-418784, B -418784.2, Sept. 3, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  291 at 4; 
Laboratory Corp. of America, B -407108, Nov.  5, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  313 at 5.  However, 
as here, an agency may include in a solicitation a provision that provides for a price realism evaluation for the purpose of assessing whether an offeror’s low price reflects a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or the risk inherent in a proposal.  
FAR 15.404- 1(d)(3); see also Patronus Sys., Inc. , supra  at 4. 
 The FAR identifies a number of  price analysis techniques that may be used to 
determine whether prices are reasonable and realistic, including analysis of pricing information provided by vendors .  FAR 15.404- 1(b)(2).  The nature of the analysis 
required to assess whether a vendor’s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack 
of technical competence or understanding is  within the agency’s discretion.  AMEC 
Earth & Envtl., Inc., B -404959.2, July 12, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 168 at 8.  Agencies may

 Further, where, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our 
Office will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable 
and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 58

 Here, Fusion does not meaningfully contest the agency’s determination that a significant number of the labor rates Fusion quoted were below two of the three data points that the solicitation repeatedly stated would be used to assess price realism.  Rather,  Fusion 
asserts that, so long as each quoted rate “cleared” one of the data points, the agency was required to find that labor rate realistic.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  3.  The 
solicitation, however, did not contain any such requirement.  As noted above, the solicitation simply stated that each quoted rate would be compared to the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates --and further, that the agency 
would rely on those comparisons and conduct additional review to consider t he impact

BACKGROUND  
 
The Navy’s Expeditionary Exploitation Unit -1 (EXU- 1) has a requirement to provide 
tactical first responder medical training (hereinafter , medical training) to military 
personnel  operating in various scenarios to include battlefield, remote care, prolonged 
transport, or unique rescue conditions .  The medical training encompasses  the 
treatment of the trauma/casualty  patient with particular emphasis on penetrating, blunt, 
and blast trauma in conjunction with environmental and situational concerns.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 3, Statement of  Page 2 B-423398  Work (SOW) at 1.1  The medical training simulate s a hostile environment where 
students must perform frontline first aid procedures of medical care, the different phases 
of medical care, and triage as they relate to medical care on the battlefield after

3 Despite the use of the phrase “ market research quote”  in the agency  representative’s  
December 10 email, as discussed more fully below, the record indicates that this email 
communication was a specific request for market research information based on the SOW and was not an actual solicitation requesting submission of a proposal or quotation from any vendor.   Page 3 B-423398  agency representative asked each vendor the following:  “ Please provide a market

contracting officer and am not authorized to enter into agreements on behalf of the 
[government].  All contracts and delivery orders will be negotiated by a government contracting officer. ”  Id.   
 After receiving the request for market research information,  ATSCC posed several 
questions to the agency.  For example, on December 11, ATSCC inquired, in relevant part:  “you ask that we respond with a quote as [soon as] we can –  if we were to submit 
[no later than the close of business ] Friday, 13 Dec 24, would that be ok?  I don’t want 
to put [us at] a disadvantage by being too slow on the draw.”  AR, Exh. 2, Email 
Communication from ATSCC.  In a return email of the same date, the agency 
responded that was “totally fine.”  Id.   On December  13, ATSCC submitted another 
question, in relevant part :  “will your office be making award to an offeror based off of 
what is provided [in] response to this [request for quotations (RFQ)] ?” and noted that its 
“response [to the market research request] i s forthcoming. ”  Id.  On January 15, 2025,  
the agency representative responded:  “ Was not sure if I responded to this, but I collect

 In the meantime, on February 13, the agency identified several factors  that impacted its 
ability to move forward with the acquisition.  S pecifically, the agency noted:   
 
• Urgent operational need to ensure EXU- 1 personnel received battlefield trauma 
training prior to deployment, without which, there would be an unacceptable 
compromise to troop safety in hostile and combative environments.  
 
• An immovable first training date of 24 March -26 March 2025, driven by active-
duty military deployment schedules.  
 
• EXU- 1 did not have current year funds available to execute a new training 
requirement [.]  Congress had not passed an appropriations bill or new continuing 
resolution, and the C ontracting Officer lacked authority to issue a solicitation 
without full funding.

4 The record indicates that on January 28, 2025, the agency representative emailed a 
request to ATSCC labeled “ Market Research for 2026 EOD First Responder Medical 
Suite Training. ”  Protest, exh. A, Market Research Req.  However, as discussed, the 
protester’s submitted market research information was in response to the agency’s December 10, 2024,  request to vendors.   AR, Exh. 5, ATSCC’s Capability Statement.   Page 4 B-423398  As a result, on February 13, 2025, the contracting officer sought and received 
authorization to designate this medical training as a mission critical requirement  which 
allowed access to funding in the absence of current year appropriated funds .  COS at 2.  
Thereafter, due to the agency’s time- sensitive needs, the contracting officer determined 
that there was insufficient time to conduct a competitive FAR part  13 acquisition to meet 
the March 24 training schedule.  T he contracting officer concluded that the only way to 
obtain the required training prior to military deployment was to issue a sole-source 
actio n based on urgent justification under FAR section 13.106- 1(b)(1)(i).  The 
contracting officer did not issue a solicitation.   Id.   
 As is relevant , the urgent justification explained as follows:   
 
If EXU- 1 is not able to provide this training requirement, [this] will cause 
issues with rotating military personnel to complete this training and prevent from being able to complete mission requirements.  This would also cause a ripple effect of delaying incoming military personnel to receive training before they report out for mission requirements.  Without the proper training the EXU -1 military personnel would not have 
medical training they need to be prepared for requirements to ensure they are trained for all environment from desert, to urban, to the cold weather encountered at high altitude and everywhere in between.    
 AR, Exh. 4, Urgent Justification at 1.  
 On February 20, the contracting officer received approval of the urgent justification for a 
sole-source action to issue the purchase order to Tactical Electronics , the only vendor 
that submitted a complete capability statement and pricing information in response to the December 2024 market research.  COS at 2.   The contracting officer then drafted 
the sole-source purchase order paperwork and accompanying documentation which 
she forwarded for approval .  COS at 2 ; MOL at  4.   
 Also on February 20, ATSCC emailed its capability statement and pricing information 
(self-identified as a “quote” ) in response to the “ Request for Market Research Quote for 
EOD First Responder Medical Suite Training 20241210. ”  COS at  2; MOL at 4 quoting, 
AR, Exh. 5, ATSCC’s Capability Statement.  The next day, February 21, ATSCC’s 
market research information was forwarded to the contracting officer who took no action 
on the submission b ecause “the paperwork for [ Tactical Electronics ] had already bee n 
approved and routed for final signatures .”  COS at 2.   
 On February 28, the contracting officer issued the fixed -price purchase order to Tactical 
Electronics for a total price of $148,107.58 that included the M arch 24- March 26 base 
period and three option periods.  MOL at  1.  On March 3, Tactical Electronics signed the 
purchase order.  COS at 3.  
 On March 7, the protester emailed the agency representative for a status update to which the agency responded that the “contract was awarded to another vendor by our  Page 5 B-423398  contracts shop . . . [t]hank you so much for submitting a market research quote.”  Req .

As an initial matter , we find no merit to ATSCC’s allegation that the agency’s conduct  
established a competitive RFQ .  The record shows that while the agency 
representative’s emailed request s for market research information used the term 
“quote,”  the email communications unequivocally stated that the representative wa s not 
a contracting officer and that all contracts and delivery orders w ould be negotiated by a 
government contracting officer.  See  e.g., AR, Exh. 2, Req. for Market Research Quote 
for EOD First Responder Medical Suite Training 20241210 (Dec. 10, 2024) .  The record 
also shows that in responding to a question posed by the protester,  the agency 
representative specifically stated that any information provided by the vendor would be 
used only for market research and that any subsequent procurement action would be 
undertaken by the contracting officer.  Id., Email Communication to ATSCC (Jan. 15, 
2025).   
 
In any event, the agency asserts that only the contracting officer has the authority to 
issue solicitations to solicit formal proposals or quotations.  In this regard, had the 
contracting officer intended to issue an RFQ, the agency asserts that the RFQ would 
have included  all relevant solicitation provisions , such as, section B: supplies or 
services; section F:  deliveries or p erformance; section L:  instructions, conditions , and 
notices to o fferors; and section M:  evaluation factors for a ward ; to permit vendors to 
 
5 ATSCC raises other collateral arguments.  While our decision does not specifically 
address each of the argument s, we have reviewed all of the arguments and find that 
none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.    Page 6 B-423398  prepare and submit responsive proposals or quotations .  The agency maintains that no 
such solicitation was issued by the contracting officer.  See MOL at  6.   
 
Based on the record presented, we find no support for the protester’s allegation that the 
agency’s email communications should be construed as  an RFQ .  Nor was the agency 
required to evaluate the protester’s February 20 market research submission,  which 
ATSCC characterizes as a responsive lower -priced quotation.  Accordingly, w e deny 
this aspect of the protest.   
 ATSCC also contends that the agency’s decision to issue a sole- source purchase order 
using the urgency justification of FAR section 13.106- 1(b)(1)(i)  to Tactical Electronics 
was improper  and inconsistent with the competition requirements of the simplified 
acquisition procedures of FAR p art 13.  According to the protester, there was more than 
one source reasonably available to perform the medical training requirements since the 
agency  had received an eligible and cost -effective quotation from ATSCC, another  
known, reliable vendor.  See  Comments at 2- 3.   
 When conducting a procurement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, contracting officers must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies 
and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the government.  41 U.S.C. § 3305(d); FAR 13.104; see also Information Ventures, Inc. , B-293541,  
Apr. 9, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 81 at 3.  As an exception to the general competition 
requirement s, for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a 
contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that 
the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source r easonably available 
(e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand- name or industrial mobilization).  
FAR 13.106- 1(b).  We review an agency’s decision to limit competition under such 
circumstances for reasonableness.  Summit Techs., Inc. , B-419126, B-419126.2,  
Nov. 19, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  384 at 4; Critical Process Filtration, Inc. , B-400746 et al. , 
Jan. 22, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 25 at 5.    
 Here, based on our review of the record discussed above, we reject ATSCC’s 
assertions that the Navy has failed to provide a reasonable justification for its conclusion that only one source was reasonably available to provide the medical training 
requirements prior to the deployment of military troops.  As discussed above, the record 
reflects the Navy’s:  well documented recognition of problems associated with the lack of current year available funding; consideration of other strategies to meet its needs;  the 
need to ensure troop safety by providing medical training prior to deployment; and,  
based on market research, the availability of only one source capable of meeting the 
agency’s needs .  More specifically, the record demonstrates that once the medical 
training was elevated to a mission critical requirement, the operational risks associated with a delay in awa rding the purchase order  would have prevented this missi on critical 
medical training from occurring prior to troop deployment .  The record further 
demonstrates that the Navy reasonably attempted to conduct market research well in advance of its anticipated requirement.  The agency reasonably determined that only one source could satisfy its urgent requirements based on the single t imely response to  Page 7 B-423398  its December 2024 request for market research, and the protester provides no 
reasonable justification for its delay until late February 2025 in providing responsive 
information to the agency’s market research request.  
 
A contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them.  See Ho-olaulima Gov’t Sols., LLC , B-421958, B -421958.2,  
Dec. 19, 2023, 2024 CPD ¶ 10 at 7.  ATSCC’s disagreement with the agency’s needs 
and how to best accommodate them, without more, does not show that the agency’s judgment is unreasonable.  Id.; see also, SSI Tech., Inc ., B-417917, Dec. 4, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 418 at 7.  Accordingly, on this record, we find that the Navy has 
demonstrated a reasonable bas is for issuing the sole- source purchase order to Tactical 
Electronics based on an urgent justification .

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging agency’s issuance of a sole- source purchase order using simplified 
acquisition procedures is denied where the record shows that the agency reasonably determined that there was only one source available to meet the agency’s urgent requirements for first responder medical training prior to military troop deployment .   
DECISION  
 Assessment and Training Solutions Consulting Corporation (ATSCC) , a service-
disabled veteran- owned small business located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, protests the 
issuance of a sole -source fixed -price purchase order to Tactical Electronics and Military 
Supply, LLC  (Tactical Electronics ), of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma,  by the Department of 
the Navy  to provide tactical first responder medical training prior to military troop 
deployment.   ATSCC argues that the agency’s sole- source award is unreasonable and 
contrary to applicable procurement law and regulation.  
 We deny the protest.    
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The Navy’s Expeditionary Exploitation Unit -1 (EXU- 1) has a requirement to provide 
tactical first responder medical training (hereinafter , medical training) to military 
personnel  operating in various scenarios to include battlefield, remote care, prolonged 
transport, or unique rescue conditions .  The medical training encompasses  the 
treatment of the trauma/casualty  patient with particular emphasis on penetrating, blunt, 
and blast trauma in conjunction with environmental and situational concerns.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 3, Statement of  Page 2 B-423398  Work (SOW) at 1.1  The medical training simulate s a hostile environment where 
students must perform frontline first aid procedures of medical care, the different phases 
of medical care, and triage as they relate to medical care on the battlefield after 
neutralizing the enemy threat.  Among other things, the successful contractor will be 
required to equip, train, and certify explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) platoons in 
advance lifesaving skills and techniques used in remote hostile environments without immediate evacuation support.  SOW at 1.   
 To procure these services, t he agency  originally anticipated issuing a solicitation under 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 13.5 , simplified acquisition procedures , 
under which the agency would issue a firm-fixed -price purchase order .  COS at 1.  The 
SOW  accompanying the agency’s December 2024 request for market research 
information anticipated a base performance period of  March  24-26, 2025, with three 
option periods.  SOW at 4.    
 As is r elevant , the agency represents that during the first quarter of the current fiscal 
year a solicitation could not be issued because current year appropriated funding was 
not available.  The agency explains that it was operating under continuing resolution 
authority (CRA) that would not be lifted until March 14, 2025,  which would delay 
execution of a purchase order for the medical training scheduled to begin on March 24.  
COS at  1-2.  Given the importance of this training for military personnel with im pending 
deployments , the agency identified strategies to address the situation, including utiliz ing 
existing Defense Logistics Agency contracts or the purchase card payment method,

concluding that  neither option was appropriate given the terms and conditions of the 
required training .  Id. at 2.   
 While waiting on the availability of funds either through a new CRA or congressional 
appropriation, the contracting officer decided to initiate market research and complete 
all preliminary procurement actions to ensure readiness once funding was appropriated.  
Id.  In conducting its market research, an agency representati ve engaged in an email 
exchange with three vendors, including the protester and the awardee, that was labeled 
as a “request for market research quote.”   AR, Exh. 2, Req. for Market Research Quote

for EOD First Responder Medical Suite Training 20241210 (Dec. 10, 2024) .  The record 
also shows that in responding to a question posed by the protester,  the agency 
representative specifically stated that any information provided by the vendor would be 
used only for market research and that any subsequent procurement action would be 
undertaken by the contracting officer.  Id., Email Communication to ATSCC (Jan. 15, 
2025).   
 
In any event, the agency asserts that only the contracting officer has the authority to 
issue solicitations to solicit formal proposals or quotations.  In this regard, had the 
contracting officer intended to issue an RFQ, the agency asserts that the RFQ would 
have included  all relevant solicitation provisions , such as, section B: supplies or 
services; section F:  deliveries or p erformance; section L:  instructions, conditions , and 
notices to o fferors; and section M:  evaluation factors for a ward ; to permit vendors to

address each of the argument s, we have reviewed all of the arguments and find that 
none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.    Page 6 B-423398  prepare and submit responsive proposals or quotations .  The agency maintains that no 
such solicitation was issued by the contracting officer.  See MOL at  6.   
 
Based on the record presented, we find no support for the protester’s allegation that the 
agency’s email communications should be construed as  an RFQ .  Nor was the agency 
required to evaluate the protester’s February 20 market research submission,  which 
ATSCC characterizes as a responsive lower -priced quotation.  Accordingly, w e deny 
this aspect of the protest.   
 ATSCC also contends that the agency’s decision to issue a sole- source purchase order 
using the urgency justification of FAR section 13.106- 1(b)(1)(i)  to Tactical Electronics 
was improper  and inconsistent with the competition requirements of the simplified 
acquisition procedures of FAR p art 13.  According to the protester, there was more than 
one source reasonably available to perform the medical training requirements since the 
agency  had received an eligible and cost -effective quotation from ATSCC, another  
known, reliable vendor.  See  Comments at 2- 3.   
 When conducting a procurement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, contracting officers must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies 
and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the government.  41 U.S.C. § 3305(d); FAR 13.104; see also Information Ventures, Inc. , B-293541,  
Apr. 9, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 81 at 3.  As an exception to the general competition 
requirement s, for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a 
contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that 
the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source r easonably available 
(e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand- name or industrial mobilization).  
FAR 13.106- 1(b).  We review an agency’s decision to limit competition under such 
circumstances for reasonableness.  Summit Techs., Inc. , B-419126, B-419126.2,  
Nov. 19, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  384 at 4; Critical Process Filtration, Inc. , B-400746 et al. , 
Jan. 22, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 25 at 5.    
 Here, based on our review of the record discussed above, we reject ATSCC’s 
assertions that the Navy has failed to provide a reasonable justification for its conclusion that only one source was reasonably available to provide the medical training 
requirements prior to the deployment of military troops.  As discussed above, the record 
reflects the Navy’s:  well documented recognition of problems associated with the lack of current year available funding; consideration of other strategies to meet its needs;  the 
need to ensure troop safety by providing medical training prior to deployment; and,  
based on market research, the availability of only one source capable of meeting the 
agency’s needs .  More specifically, the record demonstrates that once the medical 
training was elevated to a mission critical requirement, the operational risks associated with a delay in awa rding the purchase order  would have prevented this missi on critical 
medical training from occurring prior to troop deployment .  The record further 
demonstrates that the Navy reasonably attempted to conduct market research well in advance of its anticipated requirement.  The agency reasonably determined that only one source could satisfy its urgent requirements based on the single t imely response to  Page 7 B-423398  its December 2024 request for market research, and the protester provides no 
reasonable justification for its delay until late February 2025 in providing responsive 
information to the agency’s market research request.  
 
A contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them.  See Ho-olaulima Gov’t Sols., LLC , B-421958, B -421958.2,  
Dec. 19, 2023, 2024 CPD ¶ 10 at 7.  ATSCC’s disagreement with the agency’s needs 
and how to best accommodate them, without more, does not show that the agency’s judgment is unreasonable.  Id.; see also, SSI Tech., Inc ., B-417917, Dec. 4, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 418 at 7.  Accordingly, on this record, we find that the Navy has 
demonstrated a reasonable bas is for issuing the sole- source purchase order to Tactical 
Electronics based on an urgent justification .

B-423304,"May 7, 2025","GENCO Systems, Inc","Protest that agency failed to properly consider protester ’s price and unreasonably 
issued Federal Supply Schedule order to higher -priced vendor is denied where the 
record shows the agency ’s source selection decision reasonably determined that 
successful vendor ’s quotation provided the best value under the solicitation criteria.    
DECISION  
 GENCO Systems, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, a small business, protests the General 
Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service ’s issuance of a task order 
under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) to Jay 
Shapiro & Associates, Inc ., of Far Hills, New Jersey .  The agency issued the task order 
under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 47PC0224Q0020, for c onstruction management 
services  at the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Office Building in Jamaica, New York.  
GENCO argues that GSA improperly selected Jay Shapiro’s quotation over GENCO ’s 
lower -priced quotation.   
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 GSA issued the RFQ to firms hold ing FSS multiple -award national BPAs  for 
construction management services, program/project management services, and  Page 2 B-423304  building/lease inspection services --zone 1.1  The RFQ itself (labeled as an “instruction 
to offeror” ) stated that the agency intended to issue a fixed- priced task order to the 
vendor whose quotation provided the best value, which would be determined by “ a 
tradeoff between non- cost factors and cost/price. ”  RFQ at 2.  GSA states that the 
procurement was conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
section 8.405- 3, the provisions of which describe the issuance of BPAs and the process 
for ordering under them.  Memorandum of L aw (MOL ) at 1.  The RFQ listed three 
factors and their weighting:  staffing plan (30 percent), project management plan (30 
percent) and price (40 percent).  Id.  at 2-3.  The project management plan factor was 
divided into two equally weighted subfactors :  quality assurance plan (15 percent) and 
program management plan (15 percent).  Id. at 3.   
 
The statement of work (SOW) for  the RFQ described the required staffing as :  
one (1) Off hours/Night Time Construction Inspector dedicated to providing Off hours and night time inspection services for all ongoing construction projects, one (1) Senior Project Manager / Team Leader, two (2) Senior Construction Managers with mechanical and electrical 
experience, Senior Commissioning Agent, Commissioning Agent and a Commissioning Specialist or equivalent contract labor categories.  
Protest exh. 1, SOW at 4 .
2 
 Under the heading of hours worked, the SOW further specified:  
 
The contractor ’s onsite CM [construction management] staff (onsite CM 
staff includes one (1) Off  hours/Night time inspector –  who shall be onsite 
for 40 hours a week during off hours to include night time to perform construction phase inspection services, a work schedule shall be submitted on weekly basis for GSA approval, this work schedule shall be created based on the construction schedule of all ongoing projects [)].   
 Id. at 2.   
 Two vendors submitted quotations:  GENCO , the incumbent contractor , and Jay 
Shapiro .
3  The evaluation used point scores to indicate the merit of each quotation 
 
1 The term “zone 1” appears to have been used during the competition for the 
underlying FSS BPAs to describe their  geographic scope, which covered multiple GSA 
Public Buildings Service regions.  The RFQ indicates that the Addabbo building is in 
GSA Public Buildings Service region No. 2.  Protest exh. 2, RFQ at 1.   
2 GENCO explains, and GSA does not dispute, that this amounted to four full -time 
positions (one the off hours/night  time position) and three part -time positions.    
3 The record contains a brief reference to a third vendor  and indicates that its quotation 
was ineligible for award.   MOL at 10.   Accordingly , we do not discuss it further.    Page 3 B-423304  under each factor and subfactor, which included assessing a score for the price factor.   
As relevant here, the evaluation concluded that GENCO ’s quotation had what the 
agency refers to as “deficienc ies”4 regarding the firm ’s approach to escalation of issues, 
its project planning, and its staffing of the off -hours/nighttime construction inspector 
position.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  3.   
 
After completing the evaluati on, GSA issued the task order to Jay Shapiro.  GENCO 
requested a brief explanation and then filed an agency -level protest  challenging GSA ’s 
evaluation of the firm ’s quotation and the decision to award the order at a higher price 
as unreasonable and inconsistent with the RFQ .  GSA sustained GENCO ’s protest in 
part, finding that the agency  had improperly weighted the price factor in making the 
best-value determination, and directed the contracting officer to properly weight the 
price factor and make a new source selection decision.  AR, Tab 1, Decision on First 
Agency -Level Protest at  12-13.  The agency denied GENCO ’s remaining challenges.    
 GSA revised the price evaluation and recalculated both firms ’ evaluated scores.  To 
implement the agency -level protest decision, the agency used a revised price evaluation 
scheme that assigned scores to offerors ’ total prices on the following basis:  a pric e 
more than 15 percent below the agency ’s estimate would receive the maximum 
weighted score of 40 points; a price below the estimate by less than 15 percent would receive 30 points; a price equal to or above the estimate by up to 15 percent would receive 20 points; and a price more than 15 percent above the estimate would be 
unacceptable and receive no points.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  2.  
GENCO ’s total evaluated price of $5,570,984 received a price score of 40 points, while 
Jay Shapiro’ s price of $6,622,600.80 received 30 points.  Id. at 3.  The recalculation 
resulted in the following weighted scores : 
 
 GENCO  JAY SHAPIRO  
STAFFING (max 30)  22.875  25.5  
PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN (max 30)  15 22.5 
PRICE (max 40)  40 30 
TOTAL SCORE (max 100)  77.875  78 
 
Id.; Contracting Officer’ s Statement  (COS)  at 5.   
The contracting officer  then reviewed the evaluations in greater detail and noted that 
GENCO ’s quotation contained technical deficiencies :  
 
The QAP [quality assurance plan] does not include how GENCO would address contract issues that require escalation past the Team Lead.  The 
 
4 The RFQ did not define the term “ deficiency ,” and GSA does not argue that the 
presence of one or more deficienc ies rendered GENCO ’s quotation unacceptable or 
otherwise ineligible for award.  Cf.  MOL at 10 (asserting that a third vendor  was 
ineligible for award but not making the same assertion as to GENCO ).    Page 4 B-423304  PMP [project management plan] states that the team lead will be assigned 
projects in “ some cases ” while the SOW [statement of work in the RFQ] 
requires “Team leader will provide CM services oversight for his/her own 
projects. ”  In both the QAP and PMP, GENCO does not discuss GENCO ’s 
approach to preparing requirements in the project planning stage.  GENCO specifies that the inspector is “ Night -time” while the SOW 
specifies “Off-hours ” which may include weekends and Federal Holidays.   
 AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 3; COS at 7.   
 The contracting officer explained that  the evaluation of GENCO ’s quotation had 
identified “many deficiencies,” among which were the firm ’s failure to provide for 
weekend and holiday services.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 4.  The 
contracting officer noted that GENCO’ s total evaluated price was $1,051,616.80 lower 
than Jay Shapiro’ s price of $6,622,600.80, which represented a 17 percent price 
difference in GENCO ’s favor, but that GENCO’ s quotation failed to address all the SOW 
requirements because it did not provide for services on weekends and holidays.  Id.  
The contracting officer  selected Jay Shapiro ’s quotation for award as the best value.  Id.    
 After receiving a brief explanation  of the agency ’s basis for award, GENCO filed a 
second agency -level protest, challenging the evaluation and award decision, which also 
argued that the agency had failed to properly implement the decision in the earlier 
agency -level protest.  GSA denied that second agency -level protest  on January 21, 
2025, AR, Tab 2, Decision on Second Agency -Level Protest at 10, after which GENCO 
filed this protest.    
 
DISCUSSION  Given the at -times confusing nature of the issues presented by the protester and the 
agency ’s response, w e begin with an overview  of the main points argued by each party .  
GENCO ’s protest begins with a history of the procurement and previous protests, and 
then challenge s the technical evaluation and tradeoff .  Protest at  4; see also id. at 6, 8 
(arguing that agency -level protest decision “wrongly sided with the Agency”) .  GENCO 
contends GSA failed to consider its arguments related to the “ unfair and unreasonable”  
best-value determin ation.”  Id. at 4.  That determination was unfair and unreasonable, 
GENCO argues,  because GSA failed to make “a proper trade off as required under 
[FAR]  15.308. ”  Id. at 7.  GENCO argues that Jay Shapiro’ s evaluated price was higher 
than GENCO ’s price and, following the reevaluation,  both firms ’ total scores were 
78 points , meaning that GSA lacked a valid basis to select Jay Shapiro’s  higher -priced 
quotation.  Id.    
GENCO then argues that GSA’ s best -value determination mentioned “unsupported and 
unsubstantiated weaknesses” but “linked only one”  weakness to the best -value 
determination.   Id.  This weakness was labeled a deficiency  for fail ing to address how 
the firm would provide services during “off hours” that could include weekends and 
holidays, but only addressed services during nighttime hours.  Id.  GENCO states that 
its second agency -level protest  challenged that aspect of the evaluation as an “unlisted  Page 5 B-423304  and unstated requirement ,” and argued that the SOW did not indicate that the term “off 
hours” referred to weekends or holidays  and never mentioned the agency ’s requirement 
included services being provided on weekends or holidays .  Id. at 8-9.   
GENCO next takes issue with the statement in the January 21 agency -level protest 
decision that GENCO ’s price quotation failed to cover staffing for “all the contemplated 
off hours[,]” including failing to fully price staffing for the off hours/nighttime construction 
inspector.  Id. at 10.  GENCO disputes that conclusion  and affirms that its price 
quotation used the RFQ ’s pre-filled pricing schedule,  which listed 1920 hours per year 
for each of the four full-time positions , one of which was the off hours/nighttime 
construction inspector ; that is, the protester used the agency ’s specified pricing for the 
position at 1920 hours per year  in the RFQ pricing schedule.  Id.  at 10; see Protest 
exh. 14, GENCO Quotation Price Schedule at  1-2.   
In challenging the source selection decision, GENCO argues that GSA  decided not to 
issue the order to the protester based on “unsubstantiated deficiencies” that the firm 
contends were already rebutted.  Protest at  11.  GENCO also contends that the source 
selection decision lacks a proper tradeoff analysis and,  instead,  GSA “randomly picked 
up a few sentences and made up its own interpretations to make it look like deficiencies to justify a high price award.”  Id.  at 12.  Thus, GENCO argues, GSA failed to identify 
specific benefits or discriminators t o justify paying Jay Shapiro’ s higher price.  Id.   
In the agency report, GSA argues that the protest is entirely improper because it represents an attempt to have GAO review issues already considered by GSA in the two earlier agency -level protests.  As a result, GSA argues, the protest should be 
dismissed.  MOL at 2 (“ This protest is GENCO ’s third bite at the apple”).
5  GSA also 
contends that even if the entire protest is not dismissed on that basis, our Office should dismiss as untimely the protester ’s challenges to the technical evaluation.   
In its comments responding to the agency report, GENCO disputes the characterization 
of its protest as including a challenge to the technical evaluation of its quotation.  Comments at 1; see also id.  at 2.  To the contrary, the protester asserts , its protest 
challenges the decision in response to GENCO ’s second agency -level protest that GSA 
had made a reasonable price reevaluation and best -value tradeoff.  Id.  at 1-2.  GENCO 
 
5 GSA terms GENCO ’s initial agency -level protest (sustained in part) a “first bite” at a 
metaphorical protest apple, the firm ’s next agency -level protest, which challenged the 
new award decision, was a “second bite,” and this protest to our Office is a “third bite” that GSA contends is impermissible and should therefore be dismissed.  MOL at 1- 2.  
We deny GSA ’s argument, which we view as contending that GENCO ’s entire protest is 
untimely.  Our statutory jurisdiction provides no basis to reject a protest simply because 
the issues were raised in one or more earlier agency -level protest s.  See  31 U.S.C. 
§ 3553 (a) (“the Comptroller General shall decide a protest submitted to the Comptroller 
General by an interested party ”).  Consistent with that charge, our timeliness rules 
provide specifically for a protest to be filed with our Office after a decision on an agency -
level protest (or other initial adverse agency action).  4 C.F.R. section 21.2(a)(3).    Page 6 B-423304  contends that GSA ’s agency report  ignores the substance of the protest and does not 
claim that the agency made any tradeoff analysis in reaching its source selection 
decision.  Id.  at 2.  As a result, GENCO argues that since both firms ’ quotations 
received the same total score, GSA had no basis to select Jay Shapiro’ s higher -priced 
quotation for award.  Id.    
GENCO ’s comments then state that its protest “already addressed” the evaluation of a 
deficiency in its quotation for failing to cover services during weekends and holidays, 
and the firm posits that it is unclear whether the agency considered the deficiency in 
making a tradeoff in favor of Jay Shapiro’ s higher price.  Id.  at 3.  Ultimately, GENCO 
argues that the agency ’s position is misleading, confusing, and irrelevant, and that its 
protest should therefore be sustained.  Id.    
In resolving the above various contentions, as an initial matter, we find that GENCO has 
abandoned any challenge to the technical evaluation by flatly stating in its comments that its protest did not challenge the technical evaluation.  Id. at 1 (explaining that the 
“[a]gency report has further gone in length to wrongly describe our protest as a Challenge to the Technical Evaluation while our Protest to GAO is to challenge the Best Value Determination and Trade off analysis ” and “ as mentioned above GENCO is not 
protesting Technical Evaluation”); see also id.  at 2 (“Agency is wrongly describing our 
protest as a challenge to technical evaluation ”).  Instead, t he protester  affirms,  its 
protest to our Office challenges the reevaluation of prices and r esulting source selection 
decision and does not substantively address the response in the agency ’s report.  Id.  
Given GENCO ’s definitive statement in its comments that it does not intent to challenge 
its technical evaluation, we do not consider the protester ’s other --somewhat confusing--
statements to indicate an intent to pursue a challenge to the technical evaluation.  
Further, w here an agency responds to a protester ’s argument in the agency report and 
the protester ’s comments in response fail to address the issue, our Office will consider 
the issue abandoned by the protester.  Crowley Co. , B-258967, Feb. 21, 1995,

Feb. 27, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 77 at  13 n.6.   
Based on our review , GENCO states it is challenging GSA’ s failure to perform corrective 
action required by the first agency -level protest decision.  It also argues that the second 
agency -level protest decision was incorrect .  Apart from the abandoned challenge to the 
assessment of a deficiency under the technical evaluation discussed above, the central 
contention in the protest is that GSA made an unreasonable tradeoff judgment that Jay Shapiro ’s higher -priced quotation was a better value than GENCO ’s despite both firms 
receiving the same overall point scores.  The protester does not raise a specific 
challenge to the calculation of prices or the application of the price scoring scheme; rather, its challenge to the price evaluation seems to be folded into its challenge to the tradeoff:  whether GENCO ’s lower price should have resulted in selection of its 
quotation for award.   
As stated above, t he essence of GENCO ’s remaining argument is that GSA  made an 
unreasonable tradeoff decision by  issuing the order to Jay Shapiro at its higher price.  
The protester contends  that GSA should have selected GENCO ’s quotation for award  Page 7 B-423304  based on its lower price, and the firm notes that after the reevaluation the two firms ’ 
quotations they achieved the same evaluation score of 78 points.6  Id. at 2-3.  
Where a protester challenges the outcome of a competition among FSS vendors under 
FAR subpart 8 for the issuance of an order , and vendors ’ responses form the basis for a 
tradeoff  that is like a competition in a negotiated procurement ( as contrast ed with a 
simple FSS purchase) , we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s selection is 
reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Verizon Fed. , Inc. , 
B-293527, Mar. 26, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 186 at 4 .  When an agency uses point scores to 
compare among FSS vendors , the point scores  serve as guides to intelligent 
decisionmaking.   Castro & Co. , B-412398, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 52 at 10.   Point 
scores do not mandate selection of a particular quotation, however, and source selection officials have broad discretion in determining the manner and extent to which 
they will make use of  the scores  to reach a selection that is rational  and consistent with 
the evaluation criteria.  Id.   
The record here confirms the reasonableness of the contracting officer ’s judgment in 
selecting Jay Shapiro ’s quotation over GENCO ’s despite their receiving the same point 
scores.  Contrary to GENCO’ s argument, the RFQ did not provide for pricing to be the 
deciding factor in the event of a tie; indeed, the point scores already included the 
assessment of points  for each offeror ’s price.  GENCO received 40 points because its 
price was below the government estimate, while Jay Shapiro received 30 because its price was above the estimate.  The resulting calculation of both firms scores at 78 points therefore included a quantification of GENCO ’s price advantage.   
However , as explained above, a reasonable tradeoff required the contracting officer to 
examine  the substance of the evaluations, not just the point scores , and then to 
determine  which vendor offered the best value under the factors specified in the RFQ.  
Id.  Our review of the record shows the contracting officer made just such a reasoned 
judgment .  The contracting officer reasonably determined that selection of Jay Shapiro’ s 
quotation at its higher price represented a better value when compared to GENCO ’s 
quotation which had an evaluated deficiency, even at a lower price.   The record 
adequately documents the contracting officer ’s judgment that, due to the assessment of 
a deficiency to GENCO ’s quotation for failing to address off -hours services on weekend 
and holidays, the firm ’s lower -priced quotation was not the best value when compared 
to Jay Shapiro’ s quotation.   In sum, that judgment was reasonable and consistent with 
the evaluation criteria in the RFQ, so we deny GENCO ’s protest.   
The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez

DIGEST  
 Protest that agency failed to properly consider protester ’s price and unreasonably 
issued Federal Supply Schedule order to higher -priced vendor is denied where the 
record shows the agency ’s source selection decision reasonably determined that 
successful vendor ’s quotation provided the best value under the solicitation criteria.    
DECISION  
 GENCO Systems, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, a small business, protests the General 
Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service ’s issuance of a task order 
under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) to Jay 
Shapiro & Associates, Inc ., of Far Hills, New Jersey .  The agency issued the task order 
under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 47PC0224Q0020, for c onstruction management 
services  at the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Office Building in Jamaica, New York.  
GENCO argues that GSA improperly selected Jay Shapiro’s quotation over GENCO ’s 
lower -priced quotation.   
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 GSA issued the RFQ to firms hold ing FSS multiple -award national BPAs  for 
construction management services, program/project management services, and  Page 2 B-423304  building/lease inspection services --zone 1.1  The RFQ itself (labeled as an “instruction 
to offeror” ) stated that the agency intended to issue a fixed- priced task order to the 
vendor whose quotation provided the best value, which would be determined by “ a 
tradeoff between non- cost factors and cost/price. ”  RFQ at 2.  GSA states that the 
procurement was conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
section 8.405- 3, the provisions of which describe the issuance of BPAs and the process 
for ordering under them.  Memorandum of L aw (MOL ) at 1.  The RFQ listed three 
factors and their weighting:  staffing plan (30 percent), project management plan (30 
percent) and price (40 percent).  Id.  at 2-3.  The project management plan factor was 
divided into two equally weighted subfactors :  quality assurance plan (15 percent) and

 Two vendors submitted quotations:  GENCO , the incumbent contractor , and Jay 
Shapiro .

1 The term “zone 1” appears to have been used during the competition for the 
underlying FSS BPAs to describe their  geographic scope, which covered multiple GSA 
Public Buildings Service regions.  The RFQ indicates that the Addabbo building is in 
GSA Public Buildings Service region No. 2.  Protest exh. 2, RFQ at 1.   
2 GENCO explains, and GSA does not dispute, that this amounted to four full -time 
positions (one the off hours/night  time position) and three part -time positions.    
3 The record contains a brief reference to a third vendor  and indicates that its quotation 
was ineligible for award.   MOL at 10.   Accordingly , we do not discuss it further.    Page 3 B-423304  under each factor and subfactor, which included assessing a score for the price factor.   
As relevant here, the evaluation concluded that GENCO ’s quotation had what the 
agency refers to as “deficienc ies”4 regarding the firm ’s approach to escalation of issues, 
its project planning, and its staffing of the off -hours/nighttime construction inspector 
position.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  3.   
 
After completing the evaluati on, GSA issued the task order to Jay Shapiro.  GENCO 
requested a brief explanation and then filed an agency -level protest  challenging GSA ’s 
evaluation of the firm ’s quotation and the decision to award the order at a higher price 
as unreasonable and inconsistent with the RFQ .  GSA sustained GENCO ’s protest in 
part, finding that the agency  had improperly weighted the price factor in making the 
best-value determination, and directed the contracting officer to properly weight the 
price factor and make a new source selection decision.  AR, Tab 1, Decision on First 
Agency -Level Protest at  12-13.  The agency denied GENCO ’s remaining challenges.    
 GSA revised the price evaluation and recalculated both firms ’ evaluated scores.  To 
implement the agency -level protest decision, the agency used a revised price evaluation 
scheme that assigned scores to offerors ’ total prices on the following basis:  a pric e 
more than 15 percent below the agency ’s estimate would receive the maximum 
weighted score of 40 points; a price below the estimate by less than 15 percent would receive 30 points; a price equal to or above the estimate by up to 15 percent would receive 20 points; and a price more than 15 percent above the estimate would be 
unacceptable and receive no points.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  2.  
GENCO ’s total evaluated price of $5,570,984 received a price score of 40 points, while 
Jay Shapiro’ s price of $6,622,600.80 received 30 points.  Id. at 3.  The recalculation 
resulted in the following weighted scores : 
 
 GENCO  JAY SHAPIRO  
STAFFING (max 30)  22.875  25.5  
PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN (max 30)  15 22.5 
PRICE (max 40)  40 30 
TOTAL SCORE (max 100)  77.875  78 
 
Id.; Contracting Officer’ s Statement  (COS)  at 5.   
The contracting officer  then reviewed the evaluations in greater detail and noted that 
GENCO ’s quotation contained technical deficiencies :  
 
The QAP [quality assurance plan] does not include how GENCO would address contract issues that require escalation past the Team Lead.  The 
 
4 The RFQ did not define the term “ deficiency ,” and GSA does not argue that the 
presence of one or more deficienc ies rendered GENCO ’s quotation unacceptable or 
otherwise ineligible for award.  Cf.  MOL at 10 (asserting that a third vendor  was 
ineligible for award but not making the same assertion as to GENCO ).    Page 4 B-423304  PMP [project management plan] states that the team lead will be assigned 
projects in “ some cases ” while the SOW [statement of work in the RFQ] 
requires “Team leader will provide CM services oversight for his/her own 
projects. ”  In both the QAP and PMP, GENCO does not discuss GENCO ’s 
approach to preparing requirements in the project planning stage.  GENCO specifies that the inspector is “ Night -time” while the SOW 
specifies “Off-hours ” which may include weekends and Federal Holidays.   
 AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 3; COS at 7.   
 The contracting officer explained that  the evaluation of GENCO ’s quotation had 
identified “many deficiencies,” among which were the firm ’s failure to provide for 
weekend and holiday services.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 4.  The 
contracting officer noted that GENCO’ s total evaluated price was $1,051,616.80 lower 
than Jay Shapiro’ s price of $6,622,600.80, which represented a 17 percent price 
difference in GENCO ’s favor, but that GENCO’ s quotation failed to address all the SOW 
requirements because it did not provide for services on weekends and holidays.  Id.  
The contracting officer  selected Jay Shapiro ’s quotation for award as the best value.  Id.    
 After receiving a brief explanation  of the agency ’s basis for award, GENCO filed a 
second agency -level protest, challenging the evaluation and award decision, which also 
argued that the agency had failed to properly implement the decision in the earlier 
agency -level protest.  GSA denied that second agency -level protest  on January 21, 
2025, AR, Tab 2, Decision on Second Agency -Level Protest at 10, after which GENCO 
filed this protest.    
 
DISCUSSION  Given the at -times confusing nature of the issues presented by the protester and the 
agency ’s response, w e begin with an overview  of the main points argued by each party .  
GENCO ’s protest begins with a history of the procurement and previous protests, and 
then challenge s the technical evaluation and tradeoff .  Protest at  4; see also id. at 6, 8 
(arguing that agency -level protest decision “wrongly sided with the Agency”) .  GENCO 
contends GSA failed to consider its arguments related to the “ unfair and unreasonable”  
best-value determin ation.”  Id. at 4.  That determination was unfair and unreasonable, 
GENCO argues,  because GSA failed to make “a proper trade off as required under 
[FAR]  15.308. ”  Id. at 7.  GENCO argues that Jay Shapiro’ s evaluated price was higher 
than GENCO ’s price and, following the reevaluation,  both firms ’ total scores were 
78 points , meaning that GSA lacked a valid basis to select Jay Shapiro’s  higher -priced 
quotation.  Id.    
GENCO then argues that GSA’ s best -value determination mentioned “unsupported and 
unsubstantiated weaknesses” but “linked only one”  weakness to the best -value 
determination.   Id.  This weakness was labeled a deficiency  for fail ing to address how 
the firm would provide services during “off hours” that could include weekends and 
holidays, but only addressed services during nighttime hours.  Id.  GENCO states that 
its second agency -level protest  challenged that aspect of the evaluation as an “unlisted  Page 5 B-423304  and unstated requirement ,” and argued that the SOW did not indicate that the term “off 
hours” referred to weekends or holidays  and never mentioned the agency ’s requirement 
included services being provided on weekends or holidays .  Id. at 8-9.   
GENCO next takes issue with the statement in the January 21 agency -level protest 
decision that GENCO ’s price quotation failed to cover staffing for “all the contemplated 
off hours[,]” including failing to fully price staffing for the off hours/nighttime construction 
inspector.  Id. at 10.  GENCO disputes that conclusion  and affirms that its price 
quotation used the RFQ ’s pre-filled pricing schedule,  which listed 1920 hours per year 
for each of the four full-time positions , one of which was the off hours/nighttime 
construction inspector ; that is, the protester used the agency ’s specified pricing for the 
position at 1920 hours per year  in the RFQ pricing schedule.  Id.  at 10; see Protest 
exh. 14, GENCO Quotation Price Schedule at  1-2.   
In challenging the source selection decision, GENCO argues that GSA  decided not to 
issue the order to the protester based on “unsubstantiated deficiencies” that the firm 
contends were already rebutted.  Protest at  11.  GENCO also contends that the source 
selection decision lacks a proper tradeoff analysis and,  instead,  GSA “randomly picked 
up a few sentences and made up its own interpretations to make it look like deficiencies to justify a high price award.”  Id.  at 12.  Thus, GENCO argues, GSA failed to identify 
specific benefits or discriminators t o justify paying Jay Shapiro’ s higher price.  Id.   
In the agency report, GSA argues that the protest is entirely improper because it represents an attempt to have GAO review issues already considered by GSA in the two earlier agency -level protests.  As a result, GSA argues, the protest should be 
dismissed.  MOL at 2 (“ This protest is GENCO ’s third bite at the apple”).
5  GSA also 
contends that even if the entire protest is not dismissed on that basis, our Office should dismiss as untimely the protester ’s challenges to the technical evaluation.   
In its comments responding to the agency report, GENCO disputes the characterization 
of its protest as including a challenge to the technical evaluation of its quotation.  Comments at 1; see also id.  at 2.  To the contrary, the protester asserts , its protest 
challenges the decision in response to GENCO ’s second agency -level protest that GSA 
had made a reasonable price reevaluation and best -value tradeoff.  Id.  at 1-2.  GENCO 
 
5 GSA terms GENCO ’s initial agency -level protest (sustained in part) a “first bite” at a 
metaphorical protest apple, the firm ’s next agency -level protest, which challenged the 
new award decision, was a “second bite,” and this protest to our Office is a “third bite” that GSA contends is impermissible and should therefore be dismissed.  MOL at 1- 2.  
We deny GSA ’s argument, which we view as contending that GENCO ’s entire protest is 
untimely.  Our statutory jurisdiction provides no basis to reject a protest simply because 
the issues were raised in one or more earlier agency -level protest s.  See  31 U.S.C. 
§ 3553 (a) (“the Comptroller General shall decide a protest submitted to the Comptroller 
General by an interested party ”).  Consistent with that charge, our timeliness rules 
provide specifically for a protest to be filed with our Office after a decision on an agency -
level protest (or other initial adverse agency action).  4 C.F.R. section 21.2(a)(3).    Page 6 B-423304  contends that GSA ’s agency report  ignores the substance of the protest and does not 
claim that the agency made any tradeoff analysis in reaching its source selection 
decision.  Id.  at 2.  As a result, GENCO argues that since both firms ’ quotations 
received the same total score, GSA had no basis to select Jay Shapiro’ s higher -priced 
quotation for award.  Id.    
GENCO ’s comments then state that its protest “already addressed” the evaluation of a 
deficiency in its quotation for failing to cover services during weekends and holidays, 
and the firm posits that it is unclear whether the agency considered the deficiency in 
making a tradeoff in favor of Jay Shapiro’ s higher price.  Id.  at 3.  Ultimately, GENCO 
argues that the agency ’s position is misleading, confusing, and irrelevant, and that its 
protest should therefore be sustained.  Id.    
In resolving the above various contentions, as an initial matter, we find that GENCO has 
abandoned any challenge to the technical evaluation by flatly stating in its comments that its protest did not challenge the technical evaluation.  Id. at 1 (explaining that the 
“[a]gency report has further gone in length to wrongly describe our protest as a Challenge to the Technical Evaluation while our Protest to GAO is to challenge the Best Value Determination and Trade off analysis ” and “ as mentioned above GENCO is not 
protesting Technical Evaluation”); see also id.  at 2 (“Agency is wrongly describing our 
protest as a challenge to technical evaluation ”).  Instead, t he protester  affirms,  its 
protest to our Office challenges the reevaluation of prices and r esulting source selection 
decision and does not substantively address the response in the agency ’s report.  Id.  
Given GENCO ’s definitive statement in its comments that it does not intent to challenge 
its technical evaluation, we do not consider the protester ’s other --somewhat confusing--
statements to indicate an intent to pursue a challenge to the technical evaluation.  
Further, w here an agency responds to a protester ’s argument in the agency report and 
the protester ’s comments in response fail to address the issue, our Office will consider 
the issue abandoned by the protester.  Crowley Co. , B-258967, Feb. 21, 1995, 
95-1 CPD ¶ 105 at 1 n.1; Mountaineers Fire Crew, Inc. et al. , B-413520.5 et al. , 
Feb. 27, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 77 at  13 n.6.   
Based on our review , GENCO states it is challenging GSA’ s failure to perform corrective 
action required by the first agency -level protest decision.  It also argues that the second 
agency -level protest decision was incorrect .  Apart from the abandoned challenge to the 
assessment of a deficiency under the technical evaluation discussed above, the central 
contention in the protest is that GSA made an unreasonable tradeoff judgment that Jay Shapiro ’s higher -priced quotation was a better value than GENCO ’s despite both firms 
receiving the same overall point scores.  The protester does not raise a specific 
challenge to the calculation of prices or the application of the price scoring scheme; rather, its challenge to the price evaluation seems to be folded into its challenge to the tradeoff:  whether GENCO ’s lower price should have resulted in selection of its 
quotation for award.   
As stated above, t he essence of GENCO ’s remaining argument is that GSA  made an 
unreasonable tradeoff decision by  issuing the order to Jay Shapiro at its higher price.  
The protester contends  that GSA should have selected GENCO ’s quotation for award  Page 7 B-423304  based on its lower price, and the firm notes that after the reevaluation the two firms ’ 
quotations they achieved the same evaluation score of 78 points.6  Id. at 2-3.  
Where a protester challenges the outcome of a competition among FSS vendors under 
FAR subpart 8 for the issuance of an order , and vendors ’ responses form the basis for a 
tradeoff  that is like a competition in a negotiated procurement ( as contrast ed with a 
simple FSS purchase) , we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s selection is 
reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Verizon Fed. , Inc. , 
B-293527, Mar. 26, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 186 at 4 .  When an agency uses point scores to 
compare among FSS vendors , the point scores  serve as guides to intelligent 
decisionmaking.   Castro & Co. , B-412398, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 52 at 10.   Point 
scores do not mandate selection of a particular quotation, however, and source selection officials have broad discretion in determining the manner and extent to which 
they will make use of  the scores  to reach a selection that is rational  and consistent with 
the evaluation criteria.  Id.   
The record here confirms the reasonableness of the contracting officer ’s judgment in 
selecting Jay Shapiro ’s quotation over GENCO ’s despite their receiving the same point 
scores.  Contrary to GENCO’ s argument, the RFQ did not provide for pricing to be the 
deciding factor in the event of a tie; indeed, the point scores already included the 
assessment of points  for each offeror ’s price.  GENCO received 40 points because its 
price was below the government estimate, while Jay Shapiro received 30 because its price was above the estimate.  The resulting calculation of both firms scores at 78 points therefore included a quantification of GENCO ’s price advantage.   
However , as explained above, a reasonable tradeoff required the contracting officer to 
examine  the substance of the evaluations, not just the point scores , and then to 
determine  which vendor offered the best value under the factors specified in the RFQ.  
Id.  Our review of the record shows the contracting officer made just such a reasoned 
judgment .  The contracting officer reasonably determined that selection of Jay Shapiro’ s 
quotation at its higher price represented a better value when compared to GENCO ’s 
quotation which had an evaluated deficiency, even at a lower price.   The record 
adequately documents the contracting officer ’s judgment that, due to the assessment of 
a deficiency to GENCO ’s quotation for failing to address off -hours services on weekend 
and holidays, the firm ’s lower -priced quotation was not the best value when compared 
to Jay Shapiro’ s quotation.   In sum, that judgment was reasonable and consistent with 
the evaluation criteria in the RFQ, so we deny GENCO ’s protest.   
The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez  
General Counsel  
 
6 Consistent with its use of the point scores merely as guides, GSA does not assert 
there is any significance to the difference between GENCO ’s actual score of 77.875 
points , rounded to 78 points, and Jay Shapiro’ s score .   "
B-423117.3,"May 28, 2025","Taylor Made Transportation Services, Inc","Protest challenging the agency’s termination of protester’s awarded contract is denied where, upon reevaluation, the agency reasonably found the protester’s proposal to be technically unacceptable.  
DECISION  
 Taylor Made Transportation Services, Inc., a small business of Baltimore, Maryland, protests the reevaluation of its proposal, its elimination from competition, and the termination of its award for the convenience of the government under request for propos als (RFP) No.  36C24524R0044, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) for van shuttle transportation services.  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably reevaluated its proposal as technically unacceptable, and thus, the agency’s decision to terminate the protester’s contract for convenience was improper.  
 We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the solicitation on May 14, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, as a small business set -aside.
1  
 
1 The solicitation anticipated a tiered evaluation approach.  The VA sought to award a 
contract to a service- disabled veteran- owned small business (SDVOSB).  However, “[i]f 
no proposals were submitted by SDVOSB concerns, or if none of the proposals would

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423117.3  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 16, RFP at 152.2  
The VA sought shuttle transportation services for VA beneficiaries and employees 
within the VA Maryland healthcare system.  RFP at 175.  The agency anticipated award 
of a fixed- price contract for one base year and four  option years.  Id. at 79.  
 
Award was to be made on a lowest -priced, technically acceptable ( LPTA)  basis, 
considering the following evaluation factors:   technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  
at 151.  The technical factor was comprised of four subfactors:  (1) large scale shuttle 
transportation experience; (2) company stability/longevity; (3) company safety record/program; and (4) personnel.  Id.   
 The VA initially  made award to Taylor Made on October 9, 2024, which resulted in a 
protest to our Office filed by RTW Management, an unsuccessful offeror .  Memorandum 
of Law (MOL)  at 3; COS at 1.  RTW challenged the acceptability of Taylor Made’ s 
proposal .  AR, Exh. 6 , First RTW Protest .  In response, the agency notified our Office of 
its intent to take corrective action by reevaluating Taylor Made’s proposal.  MOL at 4.  Relevant here, the agency did not terminate the contract to Taylor Made but suspended 
performance pending completion of the reevaluation.  As a result of the agency’s 
proposed corrective action, we dismissed that protest as academic on November 20, 
2024.  RTW Management , B-423117.1, Nov. 20, 2024 (unpublished decision).   
 On November 27, the VA reevaluated Taylor Made’s proposal and found it, again, to be 
technically acceptable.  MOL at 4; AR, Exh. 2, Revised Source Selection Decision 
(SSD) at 3.  That award decision resulted in a second protest by RTW.  AR, Exh. 8, 
Second RTW Protest; MOL at 4.  On January 24, 2025, the VA notified our Office that it 
intended to take corrective action in response to the second protest.  MOL at 5.  The VA 
explained that as a result of GAO’s request for additional information following 
submis sion of the agency report, the contracting officer reevaluated Taylor Made’s 
proposal and found that the proposal did not, in fact, meet the RFP’s requirements and was, therefore, technically unacceptable.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s 
Reevaluation D etermination at 1; MOL at 5.  Based on this finding, the VA advised that 
it would take corrective action by terminating Taylor Made’s contract and evaluating the proposal of the next lowest -priced offeror (RTW) to determine whether that proposal 
 
result in award at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government, 
then the SDVOSB set -aside will be withdrawn and the agency will review quotes from 
the next tier.”  RFP at 151.  The agency then sought to prioritize proposals submitt ed by 
veteran- owned small businesses (VOSBs).  If no proposals were submitted by VOSBs, 
or if none of the proposals would result in award at a fair and reasonable price, then the agency would review proposals from small businesses.  Id.  Within the small business 
tier, preference was given to Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone)  small 
business concerns and 8(a) participants.  Id.

(unpublished decision)  at 1.  As a result, w e dismissed the  protest as academic.  Id. 
 
On February 13, the VA notified Taylor Made that its contract would be terminated because the firm’s proposal had  been deemed technically unacceptable upon 
reevaluation.  AR, Exh. 11; Termination for Convenience.  Taylor Made, subsequently, 
filed th is protest with our Office on February 24.  
 DISCUSSION  
 Taylor Made argues that the VA improperly found the protester’s proposal to be technically unacceptable, and thus, the VA’s termination of Taylor Made’s contract was improper.  Protest at 4- 7.  The protester also argues that any subsequent award to RTW 
is unreasonable because RTW, itself, does not meet the solicitation requirements.  Id. 
at 8.  The agency responds that the contracting officer erred in initially finding Taylor 
Made’s proposal technically acceptable, that the protester was improperly awarded the contract, and as such, termination of the protester’s contract was warranted.  MOL at 7.  Although we do not specifically address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester’s arguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest.
3 
 As an initial matter, our Office generally will not review the termination of contracts because such actions are matters of contract administration that fall outside of GAO’s bid protest jurisdiction.  4 C.F.R. §  21.5(a); Phenix Rsch. Prods. , B-292184.2, A ug. 8, 
2003, 2003 CPD ¶  151 at 3.  Our Office will, however, consider the termination of a 
contract where the agency’s decision to terminate the contract flows from a defect the contracting agency perceived in the award process.  Optimum Servs., Inc ., B-401051, 
Apr. 1 5, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶  85 at 2.  Here, there is no dispute between the parties that 
the agency’s decision to terminate Taylor Made’s award for convenience arose from an alleged defect in the VA’s evaluation process.  See  MOL at 6 -7; Protest at 1- 2.  In cases 
 
3 For example, the protester argues that RTW’s second protest was untimely, and “the 
VA’s decision to terminate the Contract for convenience is based on an improperly considered protest and should be retracted for that reason alone.”  Protest at 8.  The agency substantively responded to this allegation in the agency report .  MOL at 8 n.2.  
The protester neither refuted the agency’s response nor did it pursue this allegation in its comments to the agency report.  See  Comments.  W here, as here,  an agency 
provides a detailed response to a protester ’s assertions and the protester fails to rebut 
or otherwise substantively address the agency ’s arguments in its comments, the 
protester provides us with no basis to conclude that the agency ’s position with respect 
to the issue in question is unreasonable or improper.   4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); C2C 
Innovative Sols., Inc ., B-416289, B -416289.2, July 30, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 269 at 6.   As 
such, we consider this allegation to be abandoned and do not discuss it further.  DigiFlight, Inc. , B-419590, B -419590.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  206 at 4.   
  Page 4 B-423117.3  such as these, we will examine the award procedures that underlie the termination 
action for the limited purpose of determining whether the initial award was improper, and, if so, whether the corrective action taken is proper.  Phenix Rsch. Prods. , supra.  
We will not object to an agency’s proposed corrective action where the agency concludes that the award, because of perceived flaws in the procurement process, was not necessarily made on the basis most advantageous to the government, so long as the corr ective action taken is appropriate to remedy the impropriety.

Inc., B-285150.2, July 6, 2000, 2000 CPD ¶  115 at 3.    
 Prior Experience  
 Taylor Made primarily contends that the agency unreasonably found the protester’s proposal to be technically unacceptable.  Protest at 5- 7.  The VA responds, explaining 
that the protester’s proposal was found to be technically unacceptable, in part, becaus e 
Taylor Made’s prior experience references were not completed within five years of solicitation issuance.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s Reevaluation Determination at 1.  The protester argues that the solicitation did not require all prior experience 
references to be completed within five years of the issuance of the RFP.  Protest at 6.   
 Relevant here, the RFP’s first technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation experience) required the following:  
 
The Offeror shall demonstrate proof of experience as the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract.  Included in these routes[,] specific criteria need to be submitted as proof of 
experience:  
 
• Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a continuous basis along 
a designated route 
• Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis  
• Proof of operating at least two concurrent shuttle routes having a minimum passenger capacity of 18 or greater.  
• Proof of operating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-
ambulatory access equipment  
 RFP at 152.  Additionally, offerors were asked to provide the “[l]ocation and brief description of the work[,] including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting method within the last five (5) years.”   Id.   
 Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references  with its proposal, one performed 
for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , and one performed for the 
VA.  AR, Exh. 7, Protester’s Proposal at 20.  Taylor made does not challenge the 
agency’s conclusion that the CMS contract  did not meet all route requirements listed in 
the RFP.  MOL at 9 n. 3; see generally Protest .  Instead, the gravamen of the 
protester’s arguments focuses on challenging the agency’s determination that the VA contract reference did not meet the requirements of the technic al subfactor.   Page 5 B-423117.3   
As noted above, in reevaluating the protester’s proposal, the contracting officer determined that the protester had failed to meet the solicitation’s prior experience requirements, as Taylor Made’s “[t]echnical proposal did not provide the location and brief description of the work including the building use and contracting method within the 
last five (5) years . . . in its proposal to demonstrate its large- scale shuttle transportation 
experience.”  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s Reevaluation Determinat ion at 1; see 
RFP at 152.  We address, first, the protester’s challenge to the requirement that the submitted prior experience be performed within the last five years.  
  Mandatory Language  
 In arguing that its proposal met the solicitation’s prior experience requirements --and 
thus was not technically unacceptable--Taylor Made contends that the agency’s interpretation of the solicitation is unreasonable.  In this regard, the protester makes a multi -prong challenge.  First, Taylor Made argues that the solicitation did not “mandate 
that all experience must be limited to the past 5 years” because the RFP did not use the “type of mandatory language [like] ‘must’ in limiting the types of experience that could be considered under Subfactor 1.”  Protest at 6.  We find this contention to be without merit because the protester conveniently disregards the word “shall” in the subfactor’s requirement.  See RFP at 152 (“The Offeror shall  demonstrate proof of experience as 
the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes . .  .”) (emphasis added).  As our decisions have explained, the use of the term “shall” is mandatory, and not permissive in nature.  Arora Grp., Inc., B -288127, Sept. 14, 2001, 2001 CPD ¶  154 
at 6; Aldevra , B-406205, Mar. 14, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  112 at 5.  As such, the solicitation 
expressly mandated that an offeror submit a prior experience reference that met the solicitation requirements, provide the location and brief description of work for that experience, and that the reference be completed within the last five years.  
  Reasonable Interpretation 
 Next, the protester argues that the only reasonable interpretation of the term “within t he 
last five (5) years ” is that some-- rather than all --referenced projects needed to be 
completed within five years of the issuance of the solicitation.  Protest at 6 (“The only 
reasonable interpretation is just that a bidder must provide some information to satisfy 
Section 1.1.  A reasonable bidder would not understand this to be a blanket, 5- year 
cutoff of experience . . .”).  Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation ’s actual 
requirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.   Sikorsky 
Aircraft Corp., B -416027, B -416027.2, May 22, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶  177 at 11.   When  a 
protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretati on must be 
consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.   PAE 
Aviation & Tech. Servs., LLC , B-418828.3, Mar. 17, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  153 at 9.    
  Page 6 B-423117.3  Here, we find the agency ’s interpretation of the solicitation reasonable, and the 
protester ’s interpretation not reasonable.  The RFP stated:  “ Provide location and brief 
description of the work including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting 
method within the last five (5) years. ”  RFP at 152.  The solicitation clearly advised 
offerors that they should provide the location and description of work for the experience references submitted.  Id. at 152.  The only reasonable reading of this l anguage is that 
the agency intended offerors to submit those location and work descriptions for each reference submitted.  Further, we find that the only reasonable reading of the phrase “within the last five (5) years ,” is that the phrase modifies what comes before it in the 
sentence.  See Kevcon, Inc. , B-406024.3,  June 18, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  221 at 6- 7 
(finding that term at end of sentence modified the whole sentence).  As such, we find 
that the provision is most reasonably read as requiring an offeror to s ubmit references, 
each performed within the last five years, that detailed the location of performance and a description of the work performed.  
 When read as a whole, it is clear from the requirements of this technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation services) that the agency wanted offerors to demonstrate prior experience that was both relevant and recent.  With respect to relevance,  the 
subfactor required offerors to demonstrate experience performing “as the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract,” that met the specified criteria ( e.g., “operating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-
ambulatory access equipment” ).  RFP at 152.  For recency, the subfactor required 
relevant prior experience to have been performed “within the last five (5) years.”  Id.  
Under the protester’s interpretation, offerors would be able to meet the subfactor’s requirement by submitting one experience reference that was relevant --i.e., met the 
listed criteria such as “operating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis” --and another 
experience reference that met the recency requirement of being within five years.  Ev en 
if we agreed with the protester’s interpretation--which we do not --this interpretation 
would require giving no effect to the requirement that the demonstrated experience be “on a single contract.”  RFP at 152.  Accordingly, we find the protester’s inter pretation to 
be unreasonable when the solicitation is read as a whole and giving effect to the plain language of the provision.  PAE Aviation & Tech. Servs., LLC, supra at 9-10. 
  Well- Written Proposal  
 Finally, the protester argues that its proposal  did, in fact, demonstrate that performance 
was completed within the 5 -year timeframe .  Taylor Made alleges that there had been 
modifications and extensions made to contracts it held with the VA for transportation services, and as result, performance had been extended beyond March of 2019.  Protest  at 5-6. 
 Here, the VA issued the solicitation on May 14, 2025.  COS at 1.  As such, any prior experience references submitted by offerors were required to be completed after May 14, 2019, to be considered completed “within the last five (5) years.”  The only 
inform ation Taylor Made presented in its proposal, however, demonstrates the last 
possible date of completion of its VA shuttle transportation contract was March of 2019.   Page 7 B-423117.3  See AR, Exh. 7, Protester’s Proposal at 20.  Specifically, Taylor Made’s proposal clearly 
states that “Contract End” for the VA contract was “03/2019.”4  Id.  Further, none of the 
contract numbers associated with performance of the VA contract that were explicitly 
identified in the proposal indicated that performance extended beyond March of 2019.  Id. at 17; MOL at 11.  While the protester also cites to multiple examples of contract 
extensions in its protest, the record demonstrates that such references were not 
included in Taylor Made’s proposal, nor did those references pertain to the protester’s 
shuttle transportation experience.  MOL at  11 (noting, among others, that modification of 
contract cited in protest pertained to the provision of sedan services, rather than shuttle transportation services, and was not evaluated by contracting officer because reference 
was not included in protester’s proposal).   
 
In reviewing protests of alleged evaluations and source selections, our Office examines 
the record to determine whether the agency judgment was reasonable and in accord with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws.  T -C Transcription, 
Inc., B-401470.2, Feb. 16, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 50 at 4.  It is an offeror ’s responsibility to 
submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly 
demonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by t he 
procuring agency.  In this regard, an offeror must affirmatively demonstrate the merits of its proposal, which is at risk of rejection if the offeror fails to do so.  Id.    
 On the record before us, we find nothing on the face of the protester’s proposal informed the agency that the listed VA contracts were performed within five years of 
solicitation issuance.  Agencies are not required to consider outside information when evaluating an offeror’s technical approach.  Johnson Controls Sec. Sols. , B-418489.3,

Therefore, we fi nd unobjectionable the agency’s determination that the protester’s 
proposal was technically unacceptable because Taylor Made failed to demonstrate that 
its prior experience references met the requirements of the technical subfactor.  As such, the agency was reasonable in terminating the contract that was initially awarded to Taylor Made, because an unacceptable proposal cannot form the basis for award.

4 Although Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references (CMS and VA) to 
meet the first technical subfactor requirements, the protester listed several contract numbers as part of its VA experience reference.  AR, Exh. 7, Protester’s Proposal at 17.  
5 The protester also challenges the agency’s finding that Taylor Made’s proposal “did 
not provide proof of operating at least two concurrent shuttle routes  having a minimum 
passenger capacity of 18 or greater .”  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s Reevaluation

will not sustain a protest  where the record does not demonstrate that the protester 
would have had a reasonable chance of receiving award but for the agency ’s actions.

RTW’s Proposal  
 
Taylor Made also challenges the agency’s evaluation of RTW’s technical proposal.  
Protest at 8.  The agency explains, however, that award has yet to be made for the current requirement.  MOL at 8 n.2 (“[T]he reevaluation contemplated in the corrective action is still ongoing.”); COS at 2 (“The evaluators and I have not completed our 
evaluations of RTW Management’s proposal to determine whether it meets all of the RFP’s technical acceptability standards.”).  We view Taylor Made’s assertions of improper evaluation of another offeror’s proposal as premature, given that an award decision has not yet been made.  See Quotient, Inc ., B-416473.4, B -416473.5, Mar. 12,

this juncture.  
 The protest is denied.

reasonableness of the agency’s evaluation that found Taylor Made’s proposal to be technically unacceptable--and therefore ineligible for award--we conclude that the asserted evaluation error regarding shuttle passenger capacity  presents no reasonable

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging the agency’s termination of protester’s awarded contract is denied where, upon reevaluation, the agency reasonably found the protester’s proposal to be technically unacceptable.  
DECISION  
 Taylor Made Transportation Services, Inc., a small business of Baltimore, Maryland, protests the reevaluation of its proposal, its elimination from competition, and the termination of its award for the convenience of the government under request for propos als (RFP) No.  36C24524R0044, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) for van shuttle transportation services.  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably reevaluated its proposal as technically unacceptable, and thus, the agency’s decision to terminate the protester’s contract for convenience was improper.  
 We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the solicitation on May 14, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, as a small business set -aside.
1  
 
1 The solicitation anticipated a tiered evaluation approach.  The VA sought to award a 
contract to a service- disabled veteran- owned small business (SDVOSB).  However, “[i]f 
no proposals were submitted by SDVOSB concerns, or if none of the proposals would

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423117.3  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 16, RFP at 152.2  
The VA sought shuttle transportation services for VA beneficiaries and employees 
within the VA Maryland healthcare system.  RFP at 175.  The agency anticipated award 
of a fixed- price contract for one base year and four  option years.  Id. at 79.  
 
Award was to be made on a lowest -priced, technically acceptable ( LPTA)  basis, 
considering the following evaluation factors:   technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  
at 151.  The technical factor was comprised of four subfactors:  (1) large scale shuttle 
transportation experience; (2) company stability/longevity; (3) company safety record/program; and (4) personnel.  Id.   
 The VA initially  made award to Taylor Made on October 9, 2024, which resulted in a 
protest to our Office filed by RTW Management, an unsuccessful offeror .  Memorandum 
of Law (MOL)  at 3; COS at 1.  RTW challenged the acceptability of Taylor Made’ s 
proposal .  AR, Exh. 6 , First RTW Protest .  In response, the agency notified our Office of 
its intent to take corrective action by reevaluating Taylor Made’s proposal.  MOL at 4.  Relevant here, the agency did not terminate the contract to Taylor Made but suspended 
performance pending completion of the reevaluation.  As a result of the agency’s 
proposed corrective action, we dismissed that protest as academic on November 20, 
2024.  RTW Management , B-423117.1, Nov. 20, 2024 (unpublished decision).   
 On November 27, the VA reevaluated Taylor Made’s proposal and found it, again, to be 
technically acceptable.  MOL at 4; AR, Exh. 2, Revised Source Selection Decision 
(SSD) at 3.  That award decision resulted in a second protest by RTW.  AR, Exh. 8, 
Second RTW Protest; MOL at 4.  On January 24, 2025, the VA notified our Office that it 
intended to take corrective action in response to the second protest.  MOL at 5.  The VA 
explained that as a result of GAO’s request for additional information following 
submis sion of the agency report, the contracting officer reevaluated Taylor Made’s 
proposal and found that the proposal did not, in fact, meet the RFP’s requirements and was, therefore, technically unacceptable.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s 
Reevaluation D etermination at 1; MOL at 5.  Based on this finding, the VA advised that 
it would take corrective action by terminating Taylor Made’s contract and evaluating the proposal of the next lowest -priced offeror (RTW) to determine whether that proposal 
 
result in award at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government, 
then the SDVOSB set -aside will be withdrawn and the agency will review quotes from 
the next tier.”  RFP at 151.  The agency then sought to prioritize proposals submitt ed by 
veteran- owned small businesses (VOSBs).  If no proposals were submitted by VOSBs, 
or if none of the proposals would result in award at a fair and reasonable price, then the agency would review proposals from small businesses.  Id.  Within the small business 
tier, preference was given to Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone)  small 
business concerns and 8(a) participants.  Id.

(unpublished decision)  at 1.  As a result, w e dismissed the  protest as academic.  Id. 
 
On February 13, the VA notified Taylor Made that its contract would be terminated because the firm’s proposal had  been deemed technically unacceptable upon 
reevaluation.  AR, Exh. 11; Termination for Convenience.  Taylor Made, subsequently, 
filed th is protest with our Office on February 24.  
 DISCUSSION  
 Taylor Made argues that the VA improperly found the protester’s proposal to be technically unacceptable, and thus, the VA’s termination of Taylor Made’s contract was improper.  Protest at 4- 7.  The protester also argues that any subsequent award to RTW 
is unreasonable because RTW, itself, does not meet the solicitation requirements.  Id. 
at 8.  The agency responds that the contracting officer erred in initially finding Taylor 
Made’s proposal technically acceptable, that the protester was improperly awarded the contract, and as such, termination of the protester’s contract was warranted.  MOL at 7.  Although we do not specifically address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester’s arguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest.
3 
 As an initial matter, our Office generally will not review the termination of contracts because such actions are matters of contract administration that fall outside of GAO’s bid protest jurisdiction.  4 C.F.R. §  21.5(a); Phenix Rsch. Prods. , B-292184.2, A ug. 8, 
2003, 2003 CPD ¶  151 at 3.  Our Office will, however, consider the termination of a 
contract where the agency’s decision to terminate the contract flows from a defect the contracting agency perceived in the award process.  Optimum Servs., Inc ., B-401051, 
Apr. 1 5, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶  85 at 2.  Here, there is no dispute between the parties that 
the agency’s decision to terminate Taylor Made’s award for convenience arose from an alleged defect in the VA’s evaluation process.  See  MOL at 6 -7; Protest at 1- 2.  In cases 
 
3 For example, the protester argues that RTW’s second protest was untimely, and “the 
VA’s decision to terminate the Contract for convenience is based on an improperly considered protest and should be retracted for that reason alone.”  Protest at 8.  The agency substantively responded to this allegation in the agency report .  MOL at 8 n.2.  
The protester neither refuted the agency’s response nor did it pursue this allegation in its comments to the agency report.  See  Comments.  W here, as here,  an agency 
provides a detailed response to a protester ’s assertions and the protester fails to rebut 
or otherwise substantively address the agency ’s arguments in its comments, the 
protester provides us with no basis to conclude that the agency ’s position with respect 
to the issue in question is unreasonable or improper.   4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); C2C 
Innovative Sols., Inc ., B-416289, B -416289.2, July 30, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 269 at 6.   As 
such, we consider this allegation to be abandoned and do not discuss it further.  DigiFlight, Inc. , B-419590, B -419590.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  206 at 4.   
  Page 4 B-423117.3  such as these, we will examine the award procedures that underlie the termination 
action for the limited purpose of determining whether the initial award was improper, and, if so, whether the corrective action taken is proper.  Phenix Rsch. Prods. , supra.  
We will not object to an agency’s proposed corrective action where the agency concludes that the award, because of perceived flaws in the procurement process, was not necessarily made on the basis most advantageous to the government, so long as the corr ective action taken is appropriate to remedy the impropriety.

Inc., B-285150.2, July 6, 2000, 2000 CPD ¶  115 at 3.    
 Prior Experience  
 Taylor Made primarily contends that the agency unreasonably found the protester’s proposal to be technically unacceptable.  Protest at 5- 7.  The VA responds, explaining 
that the protester’s proposal was found to be technically unacceptable, in part, becaus e 
Taylor Made’s prior experience references were not completed within five years of solicitation issuance.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s Reevaluation Determination at 1.  The protester argues that the solicitation did not require all prior experience 
references to be completed within five years of the issuance of the RFP.  Protest at 6.   
 Relevant here, the RFP’s first technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation experience) required the following:  
 
The Offeror shall demonstrate proof of experience as the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract.  Included in these routes[,] specific criteria need to be submitted as proof of 
experience:  
 
• Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a continuous basis along 
a designated route 
• Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis  
• Proof of operating at least two concurrent shuttle routes having a minimum passenger capacity of 18 or greater.  
• Proof of operating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-
ambulatory access equipment  
 RFP at 152.  Additionally, offerors were asked to provide the “[l]ocation and brief description of the work[,] including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting method within the last five (5) years.”   Id.   
 Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references  with its proposal, one performed 
for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , and one performed for the 
VA.  AR, Exh. 7, Protester’s Proposal at 20.  Taylor made does not challenge the 
agency’s conclusion that the CMS contract  did not meet all route requirements listed in 
the RFP.  MOL at 9 n. 3; see generally Protest .  Instead, the gravamen of the 
protester’s arguments focuses on challenging the agency’s determination that the VA contract reference did not meet the requirements of the technic al subfactor.   Page 5 B-423117.3   
As noted above, in reevaluating the protester’s proposal, the contracting officer determined that the protester had failed to meet the solicitation’s prior experience requirements, as Taylor Made’s “[t]echnical proposal did not provide the location and brief description of the work including the building use and contracting method within the 
last five (5) years . . . in its proposal to demonstrate its large- scale shuttle transportation 
experience.”  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s Reevaluation Determinat ion at 1; see 
RFP at 152.  We address, first, the protester’s challenge to the requirement that the submitted prior experience be performed within the last five years.  
  Mandatory Language  
 In arguing that its proposal met the solicitation’s prior experience requirements --and 
thus was not technically unacceptable--Taylor Made contends that the agency’s interpretation of the solicitation is unreasonable.  In this regard, the protester makes a multi -prong challenge.  First, Taylor Made argues that the solicitation did not “mandate 
that all experience must be limited to the past 5 years” because the RFP did not use the “type of mandatory language [like] ‘must’ in limiting the types of experience that could be considered under Subfactor 1.”  Protest at 6.  We find this contention to be without merit because the protester conveniently disregards the word “shall” in the subfactor’s requirement.  See RFP at 152 (“The Offeror shall  demonstrate proof of experience as 
the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes . .  .”) (emphasis added).  As our decisions have explained, the use of the term “shall” is mandatory, and not permissive in nature.  Arora Grp., Inc., B -288127, Sept. 14, 2001, 2001 CPD ¶  154 
at 6; Aldevra , B-406205, Mar. 14, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  112 at 5.  As such, the solicitation 
expressly mandated that an offeror submit a prior experience reference that met the solicitation requirements, provide the location and brief description of work for that experience, and that the reference be completed within the last five years.  
  Reasonable Interpretation 
 Next, the protester argues that the only reasonable interpretation of the term “within t he 
last five (5) years ” is that some-- rather than all --referenced projects needed to be 
completed within five years of the issuance of the solicitation.  Protest at 6 (“The only 
reasonable interpretation is just that a bidder must provide some information to satisfy 
Section 1.1.  A reasonable bidder would not understand this to be a blanket, 5- year 
cutoff of experience . . .”).  Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation ’s actual 
requirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.   Sikorsky

protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretati on must be 
consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.   PAE

  Page 6 B-423117.3  Here, we find the agency ’s interpretation of the solicitation reasonable, and the 
protester ’s interpretation not reasonable.  The RFP stated:  “ Provide location and brief 
description of the work including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting 
method within the last five (5) years. ”  RFP at 152.  The solicitation clearly advised 
offerors that they should provide the location and description of work for the experience references submitted.  Id. at 152.  The only reasonable reading of this l anguage is that 
the agency intended offerors to submit those location and work descriptions for each reference submitted.  Further, we find that the only reasonable reading of the phrase “within the last five (5) years ,” is that the phrase modifies what comes before it in the 
sentence.  See Kevcon, Inc. , B-406024.3,  June 18, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  221 at 6- 7 
(finding that term at end of sentence modified the whole sentence).  As such, we find 
that the provision is most reasonably read as requiring an offeror to s ubmit references, 
each performed within the last five years, that detailed the location of performance and a description of the work performed.  
 When read as a whole, it is clear from the requirements of this technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation services) that the agency wanted offerors to demonstrate prior experience that was both relevant and recent.  With respect to relevance,  the 
subfactor required offerors to demonstrate experience performing “as the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract,” that met the specified criteria ( e.g., “operating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-

if we agreed with the protester’s interpretation--which we do not --this interpretation 
would require giving no effect to the requirement that the demonstrated experience be “on a single contract.”  RFP at 152.  Accordingly, we find the protester’s inter pretation to 
be unreasonable when the solicitation is read as a whole and giving effect to the plain language of the provision.  PAE Aviation & Tech. Servs., LLC, supra at 9-10. 
  Well- Written Proposal  
 Finally, the protester argues that its proposal  did, in fact, demonstrate that performance 
was completed within the 5 -year timeframe .  Taylor Made alleges that there had been 
modifications and extensions made to contracts it held with the VA for transportation services, and as result, performance had been extended beyond March of 2019.  Protest  at 5-6. 
 Here, the VA issued the solicitation on May 14, 2025.  COS at 1.  As such, any prior experience references submitted by offerors were required to be completed after May 14, 2019, to be considered completed “within the last five (5) years.”  The only 
inform ation Taylor Made presented in its proposal, however, demonstrates the last 
possible date of completion of its VA shuttle transportation contract was March of 2019.   Page 7 B-423117.3  See AR, Exh. 7, Protester’s Proposal at 20.  Specifically, Taylor Made’s proposal clearly 
states that “Contract End” for the VA contract was “03/2019.”4  Id.  Further, none of the 
contract numbers associated with performance of the VA contract that were explicitly 
identified in the proposal indicated that performance extended beyond March of 2019.  Id. at 17; MOL at 11.  While the protester also cites to multiple examples of contract 
extensions in its protest, the record demonstrates that such references were not 
included in Taylor Made’s proposal, nor did those references pertain to the protester’s 
shuttle transportation experience.  MOL at  11 (noting, among others, that modification of 
contract cited in protest pertained to the provision of sedan services, rather than shuttle transportation services, and was not evaluated by contracting officer because reference 
was not included in protester’s proposal).   
 
In reviewing protests of alleged evaluations and source selections, our Office examines 
the record to determine whether the agency judgment was reasonable and in accord with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws.  T -C Transcription, 
Inc., B-401470.2, Feb. 16, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 50 at 4.  It is an offeror ’s responsibility to 
submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly 
demonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by t he 
procuring agency.  In this regard, an offeror must affirmatively demonstrate the merits of its proposal, which is at risk of rejection if the offeror fails to do so.  Id.    
 On the record before us, we find nothing on the face of the protester’s proposal informed the agency that the listed VA contracts were performed within five years of 
solicitation issuance.  Agencies are not required to consider outside information when evaluating an offeror’s technical approach.  Johnson Controls Sec. Sols. , B-418489.3,

Therefore, we fi nd unobjectionable the agency’s determination that the protester’s 
proposal was technically unacceptable because Taylor Made failed to demonstrate that 
its prior experience references met the requirements of the technical subfactor.  As such, the agency was reasonable in terminating the contract that was initially awarded to Taylor Made, because an unacceptable proposal cannot form the basis for award.

meet the first technical subfactor requirements, the protester listed several contract numbers as part of its VA experience reference.  AR, Exh. 7, Protester’s Proposal at 17.

not provide proof of operating at least two concurrent shuttle routes  having a minimum 
passenger capacity of 18 or greater .”  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer’s Reevaluation

evaluations of RTW Management’s proposal to determine whether it meets all of the RFP’s technical acceptability standards.”).

reasonableness of the agency’s evaluation that found Taylor Made’s proposal to be technically unacceptable--and therefore ineligible for award--we conclude that the asserted evaluation error regarding shuttle passenger capacity  presents no reasonable

DECISION  
 SCOR2E,
1 of Herndon, Virginia, protests the establishment of a blanket purchase 
agreement (BPA) with The Cadmus Group, LLC, of Waltham, Massachusetts, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 70FB8024Q00000008, issued by the Department of 
Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), for technical 
assistance.  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated its

Virginia, and Guidehouse, Inc., of McLean, Virginia.  Protest at 17.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423315; B-423315.2  quotation, improperly conducted a price realism analysis, and made a flawed best -value 
determination.   
 
We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the RFQ on August 19, 2024, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 8.405- 2, to vendors holding contracts under General Services 
Administration multiple award schedule special item number (SIN) 541611 management and financial consulting, acquisition and grants management support, and business program and project management services.  Agency Report (AR), Tab C, RFQ amend. 0005 at 1; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 3.  FEMA issued the RFQ to obtain technical assista nce with response, recovery, and other disaster operations missions 
under the Office of Response and Recovery (ORR).  AR, Tab D, Statement of Work (SOW) at 2; Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3.  The ORR provides guidance and oversight for the coordination and delivery of support to those suffering from natural disasters and other emergencies.  FEMA, Office of Response and Recovery, https://www.fema.gov/about/offices/ response- recovery  (last visited May 9, 2025).  
Technical assistance is needed to help ORR personnel guide and oversee the response to these disasters.  COS at 1.           The BPA would be established with the vendor offering the best value to the government considering the following factors listed in descending order of importance:  technical and management approach (factor 1); capability of proposed key personnel 
and staff ing plan (factor 2); past performance (factor 3); price (factor 4); and 
subcontracting plan (factor 5).  RFQ at 5, 13.  As relevant here, the technical and management approach factor had two subfactors:  concept paper and demonstrated prior experience.  Id . at 5. 
 Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, vendors were to explain their experience by addressing 11 topic areas.  RFQ at 7.  For each topic area, vendors were to provide one recent and relevant example of prior experience.  Id .  These examples 
were to demonstrate experience with the corresponding statement of work (SOW) requirements as well.  Id.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the references 
vendors provided for each topic area and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id. at 8. Under the technical and management approach factor the agency 
would assign a rating of high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.
2  Id. 
at 10.   
 
2 As described herein, during the evaluation process, the agency also assigned a rating 
of high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence to quotations under each technical subfactor.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation 
at 1 (referring to the Adobe PDF pagination); AR, Tab G, Award Decision Memorandum (ADM) at 3; AR, Tab H, Post -Award Notice at 1.    Page 3 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency received quotations from seven vendors.  COS at 3.  The evaluation results 
for SCOR2E and Cadmus were as follows:  
 
 SCOR2E  Cadmus

Management Approach:  Some  High 
      Concept  Paper        High High

 AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 7.  
 Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the technical evaluation team (TET) noted the qualities of SCOR2E’s quotation that raised or lowered its expectation that SCOR2E would successfully perform the contract.  Regarding topic areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10, the TET concluded that SCOR2E provided recent and relevant examples of its prior experience and demonstrated complete knowledge and understanding of the requirements.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2- 4.  
Regarding topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11, the TET concluded that SCOR2E’s quotation did 
not do so.  Id. at 2 -3.  The TET concluded that, overall, it had some confidence in 
SCOR2E’s ability to perform the contract based on its demonstrated prior experience.  Id. at 1.  Under the technical and management approach, SCOR2E’s quotation 
ultimately received a rating of some confidence.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.
3   
 After evaluations were completed, the SSA determined that SCOR2E’s quotation was the second- highest rated after the quotation submitted by Cadmus.  AR, Tab G, ADM 
at 16.  Both vendors’ prices were determined to be reasonable.  Id . at 7.   
 In comparing the quotations, the SSA noted that SCOR2E’s failure to adequately address all the topic areas under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor gave the 
agency only some confidence in its ability to perform the work required.  The SSA noted 
 
3 Neither the TET’s evaluation of SCOR2E’s quotation under subfactor 2, nor the source 
selection authority’s (SSA) decision in the ADM stated that SCOR2E, or any other 
vendor, received an “overall” technical rating.  However, the SSA wrote that Cadmus “is the only offeror who received high confidence ratings for Factor 1 and Factor 2,” 
implying that the agency had only some confidence in SCOR2E’s quotation under the technical factor overall.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.  This is consistent with how the parties have referred to SCOR2E’s subfactor 2 rating and FEMA’s impression of SCOR2E’s 
technical approach overall during these proceedings.    Page 4 B-423315; B-423315.2  that, while SCOR2E understood the requirements and proposed a sound approach for 
most of the topic areas, it did not provide experience that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements for topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Id. at 9.  Conversely, 
the agency noted that Cadmus demonstrated a thorough understanding of the requirements and successfully addressed all topic areas.  Id. at 10.  The SSA further 
noted that Cadmus’s superior experience gave the agency significantly more confidence in its ability to perform which merited its price premium.  Id.  The SSA determined that 
Cadmus provided the best value to the agency and made award to it on January 27, 2025.  COS at 7.  SCOR2E was notified the same day and this protest followed.   
 DISCUSSION  SCOR2E raises several challenges to the agency’s evaluation of quotations and asserts that the best -value determination is flawed.  We have considered all of SCOR2E’s 
arguments and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to federal supply schedule 
vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition, we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation.  Nittany Bus. Movers, Inc., B -411856, Oct. 27, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 327 at 1-
2.  A protester ’s disagreement with the agency ’s evaluation, without more, is not 
sufficient to sustain the protest.  Id. 
 Demonstrated Prior Experience  
 SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation under the 
demonstrated prior experience subfactor.  Specifically, SCOR2E challenges the agency’s findings under topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Protest at 8- 12.  SCOR2E asserts 
that had it not been for these alleged errors, it would have received a technical rating equal with that of Cadmus and would have likely received award because of its lower price.  Id . at 12.  We have reviewed all SCOR2E’s arguments and find that it has not 
demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable regarding any of the topic areas.  We address several examples below.   Again, under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the RFQ required vendors to provide one example of prior experience for each of the 11 topic areas, demonstrating their understanding of the corresponding SOW requirements.  RFQ at 7.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the vendors’ references and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id . at 8.   
 As a first example, topic area 3 required prior experience with “tangible results in Product Rollout Plan and Socialization Strategy Development.”  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.3 of the SOW –  support for product rollout plan and socialization strategy 
development – corresponded to this requirement.  Sub paragraph 4.3.1 of the SOW 
required that “The Contractor shall develop rollout plans for products including compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach  Page 5 B-423315; B-423315.2  and communication products, fact sheets and messaging to communicate key 
messages for FEMA programs.”  SOW at ¶ 4.3.1.   
 In its evaluation of SCOR2E’s quotation regarding topic 3, the agency noted the protester’s quotation described creating products such as a guide for the agency, an internal Microsoft SharePoint site, and talking points for meetings and trainings.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  However, the agency 
noted that these examples focused on internal products for the agency, like the guide, as opposed to external products for the public.  Id .  The agency also noted that the 
protester’s quotation did not provide enough information because it did not demonstrate 
experience with rollout plans for products such as video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, and outreach and communication products.  Id .  The 
agency’s findings regarding this topic contributed to the SSA’s determination that it had some confidence in SCOR2E’s prior experience.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 9, 15.    
 SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation regarding topic area 3 for several reasons.  The protester asserts that its quotation demonstrated experience with product rollout plans, and points to the portion of its quotation wherein it 
describes its experience developing, releasing, and rolling out an internal FEMA guide –  
“A Guide to Community Engagement.”  Protest at 8- 9; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  
Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.  The protester next asserts that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  According to the protester, the evaluation implies that SCOR2E was supposed to provide a rollout plan for each type of media listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, which was not required.  Protest at 8; Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.
4   
 
4 The protester argues that the requirements in SOW ¶ 4.3.1 are performance 
requirements rather than evaluation criteria.  According to SCOR2E, this is made clear by the SOW’s  reference to the “ Contractor ” as opposed to the vendor.  SOW at ¶ 4.3.1.   
SCOR2E asserts that because the SOW sets forth requirements that must be met during contract performance, it was improper for FEMA to evaluate its quotation for compliance with the SOW requirements.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.  This argument is without merit because the solicitation made clear that the agency would evaluate quotations based on how they demonstrated experience with the SOW requirements.  The RFQ stated several times that each of the 11 topic areas corresponded to requirements in the SO W.  RFQ at 7 -8.  The instructions for quotation 
submissions for subfactor 2 stated in part that a vendor “shall demonstrate in the submission that it has recent and relevant demonstrated prior experience supporting the scope and complexity of requirements identified in the Statement of Work.”  Id. at 7.  
The RFQ also stated that the evaluation of subfactor 2 “is based on how well the demonstrated prior experience presented by the Offeror aligns with the eleven (11) topics listed above, which are all requirements listed in the SOW .”  Id. at 8 (emphasis 
added).  See MSN Servs., LLC,   B -414900, B -414900.2, et al. , Oct. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD

(continued...)   Page 6 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated SCOR2E’s quotation.  The agency 
first notes that the TET considered the protester’s experience creating and rolling out “A Guide to Community Engagement” for FEMA in its evaluation, as well as the other portions of its quotation that mentioned the creation of an internal SharePoint site and 
conducting meetings and trainings.  MOL at 9- 10; AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  
Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency asserts, however, that despite this prior experience, SCOR2E’s quotation was still insufficient because it did not 
demonstrate experience with a rollout plan that included compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach, or communication as required by the SOW.   MOL at 10.  The agency further asserts that the protester does not 
dispute that its quotation does not demonstrate this experience, but rather only asserts that it was not required to do so.  Id .  The agency argues that the RFQ expressly 
required vendors  to demonstrate their experience with all of the requirements in the 
SOW, like the various types of media listed in paragraph 4.3.1.  Id .   
 Here, we find that SCOR2E has not demonstrated that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  The record shows that the agency considered SCOR2E’s prior experience creating the internal guide, as well as the SharePoint site and the trainings and meetings conducted.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 
Evaluation at 2.  The record also shows that SCOR2E’s quotation does not mention any other types of media, like those listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, and the protester has not asserted that its quotation addresses these other media types.  Id.; AR, Tab E, 
SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.   
 Lastly, the agency’s evaluation does not show that it expected the protester to describe 
a rollout plan for each type of media.  As discussed above, producing rollout plans in general was a requirement of paragraph 4.3.1, but the evaluation criteria requir ed only 
that vendors describe one experience example per topic area.  RFQ at 7.  More to the point, the agency did not in fact find that the protester’s quotation lacked rollout plans, rather; it found that the nature of the experience was limited to supporting internal communication as opposed to external media or communications.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (noting that “The offeror did not 
demonstrate the SOW requirement of ‘compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach & communication products. . . .  Their response focuses more on internal products and the development of a guide as opposed to development of an external media or communications product.”).  The protester does not directly dispute this finding, as a result, this protest ground is denied.  
 As another example, topic area 6 required prior experience with “tangible results in Policy and Procedures Development.”  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.6 of the SOW – policy 
and procedures development –  corresponded to this requirement, which included four 
 
interpret the solicitation’s use of the term “contractor” as indicating performance requirements because the solicitation advised vendors that their quotations needed to address the SOW requirements at issue and the agency would be precluded from evaluating any aspect of a vendor’s technical capability).    Page 7 B-423315; B-423315.2  sub paragraphs.  The sub paragraphs listed several requirements, including that the 
contractor support the development of policies and procedures in several ways:  by collaborating with various stakeholders, supporting the development of associated materia ls in accordance with various formatting guidelines and other requirements, 
supporting the development of the plan of action milestones, and facilitating meetings.  SOW at ¶¶ 4.6.1 -4.6.4.  
 In its evaluation of SCOR2E’s quotation regarding topic area 6, the agency determined that SCOR2E’s quotation “provided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.”  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency then referred to several 
parts of SCOR2E’s quotation supporting this conclusion:  “The offeror mentioned ‘including a policy and procedure review’.  ‘Supported [Field Operations Directorate] in development of the FEMA Strategic Recruitment Plan (SRP) by providing organized, 
structured meetings and activities with actionable outcomes . . .’ (pages three to four).”  Id. 
 SCOR2E asserts that the agency’s evaluation unreasonably ignored information in its quotation.  SCOR2E asserts that its quotation discusses the development of a FEMA policy and procedure and mentioned facilitating meetings.  Protest at 12; AR, Tab E, SCOR2 E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 3- 4.  The agency responds that the 
example cited by SCOR2E was considered by the agency and cited in the evaluation.  The agency also responds that SCOR2E’s quotation does not contain details that the agency failed to consider.  The agency asserts the protester’s argument amounts to nothing other than disagreement with the agency’s judgment that its quotation lacked 
sufficient detail.  MOL at 12.      
 Here, we agree that SCOR2E has failed to show that the evaluation is unreasonable.  As the agency notes, the portions of the quotation SCOR2E claims the agency ignored are specifically cited in the evaluation record as the basis for the agency’s conclusion that SCOR2E’s quotation was too broad.  Compare AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  
Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (the agency states that SCOR2E’s quotation “provided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter,” citing to pages three and four of SCOR2E’s 
quotation) with Protest at 12 (where SCOR2E argues that the agency ignored the 
information on pages three and four of its quotation).  The protester does not cite to any other portions of its quotation to support its claim that its quotation is sufficiently specific.  As a result, the protester’s arguments amount to disagreement with the agency’s 
judgment, as the protester has not shown that the agency’s conclusions were illogical or unsupported by the record, but simply asserts that the portions of its quotation that the agency found to be broad should be read as adequately addressing the requirements.  Int’l Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. , B-419737.3, Dec. 20, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 85 at 6.  
 As another example, topic area 8 required prior experience with “tangible results in Program Analysis, Assessment and Management.”  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.8 of the SOW – support for program analysis, assessment, management and reports –  Page 8 B-423315; B-423315.2  corresponded to this requirement.  This section of the SOW contained 21 subtasks, 
such as implementing ORR programs by analyzing and assessing program data, conducting performance management and analytical studies, and analyzing existing program data and producing reports.  SOW at ¶¶ 4.8.8, 4.8.11- 4.8.14, 4.8.19- 4.8.21.   
 In evaluating SCOR2E’s quotation under topic area 8, the agency found that it did not demonstrate an understanding of program analysis and assessment.  The agency stated that the examples in SCOR2E’s quotation “focused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.”  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 
Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 3.  The agency quoted the following portions of SCOR2E’s quotation as supporting its conclusion:  “ ‘Our team identified trends that were discussed in a Leadership Alignment Session, Future- State Visioning Workshop and Prioritization 
Framework and Workshop with [hazard mitigation assistance] leadership. (3) Guidehouse used its expertise and knowledge of FEMA to develop four guiding 
principles for the hybrid work envi ronment .  . .’ (page five).”  Id. at 3.   
 SCO2E asserts that the agency’s evaluation is unreasonable because there was no requirement in the RFQ or the SOW for “external experience” or “evaluating the success of the program,” and therefore the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Protest at 10- 11; Comments & Supp. Protest at 5.  The protester also argues that even 
if it was required to demonstrate this external -facing experience, it did so, as its 
quotation described experience related to FEMA stakeholders, customers, and local and state government partners.  Protest at 11.   
 The agency responds that it did not apply unstated evaluation criteria and contends that 
the protester’s argument is based on a misreading of the evaluation findings.  The agency explains that its note that SCOR2E’s quotation focused “internally” refers to its 
quotation’s focus on internal processes as opposed to tangible results and did not imply that there was an external experience or focus requirement.  MOL at 14.  The agency further explains that its note regarding “evaluating the success of the program” also referred to SCOR2E’s quotation’s failure to describe the tangible results from its program analysis.  Id .  The agency further responds that the protester has not asserted 
that its quotation demonstrates the success of a program or discusses tangible results, and therefore the protester has not demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  Id .   
 We agree with the agency that the protester has not demonstrated the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  The record shows that the agency’s explanation of the evaluator’s notes is consistent with the evaluator’s notes as stated in the evaluation.   In 
its evaluation the agency cited to the portions of SCOR2E’s quotation that describe a guide produced for internal use by FEMA staff and an internal leadership training, and the agency noted that SCOR2E’s quotation “focused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.”  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 
Evaluation at 3; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 5.  The 
agency’s note that SCOR2E’s quotation “focused internally rather than evaluating the succe ss of the program,” considered with the portions of SCOR2E’s quotation the  Page 9 B-423315; B-423315.2  agency chose to cite, shows that the agency was referring to the protester’s 
demonstration of internal products as opposed to discussing tangible results as asserted by the agency.  As a result, the record does not support the protester’s allegation that t he agency applied unstated evaluation criteria such as external 
experience or evaluating the success of the program.  Moreover, the protester has not refuted the agency’s conclusion that its quotation does not discuss tangible results for this topic area and the record shows that the relevant portion of SCOR2E’s quotation does not discuss the tangible results or describe an evaluation of the success of the firm’s cited guide and training.  AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 
4-5.  As a res ult, the protester has given us no basis to question the evaluation in this 
regard.  
 Price Realism  
 SCOR2E next asserts that the agency improperly performed a price realism analysis, which was not provided for by the solicitation.  In support of its argument, SCOR2E focuses on a statement by the SSA in the best -value determination concluding that 
Cadmus’ s “superior technical solution conformed to all solicitation requirements to 
include prior technical experience that conveyed to pricing experience of the same and/or similar type of FEMA work.”  AR, Tab G, ADM at 16.  SCOR2E asserts that this language is evidence that the awardee’s higher price was a positive discriminator in the agency’s view, effectively penalizing SCOR2E for having a lower price.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 9.  By considering price in this way, SCOR2E asserts that the agency’s evaluati on was tantamount to a price realism analysis.  Id .  SCOR2E also asserts that 
the agency performed an unequal price realism analysis because it did not credit 
SCOR2E for its prior technical experience with FEMA and corresponding pricing experience.  Id. at 10.   
 The agency responds that the protester misconstrues the one sentence in the best -
value determination.  The agency contends the determination instead shows that prices were evaluated solely for fairness and reasonableness in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. MOL at 4- 5. 
 The record does not support the protester’s assertion that the agency performed a price realism analysis.  The purpose of a price realism evaluation is to determine whether proposed or quoted prices are so low that they are not realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a lack of clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; or are not consistent with the methods of performance described in the vendor’s technical proposal.  Ventera Corp. , B-418871, B -418871.2, Oct. 5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 345 at 7.  
The sentence quoted by the protester does not show that the awardee’s higher price was considered a positive discriminator, let alone imply that SCOR2E’s quotation was downgraded for having a lower price.  In fact, the agency does not reference ei ther 
firm’s price in the sentence.  The agency’s comment does nothing more than acknowledge that the awardee’s technical approach conformed to the solicitation requirements and note that the awardee’s work experience with FEMA includes  Page 10 B-423315; B-423315.2  experience with the price for such work.  The challenged statement refers to experience 
and does not convey a view about either firm’s actual price.   
 The only consideration of price in the best -value determination was reflected in the 
agency’s conclusion that both SCOR2E’s and Cadmus’s prices were fair and reasonable.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 7.  Because the protester’s interpretation of the agency’s comment does not withstand logical scrutiny, we deny this aspect of the protest.  Federal Acquisition Servs. Team OASIS JV, LLC,  B-418776.6, B -418776.7, 
June 22, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 244 at 5; See  also,  e.g. Ventera supra at 7 (explaining that 
an agency’s conclusion t hat the protester’s technical approach may not be successful 
due to insufficient staff did not imply a price realism analysis).   Best-Value Determination  
 Finally, SCOR2E also asserts the agency made a flawed best -value determination for 
two reasons .
5  SCOR2E asserts the agency “downplayed the price premium” for 
Cadmus’s quotation because the agency determined there was a 22.3 percent price difference between the quotations, when in fact –  according to SCOR2E –  the 
difference is closer to 30 percent.
6  SCOR2E also asserts the determination does not 
reflect any actual analysis.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8.   
 Both these claims are belied by the record.  As already stated, in reviewing protests of an agency’s source selection decision in procurements conducted under the Federal 
Supply Schedule (FSS) procedures of FAR subpart  8.4, we do not conduct a new 
evaluation or substitute our judgement for that of the agency.   22nd Century Techs., 
Inc., B-422659.5, B -422659.6, Jan. 14, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶ 28 at 4.  Rather, we will 
review the record to ensure the agency ’s evaluation and award decision were 
reasonable and consis tent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement 
laws and regulations.   Id.  Procurements conducted using FSS procedures provide for a 
streamlined procurement process with minimal documentation requirements.   Id.   
 Regardless of the percentages referred to, the record shows that the agency was aware of and considered the actual prices proposed by the vendors and the difference between them in weighing the prices against the technical merits.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 16- 17.  Further, the record shows that the SSA analyzed and weighed the 
technical merits of both quotations.  For example, the agency expressly compared the 
 
5 SCOR2E also asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the 
alleged flaws in the technical evaluation.  Where other challenges to an evaluation of quotations have been denied or otherwise dismissed, a challenge to the best -value 
determination based on those allegations does not afford a basis to sustain the protest.

we have denied all the protester ’s other challenges to the evaluation of quotations 
therefore its challenge to the best -value determination on those bases  is dismissed.  
6 SCOR2E states that “Cadmus’s total price is 129 [percent] of SCOR2E’s total price, 
reflecting a nearly 30 [percent] price premium.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8.   Page 11 B-423315; B-423315.2  merits behind the ratings assigned to SCOR2E and Cadmus for the demonstrated prior 
experience subfactor – noting the topic areas that SCOR2E did not adequately address, 
and conversely noting that Cadmus’s quotation had successfully addressed all topic areas as evinced by the superior prior experience it demonstrated.  Id. at 8 -9.  As the 
protester has failed to show that the best -value determination is flawed or insufficiently 
documented, this protest ground is denied.

DECISION  
 SCOR2E,
1 of Herndon, Virginia, protests the establishment of a blanket purchase 
agreement (BPA) with The Cadmus Group, LLC, of Waltham, Massachusetts, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 70FB8024Q00000008, issued by the Department of 
Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), for technical 
assistance.  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated its 
 
1 SCOR2E is a contractor team arrangement formed by ATCS PLC, of Herndon, 
Virginia, and Guidehouse, Inc., of McLean, Virginia.  Protest at 17.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423315; B-423315.2  quotation, improperly conducted a price realism analysis, and made a flawed best -value 
determination.   
 
We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the RFQ on August 19, 2024, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 8.405- 2, to vendors holding contracts under General Services 
Administration multiple award schedule special item number (SIN) 541611 management and financial consulting, acquisition and grants management support, and business program and project management services.  Agency Report (AR), Tab C, RFQ amend. 0005 at 1; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 3.  FEMA issued the RFQ to obtain technical assista nce with response, recovery, and other disaster operations missions 
under the Office of Response and Recovery (ORR).  AR, Tab D, Statement of Work (SOW) at 2; Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3.  The ORR provides guidance and oversight for the coordination and delivery of support to those suffering from natural disasters and other emergencies.  FEMA, Office of Response and Recovery, https://www.fema.gov/about/offices/ response- recovery  (last visited May 9, 2025).  
Technical assistance is needed to help ORR personnel guide and oversee the response to these disasters.  COS at 1.           The BPA would be established with the vendor offering the best value to the government considering the following factors listed in descending order of importance:  technical and management approach (factor 1); capability of proposed key personnel 
and staff ing plan (factor 2); past performance (factor 3); price (factor 4); and 
subcontracting plan (factor 5).  RFQ at 5, 13.  As relevant here, the technical and management approach factor had two subfactors:  concept paper and demonstrated prior experience.  Id . at 5. 
 Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, vendors were to explain their experience by addressing 11 topic areas.  RFQ at 7.  For each topic area, vendors were to provide one recent and relevant example of prior experience.  Id .  These examples 
were to demonstrate experience with the corresponding statement of work (SOW) requirements as well.  Id.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the references 
vendors provided for each topic area and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id. at 8. Under the technical and management approach factor the agency 
would assign a rating of high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.
2  Id. 
at 10.   
 
2 As described herein, during the evaluation process, the agency also assigned a rating 
of high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence to quotations under each technical subfactor.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation 
at 1 (referring to the Adobe PDF pagination); AR, Tab G, Award Decision Memorandum (ADM) at 3; AR, Tab H, Post -Award Notice at 1.    Page 3 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency received quotations from seven vendors.  COS at 3.  The evaluation results 
for SCOR2E and Cadmus were as follows:  
 
 SCOR2E  Cadmus  
Technical and 
Management Approach:  Some  High 
      Concept  Paper        High High 
      Demonstrated Prior

Price  $64,080,276  $82,357,522  
 AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 7.  
 Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the technical evaluation team (TET) noted the qualities of SCOR2E’s quotation that raised or lowered its expectation that SCOR2E would successfully perform the contract.  Regarding topic areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10, the TET concluded that SCOR2E provided recent and relevant examples of its prior experience and demonstrated complete knowledge and understanding of the requirements.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2- 4.  
Regarding topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11, the TET concluded that SCOR2E’s quotation did 
not do so.  Id. at 2 -3.  The TET concluded that, overall, it had some confidence in 
SCOR2E’s ability to perform the contract based on its demonstrated prior experience.  Id. at 1.  Under the technical and management approach, SCOR2E’s quotation 
ultimately received a rating of some confidence.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.
3   
 After evaluations were completed, the SSA determined that SCOR2E’s quotation was the second- highest rated after the quotation submitted by Cadmus.  AR, Tab G, ADM 
at 16.  Both vendors’ prices were determined to be reasonable.  Id . at 7.   
 In comparing the quotations, the SSA noted that SCOR2E’s failure to adequately address all the topic areas under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor gave the 
agency only some confidence in its ability to perform the work required.  The SSA noted 
 
3 Neither the TET’s evaluation of SCOR2E’s quotation under subfactor 2, nor the source 
selection authority’s (SSA) decision in the ADM stated that SCOR2E, or any other 
vendor, received an “overall” technical rating.  However, the SSA wrote that Cadmus “is the only offeror who received high confidence ratings for Factor 1 and Factor 2,” 
implying that the agency had only some confidence in SCOR2E’s quotation under the technical factor overall.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.  This is consistent with how the parties have referred to SCOR2E’s subfactor 2 rating and FEMA’s impression of SCOR2E’s 
technical approach overall during these proceedings.    Page 4 B-423315; B-423315.2  that, while SCOR2E understood the requirements and proposed a sound approach for 
most of the topic areas, it did not provide experience that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements for topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Id. at 9.  Conversely, 
the agency noted that Cadmus demonstrated a thorough understanding of the requirements and successfully addressed all topic areas.  Id. at 10.  The SSA further 
noted that Cadmus’s superior experience gave the agency significantly more confidence in its ability to perform which merited its price premium.  Id.  The SSA determined that 
Cadmus provided the best value to the agency and made award to it on January 27, 2025.  COS at 7.  SCOR2E was notified the same day and this protest followed.   
 DISCUSSION  SCOR2E raises several challenges to the agency’s evaluation of quotations and asserts that the best -value determination is flawed.  We have considered all of SCOR2E’s 
arguments and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to federal supply schedule 
vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition, we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation.  Nittany Bus. Movers, Inc., B -411856, Oct. 27, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 327 at 1-
2.  A protester ’s disagreement with the agency ’s evaluation, without more, is not 
sufficient to sustain the protest.  Id. 
 Demonstrated Prior Experience  
 SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation under the 
demonstrated prior experience subfactor.  Specifically, SCOR2E challenges the agency’s findings under topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Protest at 8- 12.  SCOR2E asserts 
that had it not been for these alleged errors, it would have received a technical rating equal with that of Cadmus and would have likely received award because of its lower price.  Id . at 12.  We have reviewed all SCOR2E’s arguments and find that it has not 
demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable regarding any of the topic areas.  We address several examples below.   Again, under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the RFQ required vendors to provide one example of prior experience for each of the 11 topic areas, demonstrating their understanding of the corresponding SOW requirements.  RFQ at 7.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the vendors’ references and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id . at 8.   
 As a first example, topic area 3 required prior experience with “tangible results in Product Rollout Plan and Socialization Strategy Development.”  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.3 of the SOW –  support for product rollout plan and socialization strategy 
development – corresponded to this requirement.  Sub paragraph 4.3.1 of the SOW 
required that “The Contractor shall develop rollout plans for products including compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach  Page 5 B-423315; B-423315.2  and communication products, fact sheets and messaging to communicate key 
messages for FEMA programs.”  SOW at ¶ 4.3.1.   
 In its evaluation of SCOR2E’s quotation regarding topic 3, the agency noted the protester’s quotation described creating products such as a guide for the agency, an internal Microsoft SharePoint site, and talking points for meetings and trainings.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  However, the agency 
noted that these examples focused on internal products for the agency, like the guide, as opposed to external products for the public.  Id .  The agency also noted that the 
protester’s quotation did not provide enough information because it did not demonstrate 
experience with rollout plans for products such as video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, and outreach and communication products.  Id .  The 
agency’s findings regarding this topic contributed to the SSA’s determination that it had some confidence in SCOR2E’s prior experience.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 9, 15.    
 SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation regarding topic area 3 for several reasons.  The protester asserts that its quotation demonstrated experience with product rollout plans, and points to the portion of its quotation wherein it 
describes its experience developing, releasing, and rolling out an internal FEMA guide –  
“A Guide to Community Engagement.”  Protest at 8- 9; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  
Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.  The protester next asserts that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  According to the protester, the evaluation implies that SCOR2E was supposed to provide a rollout plan for each type of media listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, which was not required.  Protest at 8; Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.

4 The protester argues that the requirements in SOW ¶ 4.3.1 are performance 
requirements rather than evaluation criteria.  According to SCOR2E, this is made clear by the SOW’s  reference to the “ Contractor ” as opposed to the vendor.  SOW at ¶ 4.3.1.   
SCOR2E asserts that because the SOW sets forth requirements that must be met during contract performance, it was improper for FEMA to evaluate its quotation for compliance with the SOW requirements.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.  This argument is without merit because the solicitation made clear that the agency would evaluate quotations based on how they demonstrated experience with the SOW requirements.  The RFQ stated several times that each of the 11 topic areas corresponded to requirements in the SO W.  RFQ at 7 -8.  The instructions for quotation 
submissions for subfactor 2 stated in part that a vendor “shall demonstrate in the submission that it has recent and relevant demonstrated prior experience supporting the scope and complexity of requirements identified in the Statement of Work.”  Id. at 7.  
The RFQ also stated that the evaluation of subfactor 2 “is based on how well the demonstrated prior experience presented by the Offeror aligns with the eleven (11) topics listed above, which are all requirements listed in the SOW .”  Id. at 8 (emphasis 
added).  See MSN Servs., LLC,   B -414900, B -414900.2, et al. , Oct. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 310 at 6 (finding that where the SOW uses the term “contractor” throughout the SOW when referring to numerous evaluation requirements, it would be unreasonable to 
(continued...)   Page 6 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated SCOR2E’s quotation.  The agency 
first notes that the TET considered the protester’s experience creating and rolling out “A Guide to Community Engagement” for FEMA in its evaluation, as well as the other portions of its quotation that mentioned the creation of an internal SharePoint site and 
conducting meetings and trainings.  MOL at 9- 10; AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  
Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency asserts, however, that despite this prior experience, SCOR2E’s quotation was still insufficient because it did not 
demonstrate experience with a rollout plan that included compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach, or communication as required by the SOW.   MOL at 10.  The agency further asserts that the protester does not 
dispute that its quotation does not demonstrate this experience, but rather only asserts that it was not required to do so.  Id .  The agency argues that the RFQ expressly 
required vendors  to demonstrate their experience with all of the requirements in the 
SOW, like the various types of media listed in paragraph 4.3.1.  Id .   
 Here, we find that SCOR2E has not demonstrated that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  The record shows that the agency considered SCOR2E’s prior experience creating the internal guide, as well as the SharePoint site and the trainings and meetings conducted.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 
Evaluation at 2.  The record also shows that SCOR2E’s quotation does not mention any other types of media, like those listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, and the protester has not asserted that its quotation addresses these other media types.  Id.; AR, Tab E, 
SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.   
 Lastly, the agency’s evaluation does not show that it expected the protester to describe 
a rollout plan for each type of media.  As discussed above, producing rollout plans in general was a requirement of paragraph 4.3.1, but the evaluation criteria requir ed only 
that vendors describe one experience example per topic area.  RFQ at 7.  More to the point, the agency did not in fact find that the protester’s quotation lacked rollout plans, rather; it found that the nature of the experience was limited to supporting internal communication as opposed to external media or communications.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (noting that “The offeror did not 
demonstrate the SOW requirement of ‘compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach & communication products. . . .  Their response focuses more on internal products and the development of a guide as opposed to development of an external media or communications product.”).  The protester does not directly dispute this finding, as a result, this protest ground is denied.  
 As another example, topic area 6 required prior experience with “tangible results in Policy and Procedures Development.”  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.6 of the SOW – policy 
and procedures development –  corresponded to this requirement, which included four 
 
interpret the solicitation’s use of the term “contractor” as indicating performance requirements because the solicitation advised vendors that their quotations needed to address the SOW requirements at issue and the agency would be precluded from evaluating any aspect of a vendor’s technical capability).    Page 7 B-423315; B-423315.2  sub paragraphs.  The sub paragraphs listed several requirements, including that the 
contractor support the development of policies and procedures in several ways:  by collaborating with various stakeholders, supporting the development of associated materia ls in accordance with various formatting guidelines and other requirements, 
supporting the development of the plan of action milestones, and facilitating meetings.  SOW at ¶¶ 4.6.1 -4.6.4.  
 In its evaluation of SCOR2E’s quotation regarding topic area 6, the agency determined that SCOR2E’s quotation “provided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.”  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency then referred to several 
parts of SCOR2E’s quotation supporting this conclusion:  “The offeror mentioned ‘including a policy and procedure review’.  ‘Supported [Field Operations Directorate] in development of the FEMA Strategic Recruitment Plan (SRP) by providing organized, 
structured meetings and activities with actionable outcomes . . .’ (pages three to four).”  Id. 
 SCOR2E asserts that the agency’s evaluation unreasonably ignored information in its quotation.  SCOR2E asserts that its quotation discusses the development of a FEMA policy and procedure and mentioned facilitating meetings.  Protest at 12; AR, Tab E, SCOR2 E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 3- 4.  The agency responds that the 
example cited by SCOR2E was considered by the agency and cited in the evaluation.  The agency also responds that SCOR2E’s quotation does not contain details that the agency failed to consider.  The agency asserts the protester’s argument amounts to nothing other than disagreement with the agency’s judgment that its quotation lacked 
sufficient detail.  MOL at 12.      
 Here, we agree that SCOR2E has failed to show that the evaluation is unreasonable.  As the agency notes, the portions of the quotation SCOR2E claims the agency ignored are specifically cited in the evaluation record as the basis for the agency’s conclusion that SCOR2E’s quotation was too broad.  Compare AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  
Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (the agency states that SCOR2E’s quotation “provided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter,” citing to pages three and four of SCOR2E’s 
quotation) with Protest at 12 (where SCOR2E argues that the agency ignored the 
information on pages three and four of its quotation).  The protester does not cite to any other portions of its quotation to support its claim that its quotation is sufficiently specific.  As a result, the protester’s arguments amount to disagreement with the agency’s 
judgment, as the protester has not shown that the agency’s conclusions were illogical or unsupported by the record, but simply asserts that the portions of its quotation that the agency found to be broad should be read as adequately addressing the requirements.  Int’l Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. , B-419737.3, Dec. 20, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 85 at 6.  
 As another example, topic area 8 required prior experience with “tangible results in Program Analysis, Assessment and Management.”  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.8 of the SOW – support for program analysis, assessment, management and reports –  Page 8 B-423315; B-423315.2  corresponded to this requirement.  This section of the SOW contained 21 subtasks, 
such as implementing ORR programs by analyzing and assessing program data, conducting performance management and analytical studies, and analyzing existing program data and producing reports.  SOW at ¶¶ 4.8.8, 4.8.11- 4.8.14, 4.8.19- 4.8.21.   
 In evaluating SCOR2E’s quotation under topic area 8, the agency found that it did not demonstrate an understanding of program analysis and assessment.  The agency stated that the examples in SCOR2E’s quotation “focused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.”  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 
Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 3.  The agency quoted the following portions of SCOR2E’s quotation as supporting its conclusion:  “ ‘Our team identified trends that were discussed in a Leadership Alignment Session, Future- State Visioning Workshop and Prioritization 
Framework and Workshop with [hazard mitigation assistance] leadership. (3) Guidehouse used its expertise and knowledge of FEMA to develop four guiding 
principles for the hybrid work envi ronment .  . .’ (page five).”  Id. at 3.   
 SCO2E asserts that the agency’s evaluation is unreasonable because there was no requirement in the RFQ or the SOW for “external experience” or “evaluating the success of the program,” and therefore the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Protest at 10- 11; Comments & Supp. Protest at 5.  The protester also argues that even 
if it was required to demonstrate this external -facing experience, it did so, as its 
quotation described experience related to FEMA stakeholders, customers, and local and state government partners.  Protest at 11.   
 The agency responds that it did not apply unstated evaluation criteria and contends that 
the protester’s argument is based on a misreading of the evaluation findings.  The agency explains that its note that SCOR2E’s quotation focused “internally” refers to its 
quotation’s focus on internal processes as opposed to tangible results and did not imply that there was an external experience or focus requirement.  MOL at 14.  The agency further explains that its note regarding “evaluating the success of the program” also referred to SCOR2E’s quotation’s failure to describe the tangible results from its program analysis.  Id .  The agency further responds that the protester has not asserted 
that its quotation demonstrates the success of a program or discusses tangible results, and therefore the protester has not demonstrated that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  Id .   
 We agree with the agency that the protester has not demonstrated the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  The record shows that the agency’s explanation of the evaluator’s notes is consistent with the evaluator’s notes as stated in the evaluation.   In 
its evaluation the agency cited to the portions of SCOR2E’s quotation that describe a guide produced for internal use by FEMA staff and an internal leadership training, and the agency noted that SCOR2E’s quotation “focused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.”  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 
Evaluation at 3; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 5.  The 
agency’s note that SCOR2E’s quotation “focused internally rather than evaluating the succe ss of the program,” considered with the portions of SCOR2E’s quotation the  Page 9 B-423315; B-423315.2  agency chose to cite, shows that the agency was referring to the protester’s 
demonstration of internal products as opposed to discussing tangible results as asserted by the agency.  As a result, the record does not support the protester’s allegation that t he agency applied unstated evaluation criteria such as external 
experience or evaluating the success of the program.  Moreover, the protester has not refuted the agency’s conclusion that its quotation does not discuss tangible results for this topic area and the record shows that the relevant portion of SCOR2E’s quotation does not discuss the tangible results or describe an evaluation of the success of the firm’s cited guide and training.  AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 
4-5.  As a res ult, the protester has given us no basis to question the evaluation in this 
regard.  
 Price Realism  
 SCOR2E next asserts that the agency improperly performed a price realism analysis, which was not provided for by the solicitation.  In support of its argument, SCOR2E focuses on a statement by the SSA in the best -value determination concluding that 
Cadmus’ s “superior technical solution conformed to all solicitation requirements to 
include prior technical experience that conveyed to pricing experience of the same and/or similar type of FEMA work.”  AR, Tab G, ADM at 16.  SCOR2E asserts that this language is evidence that the awardee’s higher price was a positive discriminator in the agency’s view, effectively penalizing SCOR2E for having a lower price.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 9.  By considering price in this way, SCOR2E asserts that the agency’s evaluati on was tantamount to a price realism analysis.  Id .  SCOR2E also asserts that 
the agency performed an unequal price realism analysis because it did not credit 
SCOR2E for its prior technical experience with FEMA and corresponding pricing experience.  Id. at 10.   
 The agency responds that the protester misconstrues the one sentence in the best -
value determination.  The agency contends the determination instead shows that prices were evaluated solely for fairness and reasonableness in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. MOL at 4- 5. 
 The record does not support the protester’s assertion that the agency performed a price realism analysis.  The purpose of a price realism evaluation is to determine whether proposed or quoted prices are so low that they are not realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a lack of clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; or are not consistent with the methods of performance described in the vendor’s technical proposal.  Ventera Corp. , B-418871, B -418871.2, Oct. 5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 345 at 7.  
The sentence quoted by the protester does not show that the awardee’s higher price was considered a positive discriminator, let alone imply that SCOR2E’s quotation was downgraded for having a lower price.  In fact, the agency does not reference ei ther 
firm’s price in the sentence.  The agency’s comment does nothing more than acknowledge that the awardee’s technical approach conformed to the solicitation requirements and note that the awardee’s work experience with FEMA includes  Page 10 B-423315; B-423315.2  experience with the price for such work.  The challenged statement refers to experience 
and does not convey a view about either firm’s actual price.   
 The only consideration of price in the best -value determination was reflected in the 
agency’s conclusion that both SCOR2E’s and Cadmus’s prices were fair and reasonable.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 7.  Because the protester’s interpretation of the agency’s comment does not withstand logical scrutiny, we deny this aspect of the protest.

an agency’s conclusion t hat the protester’s technical approach may not be successful 
due to insufficient staff did not imply a price realism analysis).   Best-Value Determination  
 Finally, SCOR2E also asserts the agency made a flawed best -value determination for 
two reasons .
5  SCOR2E asserts the agency “downplayed the price premium” for 
Cadmus’s quotation because the agency determined there was a 22.3 percent price difference between the quotations, when in fact –  according to SCOR2E –  the 
difference is closer to 30 percent.
6  SCOR2E also asserts the determination does not 
reflect any actual analysis.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8.   
 Both these claims are belied by the record.  As already stated, in reviewing protests of an agency’s source selection decision in procurements conducted under the Federal 
Supply Schedule (FSS) procedures of FAR subpart  8.4, we do not conduct a new 
evaluation or substitute our judgement for that of the agency.   22nd Century Techs.,

review the record to ensure the agency ’s evaluation and award decision were 
reasonable and consis tent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement 
laws and regulations.   Id.  Procurements conducted using FSS procedures provide for a 
streamlined procurement process with minimal documentation requirements.   Id.   
 Regardless of the percentages referred to, the record shows that the agency was aware of and considered the actual prices proposed by the vendors and the difference between them in weighing the prices against the technical merits.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 16- 17.  Further, the record shows that the SSA analyzed and weighed the 
technical merits of both quotations.  For example, the agency expressly compared the 
 
5 SCOR2E also asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the 
alleged flaws in the technical evaluation.  Where other challenges to an evaluation of quotations have been denied or otherwise dismissed, a challenge to the best -value 
determination based on those allegations does not afford a basis to sustain the protest.

DECISION  
 Mobomo LLC, a small business of Gaithersburg, Maryland, protests the issuance of an order to ResolveSoft Inc., a small business of Elkridge, Maryland, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 1305M324Q0367, issued by the Department of Commerce, 
National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for web modernization and 
maintenance services.  The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of quotations and conduct of exchanges . 
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on August 9, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4 (Federal Supply Schedules), to small DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  business firms holding the General Services Administration’s (GSA) multiple- award 
federal supply schedule (FSS) contract for information technology professional services.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFQ at 1- 3.1  
The RFQ contemplated the issuance of a single order, with a 6- month phase -in period, 
a 1-year base period of performance and two 1- year option periods.  RFQ at 1- 3.  
NOAA sought support services to  maintain and enhance the National Marine Fisheries 
Service flagship website,  www. fisheries.noaa.gov .  AR, Tab 4, Performance Work 
Statement (PWS) at 4.  
The solicitation advised that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, 
considering three non- price factors:  (1)  technical approach; (2) staffing and 
management approach/key personnel; and (3) experience.  RFQ at 65.  The RFQ 
explained that the non- price factors were of equal importance and, when combined, 
were significantly more important than price.  Id . at 64- 65.  NOAA would apply one of 
three adjectival confidence ratings for each of the non- price evaluation factors:  high 
confidence; some confidence; and low confidence.  Id . at 65.   
 Under the technical approach factor, quotations would be evaluated “ to assess the 
degree to which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound 
approach to, and experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this 
solicitation. ”  Id. at 65.  While the staffing and management approach/key personnel 
factor would similarly be evaluated to assess whether the vendor “demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, and experience to successfully  perform 
the [RFQ’s] requirements [,]” the agency would also evaluate “the strength of  the 
proposed key personnel including education and professional certifications/credentials ” 
and “ the currency, quality and depth of experience of the proposed key personnel  
working on similar projects. ”  Id.   
 
Under the experience factor, NOAA would “determine the recency and relevancy based 
on similar size, scope, and magnitude to the PWS” and “evaluate the quality, depth and degree of the quoter’s experience.”  Id.  The RFQ further explained that “ the quoter’s 
experience will be evaluated to assess the Government’s  level of confidence of its 
demonstrated experience with platforms, systems, methodology, and software identified 
in the PWS, or similarly related technology, including, but not limited to, Acquia Drupal
2 
[platform as a service (PaaS)] , Akamai [web application firewall (WAF)/content delivery 
network (CDN)] , Agile/Scrum methodology, [user experience ( UX)]- driven design and 
development, and data- driven decision making. ”  Id.  Price would be evaluated for 
completeness and reasonableness.  Id. at 66.

RFP at 64.  Specifically, the solicitation explained:  
 
Once the Government determines the contractor that is the best -suited 
(i.e., the apparent  successful contractor), the Government reserves the 
right to communicate with only that contractor to  address any remaining 
issues, if necessary, and finalize a task order with that contractor.  These 
issues  may include t echnical/staffing/management/key personnel and 
price, as well as increasing or decreasing the level of effort and/or 
requirements due to funding availability and changes to the period of  
performance at  the Government’s discretion.    
 Id. 
 The agency received timely submitted quotations from three vendors, including from Mobomo and ResolveSoft.  COS at 6.  Following its evaluation, NOAA identified ResolveSoft as the best -suited vendor and entered into exchanges with 
the firm.  COS at 7.  Through these exchanges, ResolveSoft upwardly revised its price quotation.  AR, Tab 17, Exchanges with ResolveSoft at  1; AR, Tab 28, 
ResolveSoft Pricing Revisions at 2.  NOAA issued the order to ResolveSoft on September 19.  COS at 8.  
 Mobomo filed a protest with our Office on October 3, challenging NOAA’s evaluation of quotations.  On October 15, our Office dismissed Mobomo’s protest as academic, based on the agency’s stated intention to undertake corrective 
action; NOAA explained it wo uld “re- evaluate the quotes it received in response 
to the solicitation and subsequently issue a new source selection decision.”  
Mobomo LLC , B-423027, Oct. 15, 2024 (unpublished decision).   
 In implementing its corrective action, NOAA undertook a reevaluation of quotations, resulting in the following ratings for Mobomo’s and ResolveSoft’s quotations:  
 
 Mobomo  ResolveSoft  
Technical Approach  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  
Staffing and Management 
Approach/Key Personnel  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  
Experience  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  
Total Evaluated Price  $11,030,164  $11,470,934  
 AR, Tab 24, Corrective Action Award Decision Document (ADD) at 12. 
 NOAA found ResolveSoft ’s quotation to represent the best value to the agency, 
“considering its technically superior approach, senior key personnel, and extensive 
experience. ”  Id. at 16.  The agency further explained that “ResolveSoft’s quote offers a 
technically superior, low risk option compared to Mobomo, and the technically superior  Page 4 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  features . . . are worth the slight price premium associated with ResolveSoft’s quote. ”  
Id.  NOAA issued the task order to ResolveSoft  on or about February 26, 2025.  COS 
at 14.  Mobomo filed the instant protest on March 10.  
 
DISCUSSION  Mobomo marshals several challenges to the agency’s conduct of the procurement.  In this regard, the protester contends the agency’s evaluation of its quotation across the non-price factors was flawed, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the terms of the 
solicitation.  Specifically, Mobomo argues NOAA improperly identified a number of 
quotation features that decreased the agency’s confidence that the firm could successfully perform the contract and applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Moreover, the protest er asserts the evaluation was unequal, where NOAA applied a much harsher 
standard to its review of Mobomo’s quotation as compared to ResolveSoft’s quotation.  The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate quotations in a manner  consistent with the RFQ’s evaluation scheme.  Additionally, the protester 
argues the agency erred by not also engaging in exchanges with Mobomo.  For the reasons that follow, we find no basis to sustain the protest.

 Technical Evaluation  
 Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and 
conducts a competition for the issuance of an order or establishment of a blanket purchase agreement , we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation 
 
3 Mobomo raises other collateral allegations, and although our decision does not 
specifically address every argument presented, we have considered each argument and find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.   For example, under the 
staffing and management approach/key personnel factor, vendors were required to “explain how the proposed labor categories from its  GSA Schedule contract are 
equivalent to the labor categories specified in the PWS  in terms of position 
duties/responsibilities and qualifications[.]”  RFQ at 60.  The protester argues the agency improperly concluded that Mobomo’s proposed labor categories and corresponding qualifications referenced in its quotation “are not fully equivalent to the required qualifications outlined in the PWS [.]”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 6.   
However, based on our review of the record, we find reasonable the agency’s evaluation findings.  Indeed, it is not immediately ascertainable from the chart in the protester’s quotation whether the positions cited in the evaluation report do, in fact, meet  the minimum requirements as established in the PWS.  Compare AR, Tab 10, 
Mobomo Technical Quotation at 19- 21 (Mobomo’s crosswalk with identified 
qualifications), with PWS at 15 -19 (requiring specific levels of education and/or 
experience for each position).  It is a vendor ’s responsibility to submit  a well- written 
quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. Inc. , B-422351, Apr. 25,

In reviewing a protest challenging an agency ’s technical evaluation, our Office will not 
reevaluate the quotations; rather, we will examine the record to determine whether the agency ’s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  OPTIMUS Corp. , 
B-400777, Jan. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 33 at 4.  A protester ’s disagreement with the 
agency ’s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was 
unreasonable.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2.   
 We have reviewed each of Mobomo’s  arguments concerning the agency ’s evaluation 
under the non- price  factors , and, as reflected in the following representative examples, 
we find no basis to sustain the protes t.  
 First, Mobomo challenges the agency’s assessment of items that decreased the agency’s confidence in the protester’s quotation under the technical approach factor.  Relevant here, the technical approach factor was to be “ evaluated to assess the degree 
to which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, 
and experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation. ”  
RFQ at 65.  Both vendors were assigned a “some confidence” rating under this factor.  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  For Mobomo’s quotation, while NOAA found 
several technical features that increased the agency’s confidence of successful performance, NOAA found five elements that were identified to decrease the agency’s confidence, al l of which Mobomo challenges in this protest.  
 As one example, under the PWS’s project management task (task 1), the successful vendor will be expected to, among other things, “[m]anage software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to existing systems or processes. ”  PWS at  6.  In 
its evaluation, the agency stated that Mobomo’s quotation “ does not address a strategy 
or method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions [.]”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The protester finds fault with the 
agency’s  conclusions, contending its quotation did manifest a cogent strategy for 
software upgrades with little disruption.  Protest at 24- 25; Comments and Supp. Protest 
at 18- 20; 2nd Supp. Comments at 16- 17.
4  Specifically, Mobomo points to its four -
phased risk management plan, use of the Jira software application for software upgrade tracking and documentation, and its use of continuous integration and deployment.  See  
AR, Tab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 8- 10.   
 However, the agency disagrees that these features, and Mobomo’s overall plan, were sufficiently detailed to warrant a different evaluation finding.  The technical evaluation team (TET) chair provided a declaration to support the agency’s findings, in which he 
 
4 Following briefing on Mobomo’s supplemental protest allegation, our Office asked for 
additional briefing from the parties.  Electronic Protest Docketing System (EPDS) No. 24.  We refer to this round of briefing as the “2nd. Supplemental.”   Page 6 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  noted that the protester’s plan lacked specificity.  TET Chair Dec. at 2.  For example, 
with respect to its four -phased risk management plan, the TET chair explains that 
Mobomo’s plan is “simply too high -level” and does not sufficiently describe how 
Mobomo’s approach would minimize disruptions.  Id .  Similarly, with respect to 
continuous integration and development, the TET chair provides that while these are important tools, these “primarily focus on code quality and security, not on ensuring a smooth and disruption- free upgrade. ”  Id. 
 Moreover, with respect to Mobomo’s use of Jira, the TET chair explains that this web-based tool is essentially a service request tracking notebook.  Id .  But, while “[t] aking 
notes is necessary to do, ” the TET chair provides that reliance on Jira “ is a lackluster 
response to this requirement ” because it is not wholly responsive to meet the agency’s 
need, nor was its use explained with sufficient detail with respect to minimizing disruptions.  Id . at 2 -3.  Mobomo disagrees with the TET’s assessment; in the 
protester’s view, “ Jira is not just  a web- based tracking tool; rather, it is a project 
management platform used for  quality assurance.”  2nd Supp. Comments at  15-16.  In 
this regard, the protester’s protest submissions argue that Jira represents a multi -step 
process that “ensures quality and minimizes disruptions during software upgrades.”  Id. 
at 16.    However, given the lack of these supporting details presented in Mobomo’s quotation (rather than as further explained in the protester’s briefs during this protest), we cannot conclude the agency’s evaluation determinations are unreasonable.  Compare AR, 
Tab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 9 (noting only the use Jira to “track, monitor, 
and plan for software upgrades, minimizing disruption to existing systems and ensuring 
timely updates ”) with 2nd Supp. Comments at 15- 17 (providing significant detail on how 
Jira would be utilized for software upgrades).  As addressed above, it is a vendor’s responsibility to submit a quotation with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. , 
supra.  To the extent Mobomo’s protest submissions attempt to more clearly articulate its proposed technical approach, our review is limited to the quotation, as submitted, as contracting agencies are not responsible for evaluating information that is  not included 
in a quotation.  Patriot Def. Grp., LLC , B-418720.3, Aug.  5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 265 at 9.  
 Second, Mobomo also suggests NOAA’s evaluation conclusions under the technical approach factor reflect unequal treatment among vendors, where the agency applied exacting scrutiny to the protester’s quotation yet acted with insouciance when it came to Resol veSoft’s alleged lack of similar detail.  That is, to prevail on an allegation of 
disparate treatment, a protester must show that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation in a different manner than another quotation that was substantively indistinguishable or nearly identical.  CGI Fed., Inc. , B-423041 et al. , Jan.13, 2025, 
2025 CPD ¶ 26 at 12.  
 As one example of alleged unequal treatment, Mobomo points to NOAA’s acceptance of the alleged mere mention of the use of Jira in ResolveSoft’s quotation but required significant detailed explanations when it came to Mobomo’s use of Jira.  2nd Supp.  Page 7 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Comments at  16.  The protester’s comparison is inapposite.  To this point, the record 
reflects that NOAA found benefit in ResolveSoft’s overall quality control and assurance 
(task 3) plan, to include its approach to “defect tracking”, where the awardee explained it would “use Jira for defect tracking, linking defects to user stories to reduce recurrence 
by [DELETED] [percent].”  AR, Tab 14, ResolveSoft Technical Quotation at 12; see also 
AR, Tab  23, Evaluation Report at 9 (explaining several features of Res olveSoft’s 
quotation that increased confidence in successful performance, to include that the firm’s quotation “ mentions using Jira for defect tracking, ensuring that defects are linked to 
user stories to reduce recurrence by [DELETED] [percent]” which “ highlights a 
structured approach to defect documentation and issue tracking. ”).   
 On the other hand, the agency faulted Mobomo’s quotation because while it also proposed to use Jira, the protester failed to explain how such use would allow for the management of “ software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to 
existing systems or processes ” as required under PWS task  1.  PWS at  6; see also TET 
Chair Dec. at 2- 3 (explaining that Jira is primarily a tool for service tracking as opposed 
to implementation).  Thus, the agency credited the awardee for its proposed use of Jira in connection with defect tracking under PWS task 3, while awarding a weakness for the 
protester’s failure to adequately explain the use of the tool in connection with management of software upgrades under PWS task 1; the differences in the agency’s evaluati on reasonably stem from differences in the quotations.  
 Similarly, the protester’s argument of disparate treatment concerning the vendors’ capability maturity model integration (CMMI) level 3 certifications fails to provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.
5  Mobomo contends NOAA relied on this certification to 
“mitigate” a weakness assigned to ResolveSoft, yet did not do so for a “similar” weakness assigned to the protester’s quotation.  As an initial matter, the record reflects the CMMI certification was fo und to increase confidence of successful performance for 
both Mobomo and ResolveSoft.
6  Notwithstanding that both vendors were positively 
credited for the same quotation feature, the protester complains that it was unreasonable for the agency to also address the awardee’s certification as helping to mitigate an assessed weakness, while not similarly mentioning the protester’s certification as helping to mitigate one of the protester’s assessed weaknesses.  2nd 
 
5 The CMMI Institute appraises organizations at levels from 0 to 5 to characterize that 
organization’s capability and performance.  See https://cmmiinstitute.com/learning/ 
appraisals/levels  (last visited May 26, 2025).  The CMMI institute characterizes maturity 
level 3 as “proactive rather than reactive” where “[o]rganization- wide standards provide 
guidance across projects, programs, and portfolios.”  Id . 
6 Specifically, both offerors received nearly identical strengths because NOAA 
concluded that CMMI level 3 practices meant “the vendor has an organizational approach to development practices, which is relevant for project management and risk management (PWS  Task 1), technical solutions (Task 2), quality assurance and 
requirements management (PWS Task 3), and product integration (PWS Task 5).”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  Thus, the record reflects that both offerors were similarly positively credited for their respective CMMI certifications.  Page 8 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Supp. Comments at 17- 18.  However, to whatever extent the record suggests that the 
agency considered ResolveSoft’s CMMI level 3 certification, in this regard, it also makes 
clear that both offerors were similarly assessed weaknesses for providing inadequat e 
detail in their responses to the PWS task 1 requirements, thus negating any alleged “unequal” treatment.  
 Specifically, Mobomo received a weakness because its quotation did “not address a strategy or method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions (PWS Task 1).”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The record reflects that ResolveSoft similarly received a weakness for its failure to provide adequate details 
with respect to managing project risks under PWS task 1.  Id. at 9.  Although the 
awardee was positively evaluated based on its “comprehensive and carefully planned” approach to project management and its approach to planning and task decomposition, 
the agency noted concern with the lack of adequate detail in the awardee’s plan to “identify risks, minimize the impact of unforeseen issues, respond to outages, or manage s oftware upgrades.”  Id.  at 8-10.  The TET explained that ResolveSoft’s CMMI 
level 3 certification “indicates the use of processes that support effective risk management,” and the quotation otherwise provided some software upgrade details under PWS task  7.  Id. at 10.   
 Fatal to the protester’s argument, however, is that notwithstanding the foregoing potential mitigating points, the TET nevertheless assigned a weakness to ResolveSoft’s quotation, specifically explaining that “[t]he omission from Task 1 decreases the Gover nment’s confidence that Team ResolveSoft can effectively manage project risks 
with minimal intervention.”  Id. at 10.  Accordingly, to whatever degree the agency 
considered the awardee’s CMMI certification, it nevertheless assigned a weakness to the awarde e’s quotation.  Thus, where both vendors were positively assessed for 
possessing CMMI certifications, and neither offeror avoided an adverse evaluation finding as a result of their certifications, the record fails to demonstrate that the agency’s evaluation was unequal.  
 Next, Mobomo argues the agency, in contravention of the terms of the RFQ, failed to reasonably consider “experience” in its evaluation of vendors’ offered technical approaches under the first evaluation factor.  See Protest at 37- 38; 2nd Supp. 
Comments at  27-28.  As noted above, under the technical approach factor, a vendor’s 
“overall technical approach will be evaluated to assess the degree to which the quote 
demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, and experience to 
successfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation.” (emphasis added).  
This evaluation factor was distinct from the third evaluation factor, which specifically evaluated vendors’ prior experience.  RFQ at 65.  The protester contends NOAA, in its evaluation under the technical approach factor, overlooked the firm’s “unmatched track record in performing the RFQ requirements on behalf of NOAA under the incumbent  
contract [,]” as well as its high marks for such performance in the Contractor 
Performance Assessment  Reporting System (CPARS), and in turn failed to consider 
ResolveSoft’s alleged lack of relevant federal experience.  Protest at 37.  The protester’s arguments unreasonably characterize the agency’s contemporaneous  Page 9 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  evaluation record, which demonstrates that the agency reasonably considered offerors’ 
relevant experience as part of the technical approach factor.  
 Relevant here, the contemporaneous evaluation record unquestionably demonstrates that the agency, consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation scheme, considered vendors’ respective experience as part of the technical approach evaluation.  Specifically, t he agency identified three aspects of Mobomo’s prior experience that 
increased the agency’s confidence under the technical approach factor, including:  
 
• As the incumbent, Mobomo has an understanding of and significant experience with NOAA Fisheries’ processes, priorities, and organizational structure and the websites’ infrastructure, codebase, 
and policies. . . .  
 
• Mobomo’s status as a Drupal Certified Partner, Acquia Community 
Partner, and member of the [Amazon Web Services] Partner Network 
increases the Government’s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, dev ops, and 
performance monitoring. . . .  
 
• Mobomo’s experience with Drupal’s multilingual modules and 
integrating third- party translation services increases the Government’s 
confidence that they can successfully execute PWS Task 6 requirements related to page translations if the Government chooses to carry out that optional special project.  
 AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  
 For ResolveSoft, the agency positively noted that:  “Team ResolveSoft’s bench of Acquia - and Drupal -certified developers and 20+ years of Drupal development 
experience increases the Government’s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, devops, and performance monitoring.”  Id. at 9. 
 Thus, the record demonstrates that --separate and apart from the evaluation of vendors’ 
respective experience under the experience evaluation factor --the agency also 
reasonably considered vendors’ respective relevant experience under the technical approach factor.  To the extent that the protester raises additional discrete challenges to 
the agency’s evaluation of experience, we find no merit to those arguments.  
 For example, notwithstanding that the agency positively credited Mobomo for its incumbent experience under the technical approach factor (as noted above), the protester suggests that such a strength should have been afforded considerably more significance.   We disagree.  We have consistently explained that there is no 
requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or  Page 10 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent contractor.  Tuknik 
Gov’t Servs., LLC , B-422862.2, Dec. 30, 2024, 2025 CPD ¶ 17 at  4. 
 Similarly, the protester’s allegation that ResolveSoft should have been downgraded for not having relevant federal experience fails to establish a basis on which to sustain the protest.  Nothing in the technical approach factor limited experience only to r elevant 
federal  experience; rather, the agency was only to evaluate proffered experience to the 
extent it demonstrated the offeror’s ability to successfully perform  the requirements 
stated within the solicitation .  See RFQ at 65.  Given the commercial nature of the 
software at issue, it was not unreasonable for the agency to consider an offeror’s general experience working with the software or platforms, regardless of whether the customer was a government or commercial entity.  In this regard, the experienc e 
evaluation factor specifically allowed for the submission of references for work performed for government agencies or commercial entities, and noted that in terms of relevance, the government was particularly interested in “the quoter’s demonstrated experience with platforms, systems, methodology, and software identified in the PWS, or similarly related technology, including, but not limited to, Acquia Drupal PaaS, Akamai WAF/CDN, Agile/Scrum methodology, UX -driven design and development, and 
data- driven decision making.”  RFQ at 60.  The protester does not offer any reason why 
the relevancy considerations for the technical approach factor should be read more restrictively than the relevancy requirements set forth under the experience evaluation factor.  
 As a final example of its challenges under the technical approach factor, the protester argues the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria where NOAA unreasonably 
inflated the importance of PWS task 3 (quality control and quality assurance) and task 5 (user experience, usability, design, and content support) in its evaluation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at 8- 14; Supp. Comments at 9- 14; 2nd Supp. Comments at 29- 34.  In 
this regard, Mobomo contends that the RFQ did not provide for giving more weight to different tasks in the agency’s evaluation yet the agency’s best -value decision elevated 
tasks 3 and 5 above all others, which fundamentally skewed NOAA’s selection decision.  Id.  Mobomo points to a specific portion of the agency’s award decision in support of its 
argument:  
 
As the incumbent, Mobomo brings institutional knowledge and experience with [agency]  processes, priorities, and organizational structure, as well as 
the website’s infrastructure, codebase, and policies.  However, the current 
requirement expands on and introduces requirements intended to enhance both service quality (user experience, website performance, and reliability) and product quality (code integrity, feature functionality, and technical performance),  which differ from the previous contract supported 
by Mobomo and reflect the project’s more advanced state.  It is in meeting 
these requirements that Mobomo is inferior to the other vendor.  
 AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13- 14. 
  Page 11 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement that an agency must evaluate 
quotations consistent with the terms of the solicitation and, while the evaluation of vendors’ quotations generally is a matter within the procuring agency’s discretion, our Office will question an agency’s evaluation where it is unreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria, or undocumented.   Tantus Techs., Inc. , 
B-411608, B -411608.3, Sept. 14, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 299 at 6.   
 Contrary to the protester’s contention, the record does not support Mobomo’s assertion regarding the unfair weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 in the agency’s evaluation under the technical approach factor.  First, the technical evaluation demonstrates the agency considered the positive and negative aspects of both vendors’ quotations across all the PWS task areas.  See, e.g.,  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3 -4, 9-10.  Second, the 
record evidences that the source selection authority did highlight Mobomo’s deficiencies, as compared to ResolveSoft, specifically with regard to elements of PWS 
tasks 3 and 5.  See e.g.,  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13 (noting that Mobomo’s “ technical 
approach lacked clarity and details in several key aspects of the PWS, specifically in [tasks 3 and 5].”).   
 However, the same paragraph cited by the protester as confirmation of impermissible weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 also highlights Mobomo’s shortcomings in another PWS area, task 1 (project management).  Id . (identifying Mobomo’s quotation as lacking 
detail in how it would handle defect recurrence).  Thus, the record does not support a contention that NOAA was exclusively concerned with PWS tasks 3 and 5.  Third, and most relevant to our analysis, the mere f act that a source selection authority finds 
discri minators in some, but not all, of the evaluated tasks does not equate to the 
agency’s consideration of those specific tasks above all others.  Indeed, in a best -value 
procurement, particularly where technical factors are more important than price, an agenc y may focus on a particular discriminator, and merely highlighting a specific 
aspect of a quotation in the selection decision does not, by itself, render the evaluation unreasonable.  See, e.g.,  SGT, Inc., B -405736,  B-405736.2 Dec. 27, 2011, 2012 CPD

¶ 223 at 12- 13.  
 Next, turning to the agency’s evaluation under the staffing and management approach/key personnel factor, Mobomo challenges NOAA’s evaluation of its key personnel, arguing the agency unreasonably found that the resumes for all three of the firm’s key perso ns failed to demonstrate experience in several key PWS areas.  Protest 
at 39-48; Comments and Supp. Protest at 26- 32; Supp. Comments at 17- 18; 2nd Supp. 
Comments at 34- 59.  Again, based upon our review of the record, we find nothing 
unreasonable with the agency’s evaluation.  We address one representative example, below.  
 Vendors were required to submit resumes for three identified key persons:  (1) a w eb 
project manager/ scrum master ; (2) l ead developer/ technical architect ; and (3) digital 
product analyst/UX researcher .  RFQ at 13, 59- 60.  NOAA would evaluate, among other 
things, “ the strength of  the proposed key personnel including education and  Page 12 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  professional certifications/credentials ” as well as “ the currency, quality and depth of 
experience of the proposed key personnel  working on similar projects. ”  RFQ at 65.  For 
each identified key personnel position, the PWS provided a bullet point list of primary 
responsibilities.  See e.g., PWS at  14 (identifying 13 core areas the web project 
manager/scrum master would perform).   
 The agency’s evaluation found several aspects of Mobomo’s proposed web project manager/scrum master that increase NOAA’s confidence in successful performance of the contract.  See AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 4 (identifying several positive 
aspects of the web project manager’s resume and experience relevant to the subject PWS).  However, the evaluators also found that the web project manager’s resume did not demonstrate “ experience in three responsibilities of the role that are important to the 
success of project requirements and goals [.]”  Id. at 5.  Specifically, the TET explained 
that the project manager/scrum master did not demonstrate experience to:  (1) m onitor 
and manage project risks throughout the development process , which “ directly relates to 
risk management requirements ”; (2) o versee quality control and quality assurance 
processes , which was identified as “c ritical to the successful execution of the approach 
Mobomo presents []”; and (3) o versee documentation of the website’s architecture and 
configurations as well as project processes , a requirement for PWS tasks 1 and 3.  Id.; 
see also PWS at  14. 
 Mobomo contends these findings are in error.  Indeed, the protester argues while its proposed w eb project manager/ scrum master ’s “resume does not use the exact words 
called out in the Re- Evaluation  Summary, a complete review of his resume 
demonstrates [he] has experience with each  of these three responsibilities .”  Protest 
at 40.  In this regard, Mobomo argues the key person’s experience managing a Drupal 
upgrade, oversight of daily scrums, experience using a process implementation indicator description (PI ID) to monitor project health, and maintenance of CMMI -
compliant documentation satisfy the PWS requirements.  2nd Supp. Comments at 34-41.   
 Our Office has consistently stated that it is a vendor’s responsibility  to submit a well -
written quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. Inc. , supra  at 5.  
A vendor  risks having its quotation evaluated unfavorably where it fails to submit an 
adequately written quotation.   Id.   
 On this record, we find no evidence to suggest the agency’s evaluation conclusions were unreasonable.  For example, concerning the web project manager’s leading a Drupal upgrade, as explained by the TET chair in his declaration, “ software upgrade  
risk management and continuous risk management are related but different in scope and application.”  TET Chair Dec. at 6.  Thus, “[m] anaging a Drupal upgrade can 
demonstrate some aspects  of risk management experience, but that experience alone 
does not fully  demonstrate risk management ” because “[r]isk  management is an 
ongoing, structured process. ”  Id.  Similarly, while Mobomo argues the key person’s 
experience overseeing daily scrum meetings demonstrates oversight of quality  Page 13 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  control/assurance processes, the TET disagreed.  The TET chair explains scrum 
meetings “can help surface quality -related issues and improve communication between 
developers and testers,  [but] they do not constitute [quality control/assurance] 
oversight. ”  Id.  We find reasonable the agency’s evaluation conclusions; Mobomo’s 
disagreement, without more, provides no basis to sustain the protest.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2. 
 Exchanges  
 Following its initial evaluation of quotations, NOAA, having determined that ResolveSoft was the apparent successful vendor, entered into exchanges with the firm.  See  RFQ 
at 64 (“Once the Government determines the contractor that is the best -suited ( i.e., the 
apparent  successful contractor), the Government reserves the right to communicate 
with only that contractor to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a 
task order with that contractor. ”).  The agency sought clarification concerning w here 
certain subscription and hosting platform costs were included in ResolveSoft’s price quotation.  Supp. COS at 10- 11.  ResolveSoft submitted a revised pricing quotation in 
response, resulting in an increase in price of approximately $[DELETED].  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 10.  Following Mobomo’s initial protest, NOAA, as part of its corrective action, conducted a reevaluation of quotations, but did not engage in any additional exchanges with either the protester or ResolveSoft.  Id.   
 The protester challenges the agency’s failure to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as part of its corrective action.  Mobomo agrees that NOAA was, consistent with the solicitation, permitted to conduct exchanges with ResolveSoft following the best suited 
determination made as part the initial evaluation of quotations.  However, the protester contends that once the agency agreed to undertake a new evaluation of quotations, “ResolveSoft was no longer the apparent awardee” and “[a]t that stage, the Agency was 
required to conduct leveling discussions with Mobomo to allow quotes to be evaluated 
on an equal basis .”  Comments and Supp. Protest at 4.  In this regard, Mobomo argues 
NOAA’s exchanges with ResolveSoft constituted discussions, and such “ one-sided 
discussions tainted the reevaluation” because “ NOAA permitted  ResolveSoft to address 
weaknesses identified by the Agency and submit a revised quote without  affording 
Mobomo the opportunity to do the same.”  Id. at 6.  See also Supp. Comments at 5- 9.  
In response, the agency contends its decision to engage in exchanges with ResolveSoft was reasonable, or, in the alternative, Mobomo suffered no competitive prejudice as a result of NOAA’s failure to enter into exchanges with the protester.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MO L) at 2- 5. 
 Where an agency chooses to conduct exchanges with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, the exchanges, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance in makin g this determination.  Aurotech, Inc. , B-413861.4, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 205 
at 10.  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as “limited exchanges” that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this 
case, quotations), or to resolve minor clerical mistakes.  See FAR 15.306(a)(1),(2); Sky  Page 14 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Solutions, LLC , B-421139.2, B -421139.3, June 30, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 184 at 6.  In 
contrast, under FAR part 15, discussions occur when an agency communicates with an 
offeror for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determining the acceptability of a proposal or quotation or provides the offeror with an opportunity to revise or modify its proposal or quotation.  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches, Inc. , B-418823.3, 
B-418823.4, Jan.  8, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 18 at 8.  
 We have previously resolved protests involving similarly worded solicitation provisions that allowed an agency to address any issues, including technical or price, only with the best-suited contractor, including in FAR subpart 8.4 procurements.  See, e.g., A Square 
Grp., LLC , B-421792.5, Apr. 11, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶  95 at 7 (denying protest ground 
alleging that the agency conducted unequal discussions pursuant to a similar solicitation provision in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement); Sky Solutions, LLC , supra at 6-7 (same); 
see also VariQ -CV JV, LLC, B -418551, B -418551.3, June 15, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  196 
at 18-20 (denying a similar challenge in a FAR subpart 16.5 procurement).  In those 
decisions, which were protests challenging an agency’s conduct of exchanges, we denied protest grounds alleging the agency conducted unequal discussions primarily on 
the basis that the agency’s actions in holding exchanges were consistent with the terms of the solicitation, while also noting that the procurements at issue were conducted under FAR procedures other than those found at FA R part 15.  See Sky Solutions , LLC, 
supra at 7; VariQ -CV JV, LLC, supra at 20.   
 Mobomo’s protest presents a novel factual scenario.   That is, rather than a challenge to 
the propriety of exchanges with ResolveSoft following the agency’s initial evaluation, the protester contends the agency was required to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as 
part of its corrective action, so to place the two firms on an equal competitive footing for the reevaluation.   Here, on this record, we conclude that Mobomo cannot demonstrate it 
was competitively prejudiced by the agency’s conduct.   See, e.g., Interfor US, Inc., 
B-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD ¶ 19 at 7 (“Competitive prejudice is an essential 
element of every viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a protest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency’s actions arguably were improper.”).  
 Several facts in the record lead us to this conclusion.   First, we note that the parties are 
seemingly in agreement that the solicitation permitted the exchanges NOAA engaged in with ResolveSoft, as the apparent awardee, following the agency’s initial eval uation.   
See Supp. MOL at 2- 4; Supp. Comments at 6- 7.  Second,  the record demonstrates that 
ResolveSoft, as a result of those exchanges, made changes to its pricing volume, but did not make changes to its technical quotation.  See  AR, Tab  24, ADD at 10.  I ndeed, 
the agency’s technical reevaluation was unaffected as a result of those pricing changes.  Third, the record demonstrates that both after the agency’s initial evaluation of 
quotations, and after its reevaluation following its decision to take corrective action in response to Mobomo’s initial protest, ResolveSoft was determined to be the best -suited 
vendor .  Id.  That is, the status quo ante prior to the agency’s undertaking corrective 
action remained in effect; ResolveSoft endured as the best -suited v endor  even at a 
higher price.   Finally, and as discussed more fully above, we find no basis to object to  Page 15 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  the agency’s reevaluation conclusions, to include NOAA’s evaluation of vendors’ 
technical quotations, or  that ResolveSoft’s quotation was technically superior to 
Mobomo’s quotation.  
 Under these unique facts, Mobomo cannot reasonably demonstrate it was prejudiced by 
the agency’s conduct .  Mobomo was not the best -suited vendor  following the initial 
evaluation, nor was it the best -suited vendor  following the agency’s reevaluation.  Id.  
Thus, under the established terms of the solicitation, Mobomo was not eligible for exchanges with NOAA.   See Sky Solutions , supra at 7 (denying protest on basis that 
agency, having determined the awardee was the best -suited vendor, reasonably 
entered into exchanges with the firm).  Moreover, as the protester acknowledges, our 
Office’s decisions explain an agency may conduct exchanges solely with the best -suited 
vendor  so long as the agency “reasonably and fairly” evaluates vendors’ quotations.  
Comments at 6 (citing S2 Analytical Sols., LLC, B -422281.3, Dec. 20, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 312 at 3).    
 Again, as developed more fully, above, we find reasonable the agency’s underlying 
evaluation of quotations.   And finally, ResolveSoft, through exchanges, made no 
alterations to its technical quotation, and the firm’s pricing changes had no impact on the underlying merits of the agency’s reevaluation or tradeoff decision.  AR, Tab 24, 
ADD at 10.  In sum:  Resolv eSoft’s initial quotation was evaluated as technically 
superior; the exchanges had no bearing on ResolveSoft’s technical quotation and were limited t o a single issue, resulting in a net increase to the awardee’s proposed price; 
and ResolveSoft’s unchanged, initial non- price quotation was confirmed as technically 
superior following the agency’s reevaluation.  On this specific record, we find no basis to 
sustain the protest allegation.  
 The protest is denied.

DIGEST  
 1. Protest challenging the agency ’s evaluation of quotations  is denied where the 
evaluation was reasonable, even- handed, and consistent with the stated evaluation 
criteria.  2. Protest contending the agency’s failure, as part of its corrective action, to engage in exchanges with the protester constituted unequal discussions is denied where the agency’s conduct was consistent with the terms of the solicitation and the protester  
cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice.  
DECISION  
 Mobomo LLC, a small business of Gaithersburg, Maryland, protests the issuance of an order to ResolveSoft Inc., a small business of Elkridge, Maryland, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 1305M324Q0367, issued by the Department of Commerce, 
National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for web modernization and 
maintenance services.  The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of quotations and conduct of exchanges . 
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on August 9, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4 (Federal Supply Schedules), to small DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  business firms holding the General Services Administration’s (GSA) multiple- award 
federal supply schedule (FSS) contract for information technology professional services.  
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFQ at 1- 3.1  
The RFQ contemplated the issuance of a single order, with a 6- month phase -in period, 
a 1-year base period of performance and two 1- year option periods.  RFQ at 1- 3.  
NOAA sought support services to  maintain and enhance the National Marine Fisheries 
Service flagship website,  www. fisheries.noaa.gov .  AR, Tab 4, Performance Work 
Statement (PWS) at 4.  
The solicitation advised that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, 
considering three non- price factors:  (1)  technical approach; (2) staffing and 
management approach/key personnel; and (3) experience.  RFQ at 65.  The RFQ 
explained that the non- price factors were of equal importance and, when combined, 
were significantly more important than price.  Id . at 64- 65.  NOAA would apply one of 
three adjectival confidence ratings for each of the non- price evaluation factors:  high 
confidence; some confidence; and low confidence.  Id . at 65.   
 Under the technical approach factor, quotations would be evaluated “ to assess the 
degree to which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound 
approach to, and experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this 
solicitation. ”  Id. at 65.  While the staffing and management approach/key personnel 
factor would similarly be evaluated to assess whether the vendor “demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, and experience to successfully  perform 
the [RFQ’s] requirements [,]” the agency would also evaluate “the strength of  the 
proposed key personnel including education and professional certifications/credentials ” 
and “ the currency, quality and depth of experience of the proposed key personnel  
working on similar projects. ”  Id.   
 
Under the experience factor, NOAA would “determine the recency and relevancy based 
on similar size, scope, and magnitude to the PWS” and “evaluate the quality, depth and degree of the quoter’s experience.”  Id.  The RFQ further explained that “ the quoter’s 
experience will be evaluated to assess the Government’s  level of confidence of its 
demonstrated experience with platforms, systems, methodology, and software identified 
in the PWS, or similarly related technology, including, but not limited to, Acquia Drupal
2 
[platform as a service (PaaS)] , Akamai [web application firewall (WAF)/content delivery 
network (CDN)] , Agile/Scrum methodology, [user experience ( UX)]- driven design and 
development, and data- driven decision making. ”  Id.  Price would be evaluated for 
completeness and reasonableness.  Id. at 66.

RFP at 64.  Specifically, the solicitation explained:  
 
Once the Government determines the contractor that is the best -suited 
(i.e., the apparent  successful contractor), the Government reserves the 
right to communicate with only that contractor to  address any remaining 
issues, if necessary, and finalize a task order with that contractor.  These 
issues  may include t echnical/staffing/management/key personnel and 
price, as well as increasing or decreasing the level of effort and/or 
requirements due to funding availability and changes to the period of  
performance at  the Government’s discretion.    
 Id. 
 The agency received timely submitted quotations from three vendors, including from Mobomo and ResolveSoft.  COS at 6.  Following its evaluation, NOAA identified ResolveSoft as the best -suited vendor and entered into exchanges with 
the firm.  COS at 7.  Through these exchanges, ResolveSoft upwardly revised its price quotation.  AR, Tab 17, Exchanges with ResolveSoft at  1; AR, Tab 28, 
ResolveSoft Pricing Revisions at 2.  NOAA issued the order to ResolveSoft on September 19.  COS at 8.  
 Mobomo filed a protest with our Office on October 3, challenging NOAA’s evaluation of quotations.  On October 15, our Office dismissed Mobomo’s protest as academic, based on the agency’s stated intention to undertake corrective 
action; NOAA explained it wo uld “re- evaluate the quotes it received in response 
to the solicitation and subsequently issue a new source selection decision.”  
Mobomo LLC , B-423027, Oct. 15, 2024 (unpublished decision).   
 In implementing its corrective action, NOAA undertook a reevaluation of quotations, resulting in the following ratings for Mobomo’s and ResolveSoft’s quotations:  
 
 Mobomo  ResolveSoft  
Technical Approach  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  
Staffing and Management 
Approach/Key Personnel  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  
Experience  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  
Total Evaluated Price  $11,030,164  $11,470,934  
 AR, Tab 24, Corrective Action Award Decision Document (ADD) at 12. 
 NOAA found ResolveSoft ’s quotation to represent the best value to the agency, 
“considering its technically superior approach, senior key personnel, and extensive 
experience. ”  Id. at 16.  The agency further explained that “ResolveSoft’s quote offers a 
technically superior, low risk option compared to Mobomo, and the technically superior  Page 4 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  features . . . are worth the slight price premium associated with ResolveSoft’s quote. ”  
Id.  NOAA issued the task order to ResolveSoft  on or about February 26, 2025.  COS 
at 14.  Mobomo filed the instant protest on March 10.  
 
DISCUSSION  Mobomo marshals several challenges to the agency’s conduct of the procurement.  In this regard, the protester contends the agency’s evaluation of its quotation across the non-price factors was flawed, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the terms of the 
solicitation.  Specifically, Mobomo argues NOAA improperly identified a number of 
quotation features that decreased the agency’s confidence that the firm could successfully perform the contract and applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Moreover, the protest er asserts the evaluation was unequal, where NOAA applied a much harsher 
standard to its review of Mobomo’s quotation as compared to ResolveSoft’s quotation.  The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate quotations in a manner  consistent with the RFQ’s evaluation scheme.  Additionally, the protester 
argues the agency erred by not also engaging in exchanges with Mobomo.  For the reasons that follow, we find no basis to sustain the protest.

 Technical Evaluation  
 Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and 
conducts a competition for the issuance of an order or establishment of a blanket purchase agreement , we will review the record to ensure that the agency ’s evaluation 
 
3 Mobomo raises other collateral allegations, and although our decision does not 
specifically address every argument presented, we have considered each argument and find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.   For example, under the 
staffing and management approach/key personnel factor, vendors were required to “explain how the proposed labor categories from its  GSA Schedule contract are 
equivalent to the labor categories specified in the PWS  in terms of position 
duties/responsibilities and qualifications[.]”  RFQ at 60.  The protester argues the agency improperly concluded that Mobomo’s proposed labor categories and corresponding qualifications referenced in its quotation “are not fully equivalent to the required qualifications outlined in the PWS [.]”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 6.   
However, based on our review of the record, we find reasonable the agency’s evaluation findings.  Indeed, it is not immediately ascertainable from the chart in the protester’s quotation whether the positions cited in the evaluation report do, in fact, meet  the minimum requirements as established in the PWS.  Compare AR, Tab 10, 
Mobomo Technical Quotation at 19- 21 (Mobomo’s crosswalk with identified 
qualifications), with PWS at 15 -19 (requiring specific levels of education and/or 
experience for each position).  It is a vendor ’s responsibility to submit  a well- written 
quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. Inc. , B-422351, Apr. 25,

B-400777, Jan. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 33 at 4.  A protester ’s disagreement with the 
agency ’s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was 
unreasonable.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2.   
 We have reviewed each of Mobomo’s  arguments concerning the agency ’s evaluation 
under the non- price  factors , and, as reflected in the following representative examples, 
we find no basis to sustain the protes t.  
 First, Mobomo challenges the agency’s assessment of items that decreased the agency’s confidence in the protester’s quotation under the technical approach factor.  Relevant here, the technical approach factor was to be “ evaluated to assess the degree 
to which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, 
and experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation. ”  
RFQ at 65.  Both vendors were assigned a “some confidence” rating under this factor.  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  For Mobomo’s quotation, while NOAA found 
several technical features that increased the agency’s confidence of successful performance, NOAA found five elements that were identified to decrease the agency’s confidence, al l of which Mobomo challenges in this protest.  
 As one example, under the PWS’s project management task (task 1), the successful vendor will be expected to, among other things, “[m]anage software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to existing systems or processes. ”  PWS at  6.  In 
its evaluation, the agency stated that Mobomo’s quotation “ does not address a strategy 
or method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions [.]”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The protester finds fault with the 
agency’s  conclusions, contending its quotation did manifest a cogent strategy for 
software upgrades with little disruption.  Protest at 24- 25; Comments and Supp. Protest 
at 18- 20; 2nd Supp. Comments at 16- 17.
4  Specifically, Mobomo points to its four -
phased risk management plan, use of the Jira software application for software upgrade tracking and documentation, and its use of continuous integration and deployment.  See  
AR, Tab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 8- 10.   
 However, the agency disagrees that these features, and Mobomo’s overall plan, were sufficiently detailed to warrant a different evaluation finding.  The technical evaluation team (TET) chair provided a declaration to support the agency’s findings, in which he 
 
4 Following briefing on Mobomo’s supplemental protest allegation, our Office asked for 
additional briefing from the parties.  Electronic Protest Docketing System (EPDS) No. 24.  We refer to this round of briefing as the “2nd. Supplemental.”   Page 6 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  noted that the protester’s plan lacked specificity.  TET Chair Dec. at 2.  For example, 
with respect to its four -phased risk management plan, the TET chair explains that 
Mobomo’s plan is “simply too high -level” and does not sufficiently describe how 
Mobomo’s approach would minimize disruptions.  Id .  Similarly, with respect to 
continuous integration and development, the TET chair provides that while these are important tools, these “primarily focus on code quality and security, not on ensuring a smooth and disruption- free upgrade. ”  Id. 
 Moreover, with respect to Mobomo’s use of Jira, the TET chair explains that this web-based tool is essentially a service request tracking notebook.  Id .  But, while “[t] aking 
notes is necessary to do, ” the TET chair provides that reliance on Jira “ is a lackluster 
response to this requirement ” because it is not wholly responsive to meet the agency’s 
need, nor was its use explained with sufficient detail with respect to minimizing disruptions.  Id . at 2 -3.  Mobomo disagrees with the TET’s assessment; in the 
protester’s view, “ Jira is not just  a web- based tracking tool; rather, it is a project 
management platform used for  quality assurance.”  2nd Supp. Comments at  15-16.  In 
this regard, the protester’s protest submissions argue that Jira represents a multi -step 
process that “ensures quality and minimizes disruptions during software upgrades.”  Id. 
at 16.    However, given the lack of these supporting details presented in Mobomo’s quotation (rather than as further explained in the protester’s briefs during this protest), we cannot conclude the agency’s evaluation determinations are unreasonable.  Compare AR, 
Tab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 9 (noting only the use Jira to “track, monitor, 
and plan for software upgrades, minimizing disruption to existing systems and ensuring 
timely updates ”) with 2nd Supp. Comments at 15- 17 (providing significant detail on how 
Jira would be utilized for software upgrades).  As addressed above, it is a vendor’s responsibility to submit a quotation with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. , 
supra.  To the extent Mobomo’s protest submissions attempt to more clearly articulate its proposed technical approach, our review is limited to the quotation, as submitted, as contracting agencies are not responsible for evaluating information that is  not included 
in a quotation.  Patriot Def. Grp., LLC , B-418720.3, Aug.  5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 265 at 9.  
 Second, Mobomo also suggests NOAA’s evaluation conclusions under the technical approach factor reflect unequal treatment among vendors, where the agency applied exacting scrutiny to the protester’s quotation yet acted with insouciance when it came to Resol veSoft’s alleged lack of similar detail.  That is, to prevail on an allegation of 
disparate treatment, a protester must show that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation in a different manner than another quotation that was substantively indistinguishable or nearly identical.  CGI Fed., Inc. , B-423041 et al. , Jan.13, 2025, 
2025 CPD ¶ 26 at 12.  
 As one example of alleged unequal treatment, Mobomo points to NOAA’s acceptance of the alleged mere mention of the use of Jira in ResolveSoft’s quotation but required significant detailed explanations when it came to Mobomo’s use of Jira.  2nd Supp.  Page 7 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Comments at  16.  The protester’s comparison is inapposite.  To this point, the record 
reflects that NOAA found benefit in ResolveSoft’s overall quality control and assurance 
(task 3) plan, to include its approach to “defect tracking”, where the awardee explained it would “use Jira for defect tracking, linking defects to user stories to reduce recurrence 
by [DELETED] [percent].”  AR, Tab 14, ResolveSoft Technical Quotation at 12; see also 
AR, Tab  23, Evaluation Report at 9 (explaining several features of Res olveSoft’s 
quotation that increased confidence in successful performance, to include that the firm’s quotation “ mentions using Jira for defect tracking, ensuring that defects are linked to 
user stories to reduce recurrence by [DELETED] [percent]” which “ highlights a 
structured approach to defect documentation and issue tracking. ”).   
 On the other hand, the agency faulted Mobomo’s quotation because while it also proposed to use Jira, the protester failed to explain how such use would allow for the management of “ software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to 
existing systems or processes ” as required under PWS task  1.  PWS at  6; see also TET 
Chair Dec. at 2- 3 (explaining that Jira is primarily a tool for service tracking as opposed 
to implementation).  Thus, the agency credited the awardee for its proposed use of Jira in connection with defect tracking under PWS task 3, while awarding a weakness for the 
protester’s failure to adequately explain the use of the tool in connection with management of software upgrades under PWS task 1; the differences in the agency’s evaluati on reasonably stem from differences in the quotations.  
 Similarly, the protester’s argument of disparate treatment concerning the vendors’ capability maturity model integration (CMMI) level 3 certifications fails to provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.
5  Mobomo contends NOAA relied on this certification to 
“mitigate” a weakness assigned to ResolveSoft, yet did not do so for a “similar” weakness assigned to the protester’s quotation.  As an initial matter, the record reflects the CMMI certification was fo und to increase confidence of successful performance for 
both Mobomo and ResolveSoft.
6  Notwithstanding that both vendors were positively 
credited for the same quotation feature, the protester complains that it was unreasonable for the agency to also address the awardee’s certification as helping to mitigate an assessed weakness, while not similarly mentioning the protester’s certification as helping to mitigate one of the protester’s assessed weaknesses.  2nd 
 
5 The CMMI Institute appraises organizations at levels from 0 to 5 to characterize that 
organization’s capability and performance.  See https://cmmiinstitute.com/learning/ 
appraisals/levels  (last visited May 26, 2025).  The CMMI institute characterizes maturity 
level 3 as “proactive rather than reactive” where “[o]rganization- wide standards provide 
guidance across projects, programs, and portfolios.”  Id . 
6 Specifically, both offerors received nearly identical strengths because NOAA 
concluded that CMMI level 3 practices meant “the vendor has an organizational approach to development practices, which is relevant for project management and risk management (PWS  Task 1), technical solutions (Task 2), quality assurance and 
requirements management (PWS Task 3), and product integration (PWS Task 5).”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  Thus, the record reflects that both offerors were similarly positively credited for their respective CMMI certifications.  Page 8 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Supp. Comments at 17- 18.  However, to whatever extent the record suggests that the 
agency considered ResolveSoft’s CMMI level 3 certification, in this regard, it also makes 
clear that both offerors were similarly assessed weaknesses for providing inadequat e 
detail in their responses to the PWS task 1 requirements, thus negating any alleged “unequal” treatment.  
 Specifically, Mobomo received a weakness because its quotation did “not address a strategy or method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions (PWS Task 1).”  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The record reflects that ResolveSoft similarly received a weakness for its failure to provide adequate details 
with respect to managing project risks under PWS task 1.  Id. at 9.  Although the 
awardee was positively evaluated based on its “comprehensive and carefully planned” approach to project management and its approach to planning and task decomposition, 
the agency noted concern with the lack of adequate detail in the awardee’s plan to “identify risks, minimize the impact of unforeseen issues, respond to outages, or manage s oftware upgrades.”  Id.  at 8-10.  The TET explained that ResolveSoft’s CMMI 
level 3 certification “indicates the use of processes that support effective risk management,” and the quotation otherwise provided some software upgrade details under PWS task  7.  Id. at 10.   
 Fatal to the protester’s argument, however, is that notwithstanding the foregoing potential mitigating points, the TET nevertheless assigned a weakness to ResolveSoft’s quotation, specifically explaining that “[t]he omission from Task 1 decreases the Gover nment’s confidence that Team ResolveSoft can effectively manage project risks 
with minimal intervention.”  Id. at 10.  Accordingly, to whatever degree the agency 
considered the awardee’s CMMI certification, it nevertheless assigned a weakness to the awarde e’s quotation.  Thus, where both vendors were positively assessed for 
possessing CMMI certifications, and neither offeror avoided an adverse evaluation finding as a result of their certifications, the record fails to demonstrate that the agency’s evaluation was unequal.  
 Next, Mobomo argues the agency, in contravention of the terms of the RFQ, failed to reasonably consider “experience” in its evaluation of vendors’ offered technical approaches under the first evaluation factor.  See Protest at 37- 38; 2nd Supp. 
Comments at  27-28.  As noted above, under the technical approach factor, a vendor’s 
“overall technical approach will be evaluated to assess the degree to which the quote 
demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, and experience to 
successfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation.” (emphasis added).  
This evaluation factor was distinct from the third evaluation factor, which specifically evaluated vendors’ prior experience.  RFQ at 65.  The protester contends NOAA, in its evaluation under the technical approach factor, overlooked the firm’s “unmatched track record in performing the RFQ requirements on behalf of NOAA under the incumbent  
contract [,]” as well as its high marks for such performance in the Contractor 
Performance Assessment  Reporting System (CPARS), and in turn failed to consider 
ResolveSoft’s alleged lack of relevant federal experience.  Protest at 37.  The protester’s arguments unreasonably characterize the agency’s contemporaneous  Page 9 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  evaluation record, which demonstrates that the agency reasonably considered offerors’ 
relevant experience as part of the technical approach factor.  
 Relevant here, the contemporaneous evaluation record unquestionably demonstrates that the agency, consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation scheme, considered vendors’ respective experience as part of the technical approach evaluation.  Specifically, t he agency identified three aspects of Mobomo’s prior experience that 
increased the agency’s confidence under the technical approach factor, including:  
 
• As the incumbent, Mobomo has an understanding of and significant experience with NOAA Fisheries’ processes, priorities, and organizational structure and the websites’ infrastructure, codebase, 
and policies. . . .  
 
• Mobomo’s status as a Drupal Certified Partner, Acquia Community 
Partner, and member of the [Amazon Web Services] Partner Network 
increases the Government’s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, dev ops, and 
performance monitoring. . . .  
 
• Mobomo’s experience with Drupal’s multilingual modules and 
integrating third- party translation services increases the Government’s 
confidence that they can successfully execute PWS Task 6 requirements related to page translations if the Government chooses to carry out that optional special project.  
 AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  
 For ResolveSoft, the agency positively noted that:  “Team ResolveSoft’s bench of Acquia - and Drupal -certified developers and 20+ years of Drupal development 
experience increases the Government’s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, devops, and performance monitoring.”  Id. at 9. 
 Thus, the record demonstrates that --separate and apart from the evaluation of vendors’ 
respective experience under the experience evaluation factor --the agency also 
reasonably considered vendors’ respective relevant experience under the technical approach factor.  To the extent that the protester raises additional discrete challenges to 
the agency’s evaluation of experience, we find no merit to those arguments.  
 For example, notwithstanding that the agency positively credited Mobomo for its incumbent experience under the technical approach factor (as noted above), the protester suggests that such a strength should have been afforded considerably more significance.   We disagree.  We have consistently explained that there is no 
requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or  Page 10 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent contractor.  Tuknik 
Gov’t Servs., LLC , B-422862.2, Dec. 30, 2024, 2025 CPD ¶ 17 at  4. 
 Similarly, the protester’s allegation that ResolveSoft should have been downgraded for not having relevant federal experience fails to establish a basis on which to sustain the protest.  Nothing in the technical approach factor limited experience only to r elevant 
federal  experience; rather, the agency was only to evaluate proffered experience to the 
extent it demonstrated the offeror’s ability to successfully perform  the requirements 
stated within the solicitation .  See RFQ at 65.  Given the commercial nature of the 
software at issue, it was not unreasonable for the agency to consider an offeror’s general experience working with the software or platforms, regardless of whether the customer was a government or commercial entity.  In this regard, the experienc e 
evaluation factor specifically allowed for the submission of references for work performed for government agencies or commercial entities, and noted that in terms of relevance, the government was particularly interested in “the quoter’s demonstrated experience with platforms, systems, methodology, and software identified in the PWS, or similarly related technology, including, but not limited to, Acquia Drupal PaaS, Akamai WAF/CDN, Agile/Scrum methodology, UX -driven design and development, and 
data- driven decision making.”  RFQ at 60.  The protester does not offer any reason why 
the relevancy considerations for the technical approach factor should be read more restrictively than the relevancy requirements set forth under the experience evaluation factor.  
 As a final example of its challenges under the technical approach factor, the protester argues the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria where NOAA unreasonably 
inflated the importance of PWS task 3 (quality control and quality assurance) and task 5 (user experience, usability, design, and content support) in its evaluation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at 8- 14; Supp. Comments at 9- 14; 2nd Supp. Comments at 29- 34.  In 
this regard, Mobomo contends that the RFQ did not provide for giving more weight to different tasks in the agency’s evaluation yet the agency’s best -value decision elevated 
tasks 3 and 5 above all others, which fundamentally skewed NOAA’s selection decision.  Id.  Mobomo points to a specific portion of the agency’s award decision in support of its 
argument:  
 
As the incumbent, Mobomo brings institutional knowledge and experience with [agency]  processes, priorities, and organizational structure, as well as 
the website’s infrastructure, codebase, and policies.  However, the current 
requirement expands on and introduces requirements intended to enhance both service quality (user experience, website performance, and reliability) and product quality (code integrity, feature functionality, and technical performance),  which differ from the previous contract supported 
by Mobomo and reflect the project’s more advanced state.  It is in meeting 
these requirements that Mobomo is inferior to the other vendor.  
 AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13- 14. 
  Page 11 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement that an agency must evaluate 
quotations consistent with the terms of the solicitation and, while the evaluation of vendors’ quotations generally is a matter within the procuring agency’s discretion, our Office will question an agency’s evaluation where it is unreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria, or undocumented.   Tantus Techs., Inc. , 
B-411608, B -411608.3, Sept. 14, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 299 at 6.   
 Contrary to the protester’s contention, the record does not support Mobomo’s assertion regarding the unfair weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 in the agency’s evaluation under the technical approach factor.  First, the technical evaluation demonstrates the agency considered the positive and negative aspects of both vendors’ quotations across all the PWS task areas.  See, e.g.,  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3 -4, 9-10.  Second, the 
record evidences that the source selection authority did highlight Mobomo’s deficiencies, as compared to ResolveSoft, specifically with regard to elements of PWS 
tasks 3 and 5.  See e.g.,  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13 (noting that Mobomo’s “ technical 
approach lacked clarity and details in several key aspects of the PWS, specifically in [tasks 3 and 5].”).   
 However, the same paragraph cited by the protester as confirmation of impermissible weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 also highlights Mobomo’s shortcomings in another PWS area, task 1 (project management).  Id . (identifying Mobomo’s quotation as lacking 
detail in how it would handle defect recurrence).  Thus, the record does not support a contention that NOAA was exclusively concerned with PWS tasks 3 and 5.  Third, and most relevant to our analysis, the mere f act that a source selection authority finds 
discri minators in some, but not all, of the evaluated tasks does not equate to the 
agency’s consideration of those specific tasks above all others.  Indeed, in a best -value 
procurement, particularly where technical factors are more important than price, an agenc y may focus on a particular discriminator, and merely highlighting a specific 
aspect of a quotation in the selection decision does not, by itself, render the evaluation unreasonable.  See, e.g.,  SGT, Inc., B -405736,  B-405736.2 Dec. 27, 2011, 2012 CPD

¶ 223 at 12- 13.  
 Next, turning to the agency’s evaluation under the staffing and management approach/key personnel factor, Mobomo challenges NOAA’s evaluation of its key personnel, arguing the agency unreasonably found that the resumes for all three of the firm’s key perso ns failed to demonstrate experience in several key PWS areas.  Protest 
at 39-48; Comments and Supp. Protest at 26- 32; Supp. Comments at 17- 18; 2nd Supp. 
Comments at 34- 59.  Again, based upon our review of the record, we find nothing 
unreasonable with the agency’s evaluation.  We address one representative example, below.  
 Vendors were required to submit resumes for three identified key persons:  (1) a w eb 
project manager/ scrum master ; (2) l ead developer/ technical architect ; and (3) digital 
product analyst/UX researcher .  RFQ at 13, 59- 60.  NOAA would evaluate, among other 
things, “ the strength of  the proposed key personnel including education and  Page 12 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  professional certifications/credentials ” as well as “ the currency, quality and depth of 
experience of the proposed key personnel  working on similar projects. ”  RFQ at 65.  For 
each identified key personnel position, the PWS provided a bullet point list of primary 
responsibilities.  See e.g., PWS at  14 (identifying 13 core areas the web project 
manager/scrum master would perform).   
 The agency’s evaluation found several aspects of Mobomo’s proposed web project manager/scrum master that increase NOAA’s confidence in successful performance of the contract.  See AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 4 (identifying several positive 
aspects of the web project manager’s resume and experience relevant to the subject PWS).  However, the evaluators also found that the web project manager’s resume did not demonstrate “ experience in three responsibilities of the role that are important to the 
success of project requirements and goals [.]”  Id. at 5.  Specifically, the TET explained 
that the project manager/scrum master did not demonstrate experience to:  (1) m onitor 
and manage project risks throughout the development process , which “ directly relates to 
risk management requirements ”; (2) o versee quality control and quality assurance 
processes , which was identified as “c ritical to the successful execution of the approach 
Mobomo presents []”; and (3) o versee documentation of the website’s architecture and 
configurations as well as project processes , a requirement for PWS tasks 1 and 3.  Id.; 
see also PWS at  14. 
 Mobomo contends these findings are in error.  Indeed, the protester argues while its proposed w eb project manager/ scrum master ’s “resume does not use the exact words 
called out in the Re- Evaluation  Summary, a complete review of his resume 
demonstrates [he] has experience with each  of these three responsibilities .”  Protest 
at 40.  In this regard, Mobomo argues the key person’s experience managing a Drupal 
upgrade, oversight of daily scrums, experience using a process implementation indicator description (PI ID) to monitor project health, and maintenance of CMMI -
compliant documentation satisfy the PWS requirements.  2nd Supp. Comments at 34-41.   
 Our Office has consistently stated that it is a vendor’s responsibility  to submit a well -
written quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. Inc. , supra  at 5.  
A vendor  risks having its quotation evaluated unfavorably where it fails to submit an 
adequately written quotation.   Id.   
 On this record, we find no evidence to suggest the agency’s evaluation conclusions were unreasonable.  For example, concerning the web project manager’s leading a Drupal upgrade, as explained by the TET chair in his declaration, “ software upgrade  
risk management and continuous risk management are related but different in scope and application.”  TET Chair Dec. at 6.  Thus, “[m] anaging a Drupal upgrade can 
demonstrate some aspects  of risk management experience, but that experience alone 
does not fully  demonstrate risk management ” because “[r]isk  management is an 
ongoing, structured process. ”  Id.  Similarly, while Mobomo argues the key person’s 
experience overseeing daily scrum meetings demonstrates oversight of quality  Page 13 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  control/assurance processes, the TET disagreed.  The TET chair explains scrum 
meetings “can help surface quality -related issues and improve communication between 
developers and testers,  [but] they do not constitute [quality control/assurance] 
oversight. ”  Id.  We find reasonable the agency’s evaluation conclusions; Mobomo’s 
disagreement, without more, provides no basis to sustain the protest.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2. 
 Exchanges  
 Following its initial evaluation of quotations, NOAA, having determined that ResolveSoft was the apparent successful vendor, entered into exchanges with the firm.  See  RFQ 
at 64 (“Once the Government determines the contractor that is the best -suited ( i.e., the 
apparent  successful contractor), the Government reserves the right to communicate 
with only that contractor to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a 
task order with that contractor. ”).  The agency sought clarification concerning w here 
certain subscription and hosting platform costs were included in ResolveSoft’s price quotation.  Supp. COS at 10- 11.  ResolveSoft submitted a revised pricing quotation in 
response, resulting in an increase in price of approximately $[DELETED].  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 10.  Following Mobomo’s initial protest, NOAA, as part of its corrective action, conducted a reevaluation of quotations, but did not engage in any additional exchanges with either the protester or ResolveSoft.  Id.   
 The protester challenges the agency’s failure to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as part of its corrective action.  Mobomo agrees that NOAA was, consistent with the solicitation, permitted to conduct exchanges with ResolveSoft following the best suited 
determination made as part the initial evaluation of quotations.  However, the protester contends that once the agency agreed to undertake a new evaluation of quotations, “ResolveSoft was no longer the apparent awardee” and “[a]t that stage, the Agency was 
required to conduct leveling discussions with Mobomo to allow quotes to be evaluated 
on an equal basis .”  Comments and Supp. Protest at 4.  In this regard, Mobomo argues 
NOAA’s exchanges with ResolveSoft constituted discussions, and such “ one-sided 
discussions tainted the reevaluation” because “ NOAA permitted  ResolveSoft to address 
weaknesses identified by the Agency and submit a revised quote without  affording 
Mobomo the opportunity to do the same.”  Id. at 6.  See also Supp. Comments at 5- 9.  
In response, the agency contends its decision to engage in exchanges with ResolveSoft was reasonable, or, in the alternative, Mobomo suffered no competitive prejudice as a result of NOAA’s failure to enter into exchanges with the protester.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MO L) at 2- 5. 
 Where an agency chooses to conduct exchanges with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, the exchanges, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance in makin g this determination.  Aurotech, Inc. , B-413861.4, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 205 
at 10.  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as “limited exchanges” that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this 
case, quotations), or to resolve minor clerical mistakes.  See FAR 15.306(a)(1),(2); Sky  Page 14 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Solutions, LLC , B-421139.2, B -421139.3, June 30, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 184 at 6.  In 
contrast, under FAR part 15, discussions occur when an agency communicates with an 
offeror for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determining the acceptability of a proposal or quotation or provides the offeror with an opportunity to revise or modify its proposal or quotation.  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches, Inc. , B-418823.3, 
B-418823.4, Jan.  8, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 18 at 8.  
 We have previously resolved protests involving similarly worded solicitation provisions that allowed an agency to address any issues, including technical or price, only with the best-suited contractor, including in FAR subpart 8.4 procurements.  See, e.g., A Square 
Grp., LLC , B-421792.5, Apr. 11, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶  95 at 7 (denying protest ground 
alleging that the agency conducted unequal discussions pursuant to a similar solicitation provision in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement); Sky Solutions, LLC , supra at 6-7 (same); 
see also VariQ -CV JV, LLC, B -418551, B -418551.3, June 15, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  196 
at 18-20 (denying a similar challenge in a FAR subpart 16.5 procurement).  In those 
decisions, which were protests challenging an agency’s conduct of exchanges, we denied protest grounds alleging the agency conducted unequal discussions primarily on 
the basis that the agency’s actions in holding exchanges were consistent with the terms of the solicitation, while also noting that the procurements at issue were conducted under FAR procedures other than those found at FA R part 15.  See Sky Solutions , LLC, 
supra at 7; VariQ -CV JV, LLC, supra at 20.   
 Mobomo’s protest presents a novel factual scenario.   That is, rather than a challenge to 
the propriety of exchanges with ResolveSoft following the agency’s initial evaluation, the protester contends the agency was required to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as 
part of its corrective action, so to place the two firms on an equal competitive footing for the reevaluation.   Here, on this record, we conclude that Mobomo cannot demonstrate it 
was competitively prejudiced by the agency’s conduct.   See, e.g., Interfor US, Inc., 
B-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD ¶ 19 at 7 (“Competitive prejudice is an essential 
element of every viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a protest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency’s actions arguably were improper.”).  
 Several facts in the record lead us to this conclusion.   First, we note that the parties are 
seemingly in agreement that the solicitation permitted the exchanges NOAA engaged in with ResolveSoft, as the apparent awardee, following the agency’s initial eval uation.   
See Supp. MOL at 2- 4; Supp. Comments at 6- 7.  Second,  the record demonstrates that 
ResolveSoft, as a result of those exchanges, made changes to its pricing volume, but did not make changes to its technical quotation.  See  AR, Tab  24, ADD at 10.  I ndeed, 
the agency’s technical reevaluation was unaffected as a result of those pricing changes.  Third, the record demonstrates that both after the agency’s initial evaluation of 
quotations, and after its reevaluation following its decision to take corrective action in response to Mobomo’s initial protest, ResolveSoft was determined to be the best -suited 
vendor .  Id.  That is, the status quo ante prior to the agency’s undertaking corrective 
action remained in effect; ResolveSoft endured as the best -suited v endor  even at a 
higher price.   Finally, and as discussed more fully above, we find no basis to object to  Page 15 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  the agency’s reevaluation conclusions, to include NOAA’s evaluation of vendors’ 
technical quotations, or  that ResolveSoft’s quotation was technically superior to 
Mobomo’s quotation.  
 Under these unique facts, Mobomo cannot reasonably demonstrate it was prejudiced by 
the agency’s conduct .  Mobomo was not the best -suited vendor  following the initial 
evaluation, nor was it the best -suited vendor  following the agency’s reevaluation.  Id.  
Thus, under the established terms of the solicitation, Mobomo was not eligible for exchanges with NOAA.   See Sky Solutions , supra at 7 (denying protest on basis that 
agency, having determined the awardee was the best -suited vendor, reasonably 
entered into exchanges with the firm).  Moreover, as the protester acknowledges, our 
Office’s decisions explain an agency may conduct exchanges solely with the best -suited 
vendor  so long as the agency “reasonably and fairly” evaluates vendors’ quotations.  
Comments at 6 (citing S2 Analytical Sols., LLC, B -422281.3, Dec. 20, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 312 at 3).    
 Again, as developed more fully, above, we find reasonable the agency’s underlying 
evaluation of quotations.   And finally, ResolveSoft, through exchanges, made no 
alterations to its technical quotation, and the firm’s pricing changes had no impact on the underlying merits of the agency’s reevaluation or tradeoff decision.  AR, Tab 24, 
ADD at 10.  In sum:  Resolv eSoft’s initial quotation was evaluated as technically 
superior; the exchanges had no bearing on ResolveSoft’s technical quotation and were limited t o a single issue, resulting in a net increase to the awardee’s proposed price; 
and ResolveSoft’s unchanged, initial non- price quotation was confirmed as technically 
superior following the agency’s reevaluation.  On this specific record, we find no basis to 
sustain the protest allegation.  
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 Open SAN Consulting LLC , doing business as OSC Edge  (OSC) , of Atlanta, Georgia, 
protests the issuance of a task order to Scientific Research Corporation (SRC) , also 
located in Atlanta, Georgia,  under task order request for proposals (TORFP) 
No. N66001- 24-R- 3522, issued by the Department of the Navy , Naval Information 
Warfare Center Pacific  for technical engineering and installation services .  OSC 
challenges the evaluation of the offerors’ organizational experience and key personnel .  
The protester also argues that the best -value trade- off determination was unreasonable.   
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On July 24, 2024 , the Navy issued the TORFP to holders of the Navy ’s SeaPort Next 
Generation multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) contract, 
pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16.  Agency DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423287; B -423287.2   Report (AR), Tab 5 , TORFP  at 1.1  The solicitation seeks  proposals to provide t echnical 
engineering and installation services to support a new c ommand and control facility at 
the U.S. Space C ommand in Colorado Springs, C olorado.  Id. at 73.   The TO RFP 
contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a 1- year base period 
and four 1- year option periods.  Id. at 13; AR, Tab 7 , Business Clearance Memorandum 
(BCM)  at 4; Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 2 . 
 
Award was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis considering three factors:  
organizational experience, key personnel,  and cost.2  TORFP at 68.   The organizational 
experience  factor  was of equal importance to the key personnel evaluation factor.   Id. 
The non- cost evaluation factors , when combined, were significantly more important than 
cost.  Id.  
 Under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate each offeror’s 
experience related to five key areas:  key area 1 (hiring and r etaining engineering 
professionals ), key  area 2 (enterprise server ), key area 3  (enterprise system 
management ), key area 4  (virtual desktop infrastructure ); and key area 5 (consolidated 
infrastructure administration) .  Id. at 62.   To demonstrate its experience, each offeror 
was to provide up to three references.   Id.  Under the key personnel factor, the agency 
was to evaluate the extent to which the offeror’s proposed key personnel met and exceeded desired qualifications  set forth in the TORFP.  Id. at 70.   
 The Navy  received timely submitted proposals from f ive offerors, including OSC and 
SRC.  AR, Tab 7 , BCM  at 8; COS/MOL at 4.  After evaluating the proposals, the agency 
assigned OSC’s and SRC’s  proposals the following ratings:

 OSC  SRC  
Acceptability  Acceptable  Acceptable  
Organizational Experience  Good  Outstanding  
Key Personnel  Good  Outstanding  
Total Evaluated Cost  $43,395,597  $44,338,534

1 Citations to the record are to the documents’ Adobe PDF pagination.  The agency 
amended the TORFP twice; all citations to the TORFP are to the consolidated amended version at t ab 5 of the agency report.   
2 Prior to the evaluation of technical capability and cost, the TORFP also provided for a 
determination of acceptability for each offer on a pass/fail basis.  TORFP at 69- 70. 
3 The agency evaluated proposals under the non- price factors as:  outstanding, good, 
acceptable, marginal or unacceptable.  AR, Tab  8, Source Selection Evaluation Board 
Report (SSEB Report)  at 3.  Page 3    B-423287; B -423287.2   In conducting the best -value tradeoff, the agency found that “SRC’s superior 
demonstrated organizational experience and [its] ability to provide higher qualified key 
personnel warrants paying an $868,457.74 or 2% evaluated cost premium over OSC ’s 
evaluated cost, across the span of 5- years to a more qualified contractor.”  Id. at 46.  
The agency concluded that SRC’s proposal represented the best value to the 
government.  Id.  
 On December 23, 2024, the agency notified OSC that its proposal had not been 
selected for award.  AR, Tab 1, Notice of Award.  After requesting and receiving a 
debriefing that concluded on January 13, 2025, OSC filed this protest with our Office.

 DISCUSSION  The protester raises numerous arguments challenging the agency ’s evaluation of the 
offerors ’ proposals under the organizational experience and key personnel  factors .  For 
example, the protester challenges a weakness assessed to its proposal under the organizational experience factor.  The protester also contends that the Navy unreasonably failed to assign a significant strength to its proposal under the key 
personnel factor.  With regard to the awardee, the protester asserts that the agency 
improperly allow ed SRC to provide more than the three references allowed by the 
solicitation in support of its organizational experience.  Finally, the protester maintains 
that the best -value tradeoff was unreasonable.   For the reasons discussed below, we 
find no basis to sustain the protest.

 The evaluation of an offeror’s proposal is a matter within the agency’s discretion.

5 Although we do not address all of the protester ’s arguments in this decision, we have 
considered all of them and any not directly addressed in this decision are without merit.   Page 4    B-423287; B -423287.2    
Organizational Experience  OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assessed its proposal with a significant weakness under key area 1 of the organizational experience factor --hiring and r etaining 
engineering professionals --for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain 
cybersecurity and infrastructure engineering professionals .  Specifically, OSC argues 
the agency ignored language in its proposal.  Protest at 11.  The protester also asserts 
that the agency improperly  determined that one of OSC’s  contract references was not 
relevant  to key area 1.   The protester further asserts that in conducting its evaluation, 
the agency improperly applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Id. at 13.  As discussed 
below, we find none of the protester’s arguments provides a basis to sustain the protest.  
 As noted above, under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate 
each offeror’s experience related to five key areas .  Of relevance here, key area 1 was 
experience “in hiring and r etaining engineering professionals , specifically Information 
Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineer ing, in the Colorado 
Springs, CO area.”
6  TORFP at 62.   The TORFP specified that offerors must cite at 
least one reference for work performed by the prime offeror, no more than one reference per subcontractor, and no more than three references total.  Id.   For each 
cited reference, the s olicitation required offerors to submit a r eference information sheet 
in which the offeror would provide a summary description of the contract work, including an explanation of the relevance of each cited reference with respect to one or more of the key areas.  Id.  The agency was to evaluate the breadth, depth and relevance of an 
offeror’s cited organizational experience in the key areas since July 1, 2019.  Id. at 69 . 
The solicitation made clear that the a gency was “not bound by an offeror’s opinion of 
the relevance of its organizational experience.”  Id. at 62. 
 In evaluating OSC’s proposal under the organizational experience factor, the agency assessed a significant strength for the enterprise server key area, a significant strength 
for the enterprise system management key area, a significant strength for the virtual desktop infrastructure key area, a  strength for the consolidated infrastructure 
administration key area, and a  significant weakness for  the hiring and retaining 
engineering professionals key area, resulting in an overall rating of good for the organiz ational experience factor.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41; AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report 
at 13. 
 The agency determined that OSC’s proposal provided one reference relevant to key 
area 1; the reference was for North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD)/United 
States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) information technology ( IT) Network 
Operations and Maintenance Support (N2NOMS) --a contract performed by  [DELETED] , 
a proposed subcontractor.  AR , Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  This relevant reference 
 
6 The other key areas of experience related to enterprise server support, enterprise 
system management support, virtual desktop infrastructure, and consolidated infrastructure administration.  TORFP at 62 .  Page 5    B-423287; B -423287.2   stated that in “support of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT 
professionals including systems engineers, systems administrators, network engineers, 
network administrators, systems architects, database administrators, data center technicians, change managers, and service desk managers. ”  Id. (citing AR, Tab 9 , 
OSC Proposal at  13-14).  The reference further stated that, “[i]n support of the long- term 
task and the project based additional work, [DELETED]  has averaged an 18- month 
tenure on all progr am hires, and our long- term hires have been in place for over three 
years. ”  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  14; Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  
 In evaluating OSC’s proposal, the agency assessed a significant weakness based on two identified flaws.  First, the agency found that although i nformation systems and 
network engineers we re explicitly identified in the  N2NOMS contract, infrastructure or 
cybersecurity engineers we re not , meaning that  OSC had only  partially show n 
experience hiring engineering professionals in Colorado Springs, C olorado, under the 
N2NOMS contract.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41.  Second, the agency found that “[i]n 
addition, [DELETED]  hired 32 contractors throughout this contract (11/26/2019 -
11/25/2024) in Colorado Springs but maintains an average of only 13- 15 full -time 
equivalents (p. 13) over the contract’s lifespan. ”  Id.  The agency concluded that “[t] his 
does not adequately demonstrate [ OSC’s ] ability to retain the needed engineering 
talent. ”  Id.  In making this determination, the agency noted that “[t] he ability to hire AND 
retain technical engineering talent in the Colorado Springs area is crucial for the successful performance of this [U.S. Space Command]  requirement. ”  Id. 
 The protester disagrees with the agency’s evaluation, arguing that the agency 
disregarded or misconstrued the proposal ’s description of [DELETED] ’s experience 
retaining professionals under the N2NOMS contract  when assigning the significant 
weakness .  Protest at 11 -13.  OSC maintains that because its proposal indicated the 
hiring of 32 IT professionals , but an average of only 13- 15 full time equivalents ( FTEs ) 
over the period of performance, the agency  incorrectly  assumed that a large number of 
the hires were not being retained.  Rather, per the protester, the clear language of 
OSC’s  proposal should have led the agency to determine that the disparity between the 
two numbers is attributable to the fact that a number of the 32 hires were short term employees hired to meet surge requirements.  
 In support of its argument, OSC points to the following description in its proposal of its 
subcontractor ’s recruitment and retention experience under the N2NOMS contract : 
 
[DELETED]  averages 13- 15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the life of the 
contract and has also provided additional head count and support for project -based surge and specialized resources for implementations and 
testing of new systems or technologies.  Over the life of the contract, we 
have hired 32 contractors to support this effort.  
Protest at 11 (citing AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 13 ). 
 
OSC asserts that this language in its proposal meant that “ the contract requires 
[DELETED]  to hire and retain a permanent staff the size of 13- 15 FTEs, which the  Page 6    B-423287; B -423287.2   subcontractor fulfilled.”  Protest at 11 -12.  The protester further asserts that “[i]n addition 
to this regular workforce, to support ‘project -based surge and specialized resources for 
implementation and testing of new systems or technologies, ’” its proposal explained that 
“[DELETED]  ‘also provided additional head count.’”  Protest at 12 (citing AR, Tab 9, 
OSC Proposal at 11).  From this, OSC argues that its proposal clearly demonstrated 
that [DELETED]  hired a total of 32 IT professionals that were a mix of  long- term and 
surge employees.  Id. at 12.  The agency responds that OSC’s proposal lacked clear 
and definitive retention information necessary to adequately demonstrate their ability to 
retain the needed engineering talent.  COS/MOL at 7.  
 Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  The record shows that OSC’s proposal stated that “in support of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT professionals[.]”  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  13.  It also 
stated that [DELETED]  maintains on average “ 13-15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the 
life of the contract .”  Id.  Contrary to OSC’s argument, the proposal does not provide a 
“clear representation about [DELETED] ’ staff retention experience under the N2NOMS 
contract.”  Protest at  11.  As the agency explains in response to the protest , OSC’s 
proposal did not connect the delta between overall number of staff hired for the contract and the average “ongoing” FTEs to surge requirements, as OSC argues in the protest.  Protest at 11; COS/ MOL at 6.  Specifically, although OSC’s proposal  also states that 
[DELETED]  “provided additional head count and support for project -based surge,” the 
proposal never states that any of the “hired 32 IT professionals,” of which [DELETED]  
retained only “13- 15 FTES on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract,” were surge 
employees.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Pro posal  at 13.  It is an offeror ’s responsibility to submit a 
well-written proposal, with adequately detailed information, which clearly demonstrates 
compliance with the solicitation requirements and allows for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Tribalco, LLC , B-421837.3, Feb. 5, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 49 at 6.  Here, 
to the extent OSC wanted the agency to know that the difference between the 32 hired 
employees and the 13-15 average FTEs  is due to roughly 17 of the hired employees 
being surge support , then it was incumbent upon OSC to adequately explain this in its 
proposal.  OSC’s proposal failed to do so.  As such, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.
7  The protest ground is denied.  
 
7 In a supplemental protest, OSC also claims the agency disparately evaluated the 
offerors’ stated retention rates.  Comments  & Supp. Protest  at 16- 19.  According to 
OSC, the agency’s comparison of OSC’s and SRC’s retention rates “cannot be fair” because the agency accepted SRC’s stated 82.1 percent  retention rate without 
questioning how it was calculated,  but arbitrarily calculated OSC’s retention rate based 
on the assumption that [DELETED]  hired 32 IT professional s but only retained 13- 15 of 
them on the N2NOMS contract.  Id. at 17.  While OSC contends that t his argument is 
based on the agency’s comparison of retention rates in the Business Clearance Memorandum, see id., the agency provided OSC with the exact same information in the 
debriefing.  Compare AR, Tab 7, BCM at 40- 42, with AR, Tab 3, OSC Debrief  at 49.  As 
such, OSC was required to raise this argument within ten days of the debriefing.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a); Supp. COS/ MOL  at 4-5.  Because OSC first presented this 
(continued...)   Page 7    B-423287; B -423287.2    Unstated Evaluation Criterion 
 
OSC also asserts  that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion under 
organizational experience key area 1 when highlighting that its proposal’s description of 
the N2NOMS contract does not reflect experience hiring infrastructure or cybersecurity engineers.  Protest at 13-16.  This argument stems from the agency’s answer to one of 
OSC’s debriefing questions regarding the key area 1 evaluation wherein the agency stated that there was insufficient detail in OSC’s proposal regarding the program hires or long- term hires, for example, identification of the “labor categories for these ‘hires.’”  
AR, Tab 4, Debriefing Answers  at 3.  OSC asserts there was no evaluation criteri on for 
this key area that required identification of labor categories with respect to hiring and retention, and therefore, to the extent that  OSC’s evaluation was based on the failure of 
OSC’s proposal to provide “labor categories” for the 32 hires , it reflects an unstated 
evaluation criteri on.  Protest at  13.   
 The agency responds that, in its answer to the debriefing question, the agency was “merely trying to explain to OSC what type of information may have assisted in making the information it did provide more meaningful for evaluation.”   COS/MOL at 7 -8.  In this 
regard, the agency explains that it did not assess the weakness based on the failure of 
OSC’s proposal  to include labor categories, but rather, that the identified flaw was 
based on the failure of OSC’s proposal to provide any information regarding the retention of infrastructure or cybersecurity engineering talent as required by the solicitation.  Id.  at 7. 
 Based on our review, we find that the agency’s evaluation was not based on an 
unstated evaluation criterion.  T he TORFP  expressly required offerors to demonstrate 
experience hiring and retaining specific engineering positions relevant to the work to be performed in the Colorado Springs area, specifically including infrastructure and 
cybersecurity engineering positions .  TORFP at 6 2.  As noted above, the agency 
identified a flaw because OSC’s proposal failed to demonstrate that [DELETED]  had 
experience hiring and retaining infrastructure engineers and cybersecurity engineers  
under the N2NOMS contract .  While the protester alleges that the agency improperly 
assessed a flaw to it s proposal for failing to identify labor categories for the 32 hires, the 
protester has failed to demonstrate, and there is no indication in the evaluation record,  
that the agency evaluated or expected offerors to provide information regarding labor categories.  The agency’s evaluation was consistent with the solicitation and reasonable.  Accordingly, t his protest ground is denied.  
 
 
argument as a supplemental protest on March 3, 2025, nearly two months after the debriefing, the argument is dismissed as untimely.    Page 8    B-423287; B -423287.2    Relevance of Reference 
 
As noted above, relevant to the hiring and r etaining engineering professionals  key area, 
the agency determined that OSC’s proposal provided one relevant reference for its 
subcontractor,  [DELETED] .  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  OSC argues the agency 
unreasonably found not relevant its second reference,  which was for Information 
Technology Infrastructure Support 3 (ITIS3) for the U.S. Army, Human Resources Command (HRC) at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Indianapolis, Indiana.  Protest at 16- 17. 
 The solicitation provided clear requirements regarding what experience the agency was 
to evaluate under the organizational experience factor in each key area and the relevant timeframe for such experience.  TORFP at 62 .  The solicitation required offerors to 
“indicate the breadth, depth and relevance of your organizational experience since 01 July 2019” and,  for key area 1,  to demonstrate “[e]xperience in hiring and retaining 
engineering professionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.”  Id.   Accordingly, the 
solicitation expressly identified the type of engineering positions and performance location that would be considered relevant to key area 1.  
 When evaluating OSC’s proposal against these criteria, the agency determined that OSC’s HRC contract was not relevant to key area 1 because the place of performance 
was Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Indianapolis, Indiana, whereas the contract awarded under the solicitation here will be performed in the Colorado Springs area.  AR, Tab 8, 
SSEB Report at 11.  
 
OSC argues that this finding reflects an unstated evaluation criterion because “[t]here is no mention in the [ s]olicitation that the recruitment and retention experience has to be 
explicitly for in -person staff in the Colorado Springs area.”
8  Protest at 18.  OSC further 
maintains that the HRC contract was relevant because even though the contract was not performed in Colorado Springs, “some” staff for unidentified positions were recruited 
 
8 In its supplemental protest, OSC also contends that the agency’s evaluation “gives 
rise to a latent ambiguity” because the solicitation did not specifically require experience hiring in -person IT professionals, and it was reasonable for OSC to believe hiring 
remote workers would be relevant.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 16.  In response, the 
agency argues that OSC’s latent ambiguity argument relies “on the same facts that OSC was aware of when it made its initial unstated evaluation criteria argument in its protest.”  Supp. COS/MOL  at 2-3.  That is, both OSC’s unstated evaluation criteria 
argument and its latent ambiguity argument are based on the a gency finding the HRC 
contract not relevant because its place of performance was not the Colorado Springs area--a finding of which OSC was made aware in its debriefing.  AR, Tab 3, OSC 
Debrief at 3.  Accordingly, to be timely, OSC would have needed to raise its latent 
ambiguity argument in its initial protest.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).  Because OSC did not 
make this argument until it submitted its comments 49 days after the a gency responded 
to OSC’s debriefing questions, this argument is dismissed as untimely .  Page 9    B-423287; B -423287.2   from the area and work ed remotely from Colorado Springs .  See id.  at 17.   In support of 
its position, OSC quotes two lines from its proposal:  
 
OSC Edge staffs the HRC ITIS3 contract with engineering professionals.  
Our staff is a combination of onsite and remote and we do have staff in the Colorado Springs area to include key personnel.  
Id. (quoting AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal  at 7).  
 
The agency  maintains that “hiring and retention in Colorado Springs for a contract with a 
place of performance on- site logically encompasses looking at an offeror’s ability to hire 
and retain in that capacity.”  COS/ MOL at 9.  In this regard, the agency further explains 
in response to the protest that “[t]he capacity to hire and retain engineering 
professionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO  area for an onsite requirement 
is not an equivalent to the capacity to hire and retain for telework in Colorado Springs.”  Id.   
 Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  While the protester contends that the solicitation evaluation criteria for hiring and retaining engineering professionals did not require demonstration of recruitment and retention experience explicitly for in- person staff in the Colorado Springs area, we do 
not find that the agency’s determination that the HRC contract was not relevant on this basis was improper.  In evaluating a proposal, an agency properly may take into 
account specific, albeit not expressly identified, matters that are logically encompassed 
by or related to the stated evaluation criteria.  Preferred Sys. Sols. , B-291750, Feb. 24, 
2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 56 at 2.   
 The record shows that while OSC’s reference demonstrated the capacity to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs who were willing to telework, it failed to demonstrate the 
ability to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs for an onsite assignment.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 7.  Because an offeror’s ability to hire and retain staff to work on- site in 
Colorado Springs is logically encompassed within the evaluation criteria, which expressly identify the performance location that would be considered relev ant to key 
area 1, it was reasonable for the agency to find that OSC’s HRC reference was not relevant for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain staff on- site in Colorado 
Springs.   TORFP at 62.   As such, we find that the agency’s evaluation--including 
consideration of an offeror’s ability to demonstrate hiring and retention for on- site work 
in the Colorado Springs area in assessing relevance--is not based on an unstated 
evaluation criterion.  While the protester may disagree with  the agency’s  assessment of 
relevance for its HRC reference, such disagreement, without more, is insufficient to establish that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  FreeAlliance.com, LLC ,

  Page 10    B-423287; B -423287.2    Awardee’s Organizational Experience References  
 
The solicitation specified that offerors could provide “no more than three references 
total” in support of their organizational experience.  TORFP at 6 2.  One of the awardee’s 
references was for  its C2 Mission Services (C2 Cyber) t ask order No. N6600123F0062 
under SRC ’s Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific  IDIQ contract.  AR, Tab  11, SRC 
Proposal at 3.  OSC argues that the agency’s evaluation of SRC’s C2 Cyber  reference 
was unreasonable because the evaluation noted that SRC started hiring IT professionals for the task order  two years before the task order began in November 
2022.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 33.  OSC claims that the agency improperly 
credited SRC for hiring and retention experience that took place before the C2 Cyber  
task order began--essentially asserting that SRC attempted to bootstrap other efforts external to the C2 Cyber  task order to its C2 Cyber  reference, thereby allowing SRC to 
provide more than the three references allowed by the solicitation.  Id.  at 33- 36.   
 As noted previously, the TORFP defined  the hiring and r etaining engineering 
professionals  key area as recent (since July  1, 2019) “[e]xperience in hiring and 
retaining engineering professionals, specifically I nformation Systems, Network, 
Infrastructure, and C ybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.”  
TORFP at 62 .  In SRC’s reference for the C2 Cyber  task order, SRC cites its “support [ ] 
[for] the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNO RTHCOM) (N- NC) Cyberspace Operations 
Directorate (J6) Mission Systems Support Team since November 2020. ”  AR, Tab 11, 
SRC Proposal at 4.   
 
In addition, SRC’s proposal states that it has also “supported the United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) J6 Directorate’s Consolidated Space Operations Facility Team (J6X) and J6 Cyber (J6C) since February 2021, on [C2 Cyber] [t]ask [o]rder (TO) N6600123F0062.”  Id.   In this regard, SRC notes that “SRC has teamed with 
[DELETED]  and [DELETED]  to provide the Government with the ultimate combination of 
flexibility, technical expertise, and tailored staffing in Colorado Springs.”   Id.  
Specifically, SRC’s pr oposal states that, in order to “overcome the challenges of staffing 
in the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the Department of Defense [(DOD)],” it has, “[s]ince November 2020, [ ] hired 35 IT professionals in the 
Colorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering.”  Id.  SRC also states that, for 
this task order, it “successfully staffed six uniquely qualified Full -Time Equivalent (FTE) 
IS and Cybersecurity engineering positions --each with Top Secret (TS) security 
clearances and eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) read- in.”  Id.   
 In evaluating SRC’s C2 Cyber  reference, the agency found that “ SRC has demonstrated 
successful staffing and retention in the Colorado Springs area for the Department of Defense”, noting that “[s]ince November 2020, SRC has hired 35 IT professionals in the Colorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering. ”  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 7.  
  Page 11    B-423287; B -423287.2   OSC disagrees with the agency’s evaluation and asserts that SRC’s proposal included 
“an indeterminate number of experience references,” and that the agency unreasonably credited SRC for three years of performance by itself and other companies prior to the beginning of the C2 Cyber  task order.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35.   In response, 
the agency explains that SRC’s proposal simply demonstrated how SRC hired and retained personnel for the C2 Cyber  task order.  Supp. COS/ MOL at 7.  The agency 
maintains that “ [w]hether SRC hired these employees before or during the task order is 
immaterial” because “the fact [is] that [SRC was ] able to hire and retain for performance 
under” the C2 Cyber  task order.  Id.    
 Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  The record reflects  that SRC’s partnerships with the two [DELETED]  companies and the 
hiring discussed in SRC’s C2 Cyber reference was in support of the C2 Cyber  task 
order.  While OSC is correct that the task order in SRC’s C2 Cyber  reference did not 
begin until November 2022, this does not mean that hiring was not conducted in anticipation of the task order.  Although the relevant task order did not begin until 
November 2022, SRC ’s proposal explains that it  started recruiting in November 2020 in 
anticipation of the task order to “overcome the challenges of staffing in the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the [DOD].”  AR, Tab 11, SRC 
Proposal  at 4.  While OSC asserts that SRC should not have received credit for the 
hiring that occurred prior to the start of the task order because the hiring was not done under the task order, as previously noted, the solicitation required offerors to provide “organiz ational experience since 01 July 201 9,” and key area 1 required experience 
hiring and retaining certain engineering professional in the Colorado Springs area.  TORFP at 62 .  The protester neither asserts nor cites to any requirement in the 
solicitation that specified that this hiring and retaining experience had to be obtained 
exclusively during a reference’s period of performance to be relevant or a prohibition on hiring and retaining experience in anticipation of performing a reference contract.  Supp. Comments at 5-12; TORFP at 6 2.  To the extent OSC asserts that it was improper for 
the agency to have considered SRC’s experience in this regard as relevant to SRC’s C2 Cyber task order, the protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation, without 
more, is insufficient to render the agency’s evaluation unreasonable.  This protest ground is denied.   Key Personnel  
 OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposal under the key personnel factor for its proposed senior systems engineer.  OSC also challenges the agency’s evaluation of the qualifications of  its proposed program 
manager , asserting that  OSC’s proposal merited a significant strength, rather than just a 
strength.     Senior Systems Engineer  
 OSC argues that the a gency’s evaluation under the key personnel factor  was 
unreasonable based on the assignment of a weakness for OSC’s proposed senior  Page 12    B-423287; B -423287.2   systems engineer.  OSC alleges that the a gency unreasonably assigned it s proposal  a 
weakness because it concluded that its proposed senior systems engineer  did not meet 
two of the solicitation’s seven desired experience areas  for the position.  Protest 
at 18-26.  OSC contends that the agency’s evaluation was improper because, in its 
view, the resume of its proposed senior systems engineer  “readily meets or exceeds the 
[a]gency’s evaluation criteria” and the a gency either misread or rigidly read OSC’s 
propos al.  Id. at 18. 
 
Under the key personnel factor, the TORFP  identified eight categories of key personnel 
to be evaluated, including as pertinent here a senior systems engineer.9  TORFP  
at 63-66.  The solicitation provided qualifications for each key personnel category.  Id. 
at 63, 65.  For the s enior systems engineer, the solicitation listed seven  desired 
qualifications.  Id.   Relevant here, these desired qualifications  included “[a]t least 5 
years of hands -on professional experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer for 
program/project of similar size and scope,” and “3 years of experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer supporting a DOD program of similar size and scope.”
10  Id. at 65.  
The TORFP required offerors to provide a resume for each identified key person and 
the agency was to evaluate “the extent to which the offeror’s proposed key personnel 
meet and exceed the desired qualifications.”  Id. at 70.   
 The resume included in OSC’s proposal for its proposed senior systems engineer  
provided that the individual had “5+” years of professional experience:  as a “Systems 
Engineer” for [DELETED]  from January 2021 to Present (September 4, 2024); as a 
“Windows System Administrator/Engineer” for [DELETED]  from August 2020 to January 
2021; and as an “Information Security Engineer” for [DELETED]  from October 2019 to 
October 2020.  AR, Tab 9,  OSC Proposal  at 27 -28. 
 
In assigning OSC ’s proposal  a weakness, the a gency found that the proposed 
candidate did not meet the qualifications  identified above for DOD experience and 
collective experience as a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at  46-47.  
In this regard, the agency noted that “[t]he desired collective ( [DOD] or otherwise) 
experience requirement for the position is a least five (5) years of hands -on professional 
 
9 Specifically, the TORFP identified the following key personnel categories:  systems 
architect and information systems lead (KP 1), network architect and network lead 
(KP2), onsite program manager (KP3), senior infrastructure engineer and infrastructure 
lead (KP4), senior cyber engineer and cyber lead (KP5), senior systems engineer 
(KP6), senior network engineer (KP7), and p roject manager (KP8).  TORFP at 61 -64. 
10 The TORFP also identified the following four additional qualifications/experience for 
the senior systems engineer:  a bachelor ’s degree in e ngineering, computer science, or 
an IT related field;  a TS level security clearance with the ability to obtain access to SCI ; 
three years of hands -on professional experience with virtual desktop infrastructure 
(VDI) ; a certified professional (NCP) certification ; and an information assurance 
technical/information assurance manager  (IAT/IAM ) certification, level II or greater.  Id. 
at 61, 63.  Page 13    B-423287; B -423287.2   experience as a Senior Systems Engineer for a program/project of similar size and 
scope.”  Id.  at 46.  The agency explained that the “candidate’s Systems Engineer 
experience was with [DELETED]  as a Windows System Administrator/Engineer from 
08/2020- 01/2021 and with [DELETED] as a Systems Engineer from 01/2021- Present. ”  
Id.  The agency found that the “number of years as a ‘ Senior Systems Engineer ’ cannot 
be adequately determined from the resume as no Senior -level positions were identified” 
and that “[t]his inexperience as a Senior Systems Engineer does not meet the desired [DOD] experience for the position. ”  Id.  The agency also noted that if OSC’s proposed 
candidate “had Senior Systems Engineering experience and did not necessarily meet the desired timeframe, it would be viewed differently;” “[h]owever, not having the necessary experience as a Senior Systems Engineer AND with only four years as a Systems Engineer does not adequately meet the critical desired experience elements for this position. ”  Id. at 46-47.   
 The agency thus concluded that the failure to meet  two of the seven desired 
qualifications increased the risk of unsuccessful performance and warranted a weakness.  Id.  The agency explained that the lack of required experience increased 
risk because “having a Systems Engineer filling a Senior Systems Engineer position . . . will likely require more government oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision 
making and tasks” and “impact OSC Edge’s ability to meet project deadlines” in that the 
individuals filling these senior level positions “are expected to lead and manage their own teams within their functional area.”  Id. at 49.    
 In addition, in response to the protest, the agency explains that  it “does not dispute that 
the proposed engineer did the work as described in the proposal,” but rather that  “the 
nature or type of work performed”  by OSC’s proposed senior systems engineer  as 
described in the resume says nothing about whether the work was done at a senior 
level.  COS/ MOL at 10.  In this regard, the agency notes that a “senior engineer is a 
more experienced engineer with significantly more responsibility often leading projects , 
handling complex problems independently, and mentoring junior engineers.”  Id.  The 
agency explains that OSC’s proposed candidate’s resume “did not call out any higher level technical expertise or leadership experience.”  Id.   The agency states that “OSC's 
proposal identifies his current position as a System Engineer only” and that “the prior work experiences also identify him as a Systems Engineer vice a Senior Systems Engineer.”  Id.  The agency explains that “[h]aving done the work under the guidance of 
a Senior Systems Engineer is not the same as performing and leading as a Senior System Engineer” and that the “work as described years of experience does not de facto lend itself to a conclusion [that the candidate’s] engineering experience was at the 
‘Senior ’ level. ”  Id.  In this regard, the agency explained in response to the protester’s 
debriefing questions that  “the Government was unable to decipher if the proposed 
candidate was performing [the functions identified in the resume] as a [s]enior [s]yst ems 
[e]ngineer, a [s]ystems [e]ngineer, or under the direction of a [s]enior [s]ystems [e]ngineer.”  AR, Tab 4 , Debriefing Response at 5.  
 The protester disagrees with the agency’s evaluation and maintains that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because  Page 14    B-423287; B -423287.2   its evaluation improperly “focus[ed] on job titles alone” and “ ignore[ ed] [the candidate’s] 
qualifications and experiences on the senior level that was detailed in his resume.”  
Supp. Comments  at 4, 26.   
 Based on our review we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  The record reflects that this key person’s resume described the candidate as a systems engineer rather than a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 27 -28.  
The agency concluded, based on the language in the resume, that it could not determine the number of years of the individual’s experience as a senior systems engineer.   AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 46.   Offerors are  responsible for drafting a well -
written proposal that allow s for meaningful review by the a gency .  Abacus Tech. Corp. ; 
SMS Data Products Grp., Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 201 6, 2016 CPD ¶ 317 at 17.   
Here, OSC’s  proposal did not reflect the information that OSC apparently intended to 
convey .  In assigning OSC a weakness for this aspect of its proposal, the a gency 
considered all of th e proposed key individual’s  experience and reasonably concluded 
that experience increased the risk of unsuccessful performance because his resume did not clearly indicate three years of experience as a senior systems engineer supporting 
DOD and five years of overall experience as a senior systems engineer.  Although OSC 
may disagree with the a gency’s substantive assessment that OSC did not clearly 
demonstrate the required years of senior level experience, its disagreement with the agency’s judgment, without  more, is insufficient to establish that the a gency acted 
unreasonably.   
 OSC also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because the TORFP referred to the qualifications as 
desired, rather than required.  Protest at 26.  We note, however , that the TORFP 
provided that the agency ’s evaluation of proposed key personnel would “consider the 
extent to which the offeror’s proposed key personnel meet and exceed the desired qualifications ,” TORFP  at 70, and as discussed above, we find reasonable the agency’s 
evaluation that the failure of OSC’s proposal to demonstrate that its proposed senior 
systems engineer had the desired years of experience as a senior systems engineer increases the risk of unsuccessful performance because  it will likely require more 
government oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision making and tasks and 
may impact OSC’s ability to meet project deadlines .  Accordingly, it was reasonable for 
the agency to label its concern regarding OSC’s ability to meet the desired qualifications as a weakness.   This protest ground is denied.  
  Project Manager  
 OSC also argues that the agency acted unreasonably when it assigned a strength versus a significant strength to its proposed project manager.  Protest at 27.  
Specifically, OSC asserts that rather than assess ing an overall strength for  its proposed 
project manager based on the finding that the project manager exceeded two of the desired qualifications, the agency should have found that  the project manager exceeded 
at least five of the six desired qualifications for that key personnel category and assigned  a significant strength.  Based on our review of the record, we find nothing  Page 15    B-423287; B -423287.2   unreasonable regarding the agency’s assessment of a strength, rather than a significant 
strength, for OSC’s proposed project manager.  However, even if the agency erred in this regard, the protester has failed to show that it was competitively prejudiced by any such error.   
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency ’s improper 
actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  CACI, Inc. -
Federal; General Dynamics One Source, LLC , B-413860.4 et al. , Jan. 5, 2018, 2018 
CPD ¶ 17 at 26- 27.   
 Here, even if the agency erred its evaluation and should have found OSC’s proposed project manager  to exceed five of the six desired requirements for the position, leading 
to a significant strength, rather than a strength,  OSC has not demonstrated  that, but for 
this error, it s proposal, which was lower rated than SRC’s under both the organizational 
experience and key personnel factors and which had only a slightly lower evaluated cost,  would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.   Accordingly , we 
conclude that the protester has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency’s assignment of a strength instead of a significant strength and find no basis to 
sustain the protest.  
 Best-Value Determination 
 Finally, OSC argues that because the underlying evaluation was flawed, the agency ’s 
best-value determination was unreasonable.  This allegation is based on the protester ’s 
challenges to the agency ’s evaluation, all of which we have denied as set forth above.  
Thus, we dismiss this allegation because the allegations do not establish an 
independent basis of protest.  Advanced Alliant Solutions Team, LLC , B-417334,

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging agency evaluation of proposals and tradeoff decision is denied where the evaluation and tradeoff decision were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation. 
DECISION  
 Open SAN Consulting LLC , doing business as OSC Edge  (OSC) , of Atlanta, Georgia, 
protests the issuance of a task order to Scientific Research Corporation (SRC) , also 
located in Atlanta, Georgia,  under task order request for proposals (TORFP) 
No. N66001- 24-R- 3522, issued by the Department of the Navy , Naval Information 
Warfare Center Pacific  for technical engineering and installation services .  OSC 
challenges the evaluation of the offerors’ organizational experience and key personnel .  
The protester also argues that the best -value trade- off determination was unreasonable.   
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On July 24, 2024 , the Navy issued the TORFP to holders of the Navy ’s SeaPort Next 
Generation multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) contract, 
pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16.  Agency DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423287; B -423287.2   Report (AR), Tab 5 , TORFP  at 1.1  The solicitation seeks  proposals to provide t echnical 
engineering and installation services to support a new c ommand and control facility at 
the U.S. Space C ommand in Colorado Springs, C olorado.  Id. at 73.   The TO RFP 
contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a 1- year base period 
and four 1- year option periods.  Id. at 13; AR, Tab 7 , Business Clearance Memorandum 
(BCM)  at 4; Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 2 . 
 
Award was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis considering three factors:  
organizational experience, key personnel,  and cost.2  TORFP at 68.   The organizational 
experience  factor  was of equal importance to the key personnel evaluation factor.   Id. 
The non- cost evaluation factors , when combined, were significantly more important than 
cost.  Id.  
 Under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate each offeror’s 
experience related to five key areas:  key area 1 (hiring and r etaining engineering 
professionals ), key  area 2 (enterprise server ), key area 3  (enterprise system 
management ), key area 4  (virtual desktop infrastructure ); and key area 5 (consolidated 
infrastructure administration) .  Id. at 62.   To demonstrate its experience, each offeror 
was to provide up to three references.   Id.  Under the key personnel factor, the agency 
was to evaluate the extent to which the offeror’s proposed key personnel met and exceeded desired qualifications  set forth in the TORFP.  Id. at 70.   
 The Navy  received timely submitted proposals from f ive offerors, including OSC and 
SRC.  AR, Tab 7 , BCM  at 8; COS/MOL at 4.  After evaluating the proposals, the agency 
assigned OSC’s and SRC’s  proposals the following ratings:
3 
 
 OSC  SRC  
Acceptability  Acceptable  Acceptable  
Organizational Experience  Good  Outstanding  
Key Personnel  Good  Outstanding  
Total Evaluated Cost  $43,395,597  $44,338,534

1 Citations to the record are to the documents’ Adobe PDF pagination.  The agency 
amended the TORFP twice; all citations to the TORFP are to the consolidated amended version at t ab 5 of the agency report.   
2 Prior to the evaluation of technical capability and cost, the TORFP also provided for a 
determination of acceptability for each offer on a pass/fail basis.  TORFP at 69- 70. 
3 The agency evaluated proposals under the non- price factors as:  outstanding, good, 
acceptable, marginal or unacceptable.  AR, Tab  8, Source Selection Evaluation Board 
Report (SSEB Report)  at 3.  Page 3    B-423287; B -423287.2   In conducting the best -value tradeoff, the agency found that “SRC’s superior 
demonstrated organizational experience and [its] ability to provide higher qualified key 
personnel warrants paying an $868,457.74 or 2% evaluated cost premium over OSC ’s 
evaluated cost, across the span of 5- years to a more qualified contractor.”  Id. at 46.  
The agency concluded that SRC’s proposal represented the best value to the 
government.  Id.  
 On December 23, 2024, the agency notified OSC that its proposal had not been 
selected for award.  AR, Tab 1, Notice of Award.  After requesting and receiving a 
debriefing that concluded on January 13, 2025, OSC filed this protest with our Office.

 DISCUSSION  The protester raises numerous arguments challenging the agency ’s evaluation of the 
offerors ’ proposals under the organizational experience and key personnel  factors .  For 
example, the protester challenges a weakness assessed to its proposal under the organizational experience factor.  The protester also contends that the Navy unreasonably failed to assign a significant strength to its proposal under the key 
personnel factor.  With regard to the awardee, the protester asserts that the agency 
improperly allow ed SRC to provide more than the three references allowed by the 
solicitation in support of its organizational experience.  Finally, the protester maintains 
that the best -value tradeoff was unreasonable.   For the reasons discussed below, we 
find no basis to sustain the protest.

4 The value of the task order is $44 million and is therefore within our jurisdiction to 
review protests related to the issuance of orders exceeding $3 5 million under multiple-
award IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).  
5 Although we do not address all of the protester ’s arguments in this decision, we have 
considered all of them and any not directly addressed in this decision are without merit.   Page 4    B-423287; B -423287.2    
Organizational Experience  OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assessed its proposal with a significant weakness under key area 1 of the organizational experience factor --hiring and r etaining 
engineering professionals --for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain 
cybersecurity and infrastructure engineering professionals .  Specifically, OSC argues 
the agency ignored language in its proposal.  Protest at 11.  The protester also asserts 
that the agency improperly  determined that one of OSC’s  contract references was not 
relevant  to key area 1.   The protester further asserts that in conducting its evaluation, 
the agency improperly applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Id. at 13.  As discussed 
below, we find none of the protester’s arguments provides a basis to sustain the protest.  
 As noted above, under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate 
each offeror’s experience related to five key areas .  Of relevance here, key area 1 was 
experience “in hiring and r etaining engineering professionals , specifically Information 
Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineer ing, in the Colorado 
Springs, CO area.”
6  TORFP at 62.   The TORFP specified that offerors must cite at 
least one reference for work performed by the prime offeror, no more than one reference per subcontractor, and no more than three references total.  Id.   For each 
cited reference, the s olicitation required offerors to submit a r eference information sheet 
in which the offeror would provide a summary description of the contract work, including an explanation of the relevance of each cited reference with respect to one or more of the key areas.  Id.  The agency was to evaluate the breadth, depth and relevance of an 
offeror’s cited organizational experience in the key areas since July 1, 2019.  Id. at 69 . 
The solicitation made clear that the a gency was “not bound by an offeror’s opinion of 
the relevance of its organizational experience.”  Id. at 62. 
 In evaluating OSC’s proposal under the organizational experience factor, the agency assessed a significant strength for the enterprise server key area, a significant strength 
for the enterprise system management key area, a significant strength for the virtual desktop infrastructure key area, a  strength for the consolidated infrastructure 
administration key area, and a  significant weakness for  the hiring and retaining 
engineering professionals key area, resulting in an overall rating of good for the organiz ational experience factor.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41; AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report 
at 13. 
 The agency determined that OSC’s proposal provided one reference relevant to key 
area 1; the reference was for North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD)/United 
States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) information technology ( IT) Network 
Operations and Maintenance Support (N2NOMS) --a contract performed by  [DELETED] , 
a proposed subcontractor.  AR , Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  This relevant reference 
 
6 The other key areas of experience related to enterprise server support, enterprise 
system management support, virtual desktop infrastructure, and consolidated infrastructure administration.  TORFP at 62 .  Page 5    B-423287; B -423287.2   stated that in “support of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT 
professionals including systems engineers, systems administrators, network engineers, 
network administrators, systems architects, database administrators, data center technicians, change managers, and service desk managers. ”  Id. (citing AR, Tab 9 , 
OSC Proposal at  13-14).  The reference further stated that, “[i]n support of the long- term 
task and the project based additional work, [DELETED]  has averaged an 18- month 
tenure on all progr am hires, and our long- term hires have been in place for over three 
years. ”  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  14; Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  
 In evaluating OSC’s proposal, the agency assessed a significant weakness based on two identified flaws.  First, the agency found that although i nformation systems and 
network engineers we re explicitly identified in the  N2NOMS contract, infrastructure or 
cybersecurity engineers we re not , meaning that  OSC had only  partially show n 
experience hiring engineering professionals in Colorado Springs, C olorado, under the 
N2NOMS contract.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41.  Second, the agency found that “[i]n 
addition, [DELETED]  hired 32 contractors throughout this contract (11/26/2019 -
11/25/2024) in Colorado Springs but maintains an average of only 13- 15 full -time 
equivalents (p. 13) over the contract’s lifespan. ”  Id.  The agency concluded that “[t] his 
does not adequately demonstrate [ OSC’s ] ability to retain the needed engineering 
talent. ”  Id.  In making this determination, the agency noted that “[t] he ability to hire AND 
retain technical engineering talent in the Colorado Springs area is crucial for the successful performance of this [U.S. Space Command]  requirement. ”  Id. 
 The protester disagrees with the agency’s evaluation, arguing that the agency 
disregarded or misconstrued the proposal ’s description of [DELETED] ’s experience 
retaining professionals under the N2NOMS contract  when assigning the significant 
weakness .  Protest at 11 -13.  OSC maintains that because its proposal indicated the 
hiring of 32 IT professionals , but an average of only 13- 15 full time equivalents ( FTEs ) 
over the period of performance, the agency  incorrectly  assumed that a large number of 
the hires were not being retained.  Rather, per the protester, the clear language of 
OSC’s  proposal should have led the agency to determine that the disparity between the 
two numbers is attributable to the fact that a number of the 32 hires were short term employees hired to meet surge requirements.  
 In support of its argument, OSC points to the following description in its proposal of its 
subcontractor ’s recruitment and retention experience under the N2NOMS contract : 
 
[DELETED]  averages 13- 15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the life of the 
contract and has also provided additional head count and support for project -based surge and specialized resources for implementations and 
testing of new systems or technologies.  Over the life of the contract, we 
have hired 32 contractors to support this effort.  
Protest at 11 (citing AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 13 ). 
 
OSC asserts that this language in its proposal meant that “ the contract requires 
[DELETED]  to hire and retain a permanent staff the size of 13- 15 FTEs, which the  Page 6    B-423287; B -423287.2   subcontractor fulfilled.”  Protest at 11 -12.  The protester further asserts that “[i]n addition 
to this regular workforce, to support ‘project -based surge and specialized resources for 
implementation and testing of new systems or technologies, ’” its proposal explained that 
“[DELETED]  ‘also provided additional head count.’”  Protest at 12 (citing AR, Tab 9, 
OSC Proposal at 11).  From this, OSC argues that its proposal clearly demonstrated 
that [DELETED]  hired a total of 32 IT professionals that were a mix of  long- term and 
surge employees.  Id. at 12.  The agency responds that OSC’s proposal lacked clear 
and definitive retention information necessary to adequately demonstrate their ability to 
retain the needed engineering talent.  COS/MOL at 7.  
 Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  The record shows that OSC’s proposal stated that “in support of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT professionals[.]”  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  13.  It also 
stated that [DELETED]  maintains on average “ 13-15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the 
life of the contract .”  Id.  Contrary to OSC’s argument, the proposal does not provide a 
“clear representation about [DELETED] ’ staff retention experience under the N2NOMS 
contract.”  Protest at  11.  As the agency explains in response to the protest , OSC’s 
proposal did not connect the delta between overall number of staff hired for the contract and the average “ongoing” FTEs to surge requirements, as OSC argues in the protest.  Protest at 11; COS/ MOL at 6.  Specifically, although OSC’s proposal  also states that 
[DELETED]  “provided additional head count and support for project -based surge,” the 
proposal never states that any of the “hired 32 IT professionals,” of which [DELETED]  
retained only “13- 15 FTES on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract,” were surge 
employees.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Pro posal  at 13.  It is an offeror ’s responsibility to submit a 
well-written proposal, with adequately detailed information, which clearly demonstrates 
compliance with the solicitation requirements and allows for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Tribalco, LLC , B-421837.3, Feb. 5, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 49 at 6.  Here, 
to the extent OSC wanted the agency to know that the difference between the 32 hired 
employees and the 13-15 average FTEs  is due to roughly 17 of the hired employees 
being surge support , then it was incumbent upon OSC to adequately explain this in its 
proposal.  OSC’s proposal failed to do so.  As such, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.
7  The protest ground is denied.  
 
7 In a supplemental protest, OSC also claims the agency disparately evaluated the 
offerors’ stated retention rates.  Comments  & Supp. Protest  at 16- 19.  According to 
OSC, the agency’s comparison of OSC’s and SRC’s retention rates “cannot be fair” because the agency accepted SRC’s stated 82.1 percent  retention rate without 
questioning how it was calculated,  but arbitrarily calculated OSC’s retention rate based 
on the assumption that [DELETED]  hired 32 IT professional s but only retained 13- 15 of 
them on the N2NOMS contract.  Id. at 17.  While OSC contends that t his argument is 
based on the agency’s comparison of retention rates in the Business Clearance Memorandum, see id., the agency provided OSC with the exact same information in the 
debriefing.  Compare AR, Tab 7, BCM at 40- 42, with AR, Tab 3, OSC Debrief  at 49.  As 
such, OSC was required to raise this argument within ten days of the debriefing.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a); Supp. COS/ MOL  at 4-5.  Because OSC first presented this 
(continued...)   Page 7    B-423287; B -423287.2    Unstated Evaluation Criterion 
 
OSC also asserts  that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion under 
organizational experience key area 1 when highlighting that its proposal’s description of 
the N2NOMS contract does not reflect experience hiring infrastructure or cybersecurity engineers.  Protest at 13-16.  This argument stems from the agency’s answer to one of 
OSC’s debriefing questions regarding the key area 1 evaluation wherein the agency stated that there was insufficient detail in OSC’s proposal regarding the program hires or long- term hires, for example, identification of the “labor categories for these ‘hires.’”  
AR, Tab 4, Debriefing Answers  at 3.  OSC asserts there was no evaluation criteri on for 
this key area that required identification of labor categories with respect to hiring and retention, and therefore, to the extent that  OSC’s evaluation was based on the failure of 
OSC’s proposal to provide “labor categories” for the 32 hires , it reflects an unstated 
evaluation criteri on.  Protest at  13.   
 The agency responds that, in its answer to the debriefing question, the agency was “merely trying to explain to OSC what type of information may have assisted in making the information it did provide more meaningful for evaluation.”   COS/MOL at 7 -8.  In this 
regard, the agency explains that it did not assess the weakness based on the failure of 
OSC’s proposal  to include labor categories, but rather, that the identified flaw was 
based on the failure of OSC’s proposal to provide any information regarding the retention of infrastructure or cybersecurity engineering talent as required by the solicitation.  Id.  at 7. 
 Based on our review, we find that the agency’s evaluation was not based on an 
unstated evaluation criterion.  T he TORFP  expressly required offerors to demonstrate 
experience hiring and retaining specific engineering positions relevant to the work to be performed in the Colorado Springs area, specifically including infrastructure and 
cybersecurity engineering positions .  TORFP at 6 2.  As noted above, the agency 
identified a flaw because OSC’s proposal failed to demonstrate that [DELETED]  had 
experience hiring and retaining infrastructure engineers and cybersecurity engineers  
under the N2NOMS contract .  While the protester alleges that the agency improperly 
assessed a flaw to it s proposal for failing to identify labor categories for the 32 hires, the 
protester has failed to demonstrate, and there is no indication in the evaluation record,  
that the agency evaluated or expected offerors to provide information regarding labor categories.  The agency’s evaluation was consistent with the solicitation and reasonable.  Accordingly, t his protest ground is denied.  
 
 
argument as a supplemental protest on March 3, 2025, nearly two months after the debriefing, the argument is dismissed as untimely.    Page 8    B-423287; B -423287.2    Relevance of Reference 
 
As noted above, relevant to the hiring and r etaining engineering professionals  key area, 
the agency determined that OSC’s proposal provided one relevant reference for its 
subcontractor,  [DELETED] .  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  OSC argues the agency 
unreasonably found not relevant its second reference,  which was for Information 
Technology Infrastructure Support 3 (ITIS3) for the U.S. Army, Human Resources Command (HRC) at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Indianapolis, Indiana.  Protest at 16- 17. 
 The solicitation provided clear requirements regarding what experience the agency was 
to evaluate under the organizational experience factor in each key area and the relevant timeframe for such experience.  TORFP at 62 .  The solicitation required offerors to 
“indicate the breadth, depth and relevance of your organizational experience since 01 July 2019” and,  for key area 1,  to demonstrate “[e]xperience in hiring and retaining 
engineering professionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.”  Id.   Accordingly, the 
solicitation expressly identified the type of engineering positions and performance location that would be considered relevant to key area 1.  
 When evaluating OSC’s proposal against these criteria, the agency determined that OSC’s HRC contract was not relevant to key area 1 because the place of performance 
was Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Indianapolis, Indiana, whereas the contract awarded under the solicitation here will be performed in the Colorado Springs area.  AR, Tab 8, 
SSEB Report at 11.  
 
OSC argues that this finding reflects an unstated evaluation criterion because “[t]here is no mention in the [ s]olicitation that the recruitment and retention experience has to be 
explicitly for in -person staff in the Colorado Springs area.”
8  Protest at 18.  OSC further 
maintains that the HRC contract was relevant because even though the contract was not performed in Colorado Springs, “some” staff for unidentified positions were recruited 
 
8 In its supplemental protest, OSC also contends that the agency’s evaluation “gives 
rise to a latent ambiguity” because the solicitation did not specifically require experience hiring in -person IT professionals, and it was reasonable for OSC to believe hiring 
remote workers would be relevant.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 16.  In response, the 
agency argues that OSC’s latent ambiguity argument relies “on the same facts that OSC was aware of when it made its initial unstated evaluation criteria argument in its protest.”  Supp. COS/MOL  at 2-3.  That is, both OSC’s unstated evaluation criteria 
argument and its latent ambiguity argument are based on the a gency finding the HRC 
contract not relevant because its place of performance was not the Colorado Springs area--a finding of which OSC was made aware in its debriefing.  AR, Tab 3, OSC 
Debrief at 3.  Accordingly, to be timely, OSC would have needed to raise its latent 
ambiguity argument in its initial protest.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).  Because OSC did not 
make this argument until it submitted its comments 49 days after the a gency responded 
to OSC’s debriefing questions, this argument is dismissed as untimely .  Page 9    B-423287; B -423287.2   from the area and work ed remotely from Colorado Springs .  See id.  at 17.   In support of 
its position, OSC quotes two lines from its proposal:  
 
OSC Edge staffs the HRC ITIS3 contract with engineering professionals.  
Our staff is a combination of onsite and remote and we do have staff in the Colorado Springs area to include key personnel.  
Id. (quoting AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal  at 7).  
 
The agency  maintains that “hiring and retention in Colorado Springs for a contract with a 
place of performance on- site logically encompasses looking at an offeror’s ability to hire 
and retain in that capacity.”  COS/ MOL at 9.  In this regard, the agency further explains 
in response to the protest that “[t]he capacity to hire and retain engineering 
professionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO  area for an onsite requirement 
is not an equivalent to the capacity to hire and retain for telework in Colorado Springs.”  Id.   
 Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  While the protester contends that the solicitation evaluation criteria for hiring and retaining engineering professionals did not require demonstration of recruitment and retention experience explicitly for in- person staff in the Colorado Springs area, we do 
not find that the agency’s determination that the HRC contract was not relevant on this basis was improper.  In evaluating a proposal, an agency properly may take into 
account specific, albeit not expressly identified, matters that are logically encompassed 
by or related to the stated evaluation criteria.  Preferred Sys. Sols. , B-291750, Feb. 24, 
2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 56 at 2.   
 The record shows that while OSC’s reference demonstrated the capacity to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs who were willing to telework, it failed to demonstrate the 
ability to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs for an onsite assignment.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 7.  Because an offeror’s ability to hire and retain staff to work on- site in 
Colorado Springs is logically encompassed within the evaluation criteria, which expressly identify the performance location that would be considered relev ant to key 
area 1, it was reasonable for the agency to find that OSC’s HRC reference was not relevant for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain staff on- site in Colorado 
Springs.   TORFP at 62.   As such, we find that the agency’s evaluation--including 
consideration of an offeror’s ability to demonstrate hiring and retention for on- site work 
in the Colorado Springs area in assessing relevance--is not based on an unstated 
evaluation criterion.  While the protester may disagree with  the agency’s  assessment of 
relevance for its HRC reference, such disagreement, without more, is insufficient to establish that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.  FreeAlliance.com, LLC , 
B-414531, June 19, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 191  at 5.  As such, t his protest ground is denied.  
  Page 10    B-423287; B -423287.2    Awardee’s Organizational Experience References  
 
The solicitation specified that offerors could provide “no more than three references 
total” in support of their organizational experience.  TORFP at 6 2.  One of the awardee’s 
references was for  its C2 Mission Services (C2 Cyber) t ask order No. N6600123F0062 
under SRC ’s Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific  IDIQ contract.  AR, Tab  11, SRC 
Proposal at 3.  OSC argues that the agency’s evaluation of SRC’s C2 Cyber  reference 
was unreasonable because the evaluation noted that SRC started hiring IT professionals for the task order  two years before the task order began in November 
2022.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 33.  OSC claims that the agency improperly 
credited SRC for hiring and retention experience that took place before the C2 Cyber  
task order began--essentially asserting that SRC attempted to bootstrap other efforts external to the C2 Cyber  task order to its C2 Cyber  reference, thereby allowing SRC to 
provide more than the three references allowed by the solicitation.  Id.  at 33- 36.   
 As noted previously, the TORFP defined  the hiring and r etaining engineering 
professionals  key area as recent (since July  1, 2019) “[e]xperience in hiring and 
retaining engineering professionals, specifically I nformation Systems, Network, 
Infrastructure, and C ybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.”  
TORFP at 62 .  In SRC’s reference for the C2 Cyber  task order, SRC cites its “support [ ] 
[for] the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNO RTHCOM) (N- NC) Cyberspace Operations 
Directorate (J6) Mission Systems Support Team since November 2020. ”  AR, Tab 11, 
SRC Proposal at 4.   
 
In addition, SRC’s proposal states that it has also “supported the United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) J6 Directorate’s Consolidated Space Operations Facility Team (J6X) and J6 Cyber (J6C) since February 2021, on [C2 Cyber] [t]ask [o]rder (TO) N6600123F0062.”  Id.   In this regard, SRC notes that “SRC has teamed with 
[DELETED]  and [DELETED]  to provide the Government with the ultimate combination of 
flexibility, technical expertise, and tailored staffing in Colorado Springs.”   Id.  
Specifically, SRC’s pr oposal states that, in order to “overcome the challenges of staffing 
in the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the Department of Defense [(DOD)],” it has, “[s]ince November 2020, [ ] hired 35 IT professionals in the 
Colorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering.”  Id.  SRC also states that, for 
this task order, it “successfully staffed six uniquely qualified Full -Time Equivalent (FTE) 
IS and Cybersecurity engineering positions --each with Top Secret (TS) security 
clearances and eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) read- in.”  Id.   
 In evaluating SRC’s C2 Cyber  reference, the agency found that “ SRC has demonstrated 
successful staffing and retention in the Colorado Springs area for the Department of Defense”, noting that “[s]ince November 2020, SRC has hired 35 IT professionals in the Colorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering. ”  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 7.  
  Page 11    B-423287; B -423287.2   OSC disagrees with the agency’s evaluation and asserts that SRC’s proposal included 
“an indeterminate number of experience references,” and that the agency unreasonably credited SRC for three years of performance by itself and other companies prior to the beginning of the C2 Cyber  task order.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35.   In response, 
the agency explains that SRC’s proposal simply demonstrated how SRC hired and retained personnel for the C2 Cyber  task order.  Supp. COS/ MOL at 7.  The agency 
maintains that “ [w]hether SRC hired these employees before or during the task order is 
immaterial” because “the fact [is] that [SRC was ] able to hire and retain for performance 
under” the C2 Cyber  task order.  Id.    
 Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  The record reflects  that SRC’s partnerships with the two [DELETED]  companies and the 
hiring discussed in SRC’s C2 Cyber reference was in support of the C2 Cyber  task 
order.  While OSC is correct that the task order in SRC’s C2 Cyber  reference did not 
begin until November 2022, this does not mean that hiring was not conducted in anticipation of the task order.  Although the relevant task order did not begin until 
November 2022, SRC ’s proposal explains that it  started recruiting in November 2020 in 
anticipation of the task order to “overcome the challenges of staffing in the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the [DOD].”  AR, Tab 11, SRC 
Proposal  at 4.  While OSC asserts that SRC should not have received credit for the 
hiring that occurred prior to the start of the task order because the hiring was not done under the task order, as previously noted, the solicitation required offerors to provide “organiz ational experience since 01 July 201 9,” and key area 1 required experience 
hiring and retaining certain engineering professional in the Colorado Springs area.  TORFP at 62 .  The protester neither asserts nor cites to any requirement in the 
solicitation that specified that this hiring and retaining experience had to be obtained 
exclusively during a reference’s period of performance to be relevant or a prohibition on hiring and retaining experience in anticipation of performing a reference contract.  Supp. Comments at 5-12; TORFP at 6 2.  To the extent OSC asserts that it was improper for 
the agency to have considered SRC’s experience in this regard as relevant to SRC’s C2 Cyber task order, the protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation, without 
more, is insufficient to render the agency’s evaluation unreasonable.  This protest ground is denied.   Key Personnel  
 OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposal under the key personnel factor for its proposed senior systems engineer.  OSC also challenges the agency’s evaluation of the qualifications of  its proposed program 
manager , asserting that  OSC’s proposal merited a significant strength, rather than just a 
strength.     Senior Systems Engineer  
 OSC argues that the a gency’s evaluation under the key personnel factor  was 
unreasonable based on the assignment of a weakness for OSC’s proposed senior  Page 12    B-423287; B -423287.2   systems engineer.  OSC alleges that the a gency unreasonably assigned it s proposal  a 
weakness because it concluded that its proposed senior systems engineer  did not meet 
two of the solicitation’s seven desired experience areas  for the position.  Protest 
at 18-26.  OSC contends that the agency’s evaluation was improper because, in its 
view, the resume of its proposed senior systems engineer  “readily meets or exceeds the 
[a]gency’s evaluation criteria” and the a gency either misread or rigidly read OSC’s 
propos al.  Id. at 18. 
 
Under the key personnel factor, the TORFP  identified eight categories of key personnel 
to be evaluated, including as pertinent here a senior systems engineer.9  TORFP  
at 63-66.  The solicitation provided qualifications for each key personnel category.  Id. 
at 63, 65.  For the s enior systems engineer, the solicitation listed seven  desired 
qualifications.  Id.   Relevant here, these desired qualifications  included “[a]t least 5 
years of hands -on professional experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer for 
program/project of similar size and scope,” and “3 years of experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer supporting a DOD program of similar size and scope.”
10  Id. at 65.  
The TORFP required offerors to provide a resume for each identified key person and 
the agency was to evaluate “the extent to which the offeror’s proposed key personnel 
meet and exceed the desired qualifications.”  Id. at 70.   
 The resume included in OSC’s proposal for its proposed senior systems engineer  
provided that the individual had “5+” years of professional experience:  as a “Systems 
Engineer” for [DELETED]  from January 2021 to Present (September 4, 2024); as a 
“Windows System Administrator/Engineer” for [DELETED]  from August 2020 to January 
2021; and as an “Information Security Engineer” for [DELETED]  from October 2019 to 
October 2020.  AR, Tab 9,  OSC Proposal  at 27 -28. 
 
In assigning OSC ’s proposal  a weakness, the a gency found that the proposed 
candidate did not meet the qualifications  identified above for DOD experience and 
collective experience as a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at  46-47.  
In this regard, the agency noted that “[t]he desired collective ( [DOD] or otherwise) 
experience requirement for the position is a least five (5) years of hands -on professional 
 
9 Specifically, the TORFP identified the following key personnel categories:  systems 
architect and information systems lead (KP 1), network architect and network lead 
(KP2), onsite program manager (KP3), senior infrastructure engineer and infrastructure 
lead (KP4), senior cyber engineer and cyber lead (KP5), senior systems engineer 
(KP6), senior network engineer (KP7), and p roject manager (KP8).  TORFP at 61 -64. 
10 The TORFP also identified the following four additional qualifications/experience for 
the senior systems engineer:  a bachelor ’s degree in e ngineering, computer science, or 
an IT related field;  a TS level security clearance with the ability to obtain access to SCI ; 
three years of hands -on professional experience with virtual desktop infrastructure 
(VDI) ; a certified professional (NCP) certification ; and an information assurance 
technical/information assurance manager  (IAT/IAM ) certification, level II or greater.  Id. 
at 61, 63.  Page 13    B-423287; B -423287.2   experience as a Senior Systems Engineer for a program/project of similar size and 
scope.”  Id.  at 46.  The agency explained that the “candidate’s Systems Engineer 
experience was with [DELETED]  as a Windows System Administrator/Engineer from 
08/2020- 01/2021 and with [DELETED] as a Systems Engineer from 01/2021- Present. ”  
Id.  The agency found that the “number of years as a ‘ Senior Systems Engineer ’ cannot 
be adequately determined from the resume as no Senior -level positions were identified” 
and that “[t]his inexperience as a Senior Systems Engineer does not meet the desired [DOD] experience for the position. ”  Id.  The agency also noted that if OSC’s proposed 
candidate “had Senior Systems Engineering experience and did not necessarily meet the desired timeframe, it would be viewed differently;” “[h]owever, not having the necessary experience as a Senior Systems Engineer AND with only four years as a Systems Engineer does not adequately meet the critical desired experience elements for this position. ”  Id. at 46-47.   
 The agency thus concluded that the failure to meet  two of the seven desired 
qualifications increased the risk of unsuccessful performance and warranted a weakness.  Id.  The agency explained that the lack of required experience increased 
risk because “having a Systems Engineer filling a Senior Systems Engineer position . . . will likely require more government oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision 
making and tasks” and “impact OSC Edge’s ability to meet project deadlines” in that the 
individuals filling these senior level positions “are expected to lead and manage their own teams within their functional area.”  Id. at 49.    
 In addition, in response to the protest, the agency explains that  it “does not dispute that 
the proposed engineer did the work as described in the proposal,” but rather that  “the 
nature or type of work performed”  by OSC’s proposed senior systems engineer  as 
described in the resume says nothing about whether the work was done at a senior 
level.  COS/ MOL at 10.  In this regard, the agency notes that a “senior engineer is a 
more experienced engineer with significantly more responsibility often leading projects , 
handling complex problems independently, and mentoring junior engineers.”  Id.  The 
agency explains that OSC’s proposed candidate’s resume “did not call out any higher level technical expertise or leadership experience.”  Id.   The agency states that “OSC's 
proposal identifies his current position as a System Engineer only” and that “the prior work experiences also identify him as a Systems Engineer vice a Senior Systems Engineer.”  Id.  The agency explains that “[h]aving done the work under the guidance of 
a Senior Systems Engineer is not the same as performing and leading as a Senior System Engineer” and that the “work as described years of experience does not de facto lend itself to a conclusion [that the candidate’s] engineering experience was at the 
‘Senior ’ level. ”  Id.  In this regard, the agency explained in response to the protester’s 
debriefing questions that  “the Government was unable to decipher if the proposed 
candidate was performing [the functions identified in the resume] as a [s]enior [s]yst ems 
[e]ngineer, a [s]ystems [e]ngineer, or under the direction of a [s]enior [s]ystems [e]ngineer.”  AR, Tab 4 , Debriefing Response at 5.  
 The protester disagrees with the agency’s evaluation and maintains that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because  Page 14    B-423287; B -423287.2   its evaluation improperly “focus[ed] on job titles alone” and “ ignore[ ed] [the candidate’s] 
qualifications and experiences on the senior level that was detailed in his resume.”  
Supp. Comments  at 4, 26.   
 Based on our review we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency’s evaluation.  The record reflects that this key person’s resume described the candidate as a systems engineer rather than a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 27 -28.  
The agency concluded, based on the language in the resume, that it could not determine the number of years of the individual’s experience as a senior systems engineer.   AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 46.   Offerors are  responsible for drafting a well -
written proposal that allow s for meaningful review by the a gency .  Abacus Tech. Corp. ; 
SMS Data Products Grp., Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 201 6, 2016 CPD ¶ 317 at 17.   
Here, OSC’s  proposal did not reflect the information that OSC apparently intended to 
convey .  In assigning OSC a weakness for this aspect of its proposal, the a gency 
considered all of th e proposed key individual’s  experience and reasonably concluded 
that experience increased the risk of unsuccessful performance because his resume did not clearly indicate three years of experience as a senior systems engineer supporting 
DOD and five years of overall experience as a senior systems engineer.  Although OSC 
may disagree with the a gency’s substantive assessment that OSC did not clearly 
demonstrate the required years of senior level experience, its disagreement with the agency’s judgment, without  more, is insufficient to establish that the a gency acted 
unreasonably.   
 OSC also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because the TORFP referred to the qualifications as 
desired, rather than required.  Protest at 26.  We note, however , that the TORFP 
provided that the agency ’s evaluation of proposed key personnel would “consider the 
extent to which the offeror’s proposed key personnel meet and exceed the desired qualifications ,” TORFP  at 70, and as discussed above, we find reasonable the agency’s 
evaluation that the failure of OSC’s proposal to demonstrate that its proposed senior 
systems engineer had the desired years of experience as a senior systems engineer increases the risk of unsuccessful performance because  it will likely require more 
government oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision making and tasks and 
may impact OSC’s ability to meet project deadlines .  Accordingly, it was reasonable for 
the agency to label its concern regarding OSC’s ability to meet the desired qualifications as a weakness.   This protest ground is denied.  
  Project Manager  
 OSC also argues that the agency acted unreasonably when it assigned a strength versus a significant strength to its proposed project manager.  Protest at 27.  
Specifically, OSC asserts that rather than assess ing an overall strength for  its proposed 
project manager based on the finding that the project manager exceeded two of the desired qualifications, the agency should have found that  the project manager exceeded 
at least five of the six desired qualifications for that key personnel category and assigned  a significant strength.  Based on our review of the record, we find nothing  Page 15    B-423287; B -423287.2   unreasonable regarding the agency’s assessment of a strength, rather than a significant 
strength, for OSC’s proposed project manager.  However, even if the agency erred in this regard, the protester has failed to show that it was competitively prejudiced by any such error.   
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency ’s improper 
actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  CACI, Inc. -

 Here, even if the agency erred its evaluation and should have found OSC’s proposed project manager  to exceed five of the six desired requirements for the position, leading 
to a significant strength, rather than a strength,  OSC has not demonstrated  that, but for 
this error, it s proposal, which was lower rated than SRC’s under both the organizational 
experience and key personnel factors and which had only a slightly lower evaluated cost,  would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.   Accordingly , we 
conclude that the protester has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency’s assignment of a strength instead of a significant strength and find no basis to 
sustain the protest.  
 Best-Value Determination 
 Finally, OSC argues that because the underlying evaluation was flawed, the agency ’s 
best-value determination was unreasonable.  This allegation is based on the protester ’s 
challenges to the agency ’s evaluation, all of which we have denied as set forth above.  
Thus, we dismiss this allegation because the allegations do not establish an 
independent basis of protest.  Advanced Alliant Solutions Team, LLC , B-417334,

where the record shows the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with law, 
regulation, and the terms of the solicitation.   
DECISION  
 Kratos Defense & Rocket Support Services, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of a task order to Salient CRGT, Inc., of Fairfax, Virginia, under request for quotations  (RFQ) No. N0018924R3085, issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval 
Supply Systems Command, for educational support services  and logistical support 
services for the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF)  at multiple locations in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia.  Kratos contends that the Navy misevaluated quotations  and made an 
unreasonable source selection decision.   
 We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The Navy issued the RFQ on July 25, 2024, to firms holding the Navy’s SeaPort Next 
Generation multiple- award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts , and 
designated the procurement a fair opportunity competition pursuant to Federal DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423376 et al.   Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505(b).  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFQ  
amend. 3 at 5.1  The RFQ  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order 
for a base year  and four option years, plus an option for 15 days of demobilization 
services to facilitate a transition to a successor contractor.  AR, Tab 1, RFQ at 52.   The 
RFQ incorporated a performance work statement (PWS) that described the scope of the 
task order as assisting the N aval Education and Training Security Assistance Field 
Activity  (NETSAFA) by providing RSNF support services that would include training and 
education, engineering, technical , and management support .  Id. at 16.  These services 
are to focus on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of directly supporting “ the 
RSNF ’s objective to remain the dominant Naval Force within the Middle East ,” and are 
to include support for “all levels of in -Kingdom RSNF training and other logistical and 
advisory support .”  Id.   
 
The RFQ  provided for quotations2 to be evaluated under three factors .  The first, 
performance approach, was more important than the second, past performance, and together those were more important than the third, cost.  RFQ at 51.  The successful 
vendor would be selected using a best value tradeoff among those factors.  Id.  
 For the performance approach factor, the RFQ instructed vendors to describe the firm ’s 
approach only under five specific PWS task elements , four of which are relevant here:  
 
• PWS 1.1.2, which required the vendor to m anage teams of task order 
support personnel at multiple geographically dispersed locations.    
• PWS 2.1.1.1, which required the vendor to “ [a]ssist the RSNF in the 
establishment of a central Curriculum Management organization within the Learning Education Center in Riyadh with a focus on Learning Standards and Quality Control .” 
• PWS 2.1.1.3, which required the vendor to “perform annual analysis of 
the state of the RSNF Curriculum Management process and provide results and recommendation of Short (12/24 month) and Long (3-5 year) term goals ,” and then deliver a report with the results .   
• PWS 5, which required the vendor to offer a program “to hire Saudi 
Arabian Nationals  . . . in support of the new Saudi Arabian 2030 Vision 
Plan through performance of this requirement ,” so that the vendor 
would maintain  a “minimum rating of ‘ Medium Green’  in the Saudi 
 
1 The solicitation was issued as a request for proposals but is referred to as an RFQ in 
amendment 1.  Vendors ’ submissions are referred to as both quotations and proposals 
in the evaluation record and in the parties ’ protest filings.  For consistency, we refer to 
the solicitation as an RFQ and to the vendors ’ submissions as quotations.  
2 The Navy previously determined that three of seven interested firms were considered 
to be “ viable ” sources based on their experience, commitment, and eligibility to operate 
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and invited those three to submit quotations.    Page 3    B-423376 et al.   Nitaqat Mutawar Program ” and meet the corresponding requirements 
of the national social insurance program.   
 
RFQ at 16- 20, 46.   
The RFQ also expressly advised vendors that they could “ provide any other information 
considered relevant to the solicitation and PWS tasks .”  Id. at 46.   
 Under the past performance factor, the RFQ directed vendors to submit three past performance references with the same or similar scope and magnitude that would be evaluated to assess “ how capable the [vendor] is of successfully accomplishing the 
requirements of the solicitation. ”  Id. at 46- 47.  
 For the cost factor, which is not at issue here, the RFQ directed vendors to submit target costs and target fees using a web form, and documentation substantiating the 
realism of the vendor ’s direct labor rates  and indirect rates .  Id. at 48 -49.  
 The three quotations the Navy received were from Salient
3, Kratos , and a third firm that 
is not at issue here.  A technical evaluation board (TEB) reviewed the quotations , 
identified strengths and weaknesses in each vendor ’s proposed approach under the 
performance approach factor, and assessed adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, 
acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  AR, Tab 4, TEB Memorandum4 at 5.  The TEB 
also evaluated each vendor ’s past performance to assess first the relevance of each 
reference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant, and then all 
references together in aggregate.  The TEB then assess ed each vendor ’s record of 
performance under its relevant contracts , which was expressed in terms of a level of 
confidence in the vendor performing successfully .  The past performance evaluation 
resulted in adjectival ratings that included substantial confidence, satisfactory 
confidence, and limited confidence.  Id. at 5-6.   
 
The Navy identified two weaknesses in the Kratos ’s approach under the performance 
approach factor.  The first weakness concerned Kratos ’s approach to managing teams 
of personnel under PWS section 1.1.2 that included having the firm ’s managers 
communicate with RSNF leadership about academic schedules and requirements 
without including NETSAFA.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  6-7.  The s econd weakness 
concerned the firm’ s approach to supporting curriculum management under PWS 
sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 by proposi ng the use of Kratos ’s proprietary software, 
referred to as [DELETED] , rather than commercial ly available software .  The TEB 
explained that the use of proprietary software created a risk of vendor lock -in, a 
situation where RSNF curriculum management would become reliant on the proprietary

memorandum to the contracting officer, which described the evaluation process and summarized the results.    Page 4    B-423376 et al.   software and would complicate efforts to achieve future competition for the requirement.  
Id. at 9.  Although the TEB also identified strengths in Kratos ’s approach regarding the 
same PWS requirements,  it determined the quotation merited an overall rating of 
acceptable under the performance approach factor.  Id.  at 12-13.   
In contrast, the TEB ’s evaluation of Salient ’s quotation found the firm ’s approach 
showed exceptional understanding and demonstrated the ability to exceed program 
requirements.  Id. at 19 -21.  The evaluation identified multiple strengths and no 
weaknesses, which the TEB determined merited an overall rating of outstanding under 
the performance approach factor .  Id. at 29-30.  
 In evaluating Kratos under the past performance factor, the Navy determined that two of 
the firm’ s past performance examples were very relevant, and one was somewhat 
relevant, and that  when considered in aggregate, they were very relevant.  AR, Tab 3, 
TEB Report at 15- 16.  The evaluators reviewed the assessments received from a point 
of contact for each relevant contract along with past performance database ratings.  Those reports were uniformly positive for Kratos and thus provided a high degree of confidence that Kratos would perform successfully.  The agency consequently assigned 
the quotation a rating of substantial confidence.  Id. at 17.  
 For Salient, the evaluators found one of its three past performance references was very relevant, while two were somewhat relevant.  Id.  at 30- 31.  Of those, the very relevant 
contract was the incumbent task order, which the evaluators described as being performed by “[t]he quoter . . . as the prime contractor .”  Id. at 29.  When considered i n 
aggregate, the evaluators viewed Salient ’s past performance as very relevant.  Id.  at 31.  
The record of past performance on the contracts identified in Salient ’s quotation was 
uniformly positive, and gave the evaluators a high degree of confidence that Salient would perform successfully and thus the agency assigned a rating of substantial 
confidence.  Id.  at 33.  
 The resulting adjectival ratings and evaluated costs  were as follows :

 AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 30.    
The contracting officer, who served as the source selection authority, reviewed and agreed with the evaluation report.  The contracting officer summarized the strengths in both firms ’ quotations, as well as the two weaknesses in Kratos ’s quotation under the 
performance approach factor and summarized the basis for both firm ’s past 
performance ratings.  AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 10- 12.  The 
contracting officer then made a comparative analysis  of the benefits of Salient ’s  Page 5    B-423376 et al.   approach and contrasted them with the evaluation of Kratos ’s quotation as generally 
adequate and providing strengths that were offset by its weaknesses.  Id. at 30-31.  The 
contracting officer then summarized the past performance of both and concluded that 
both firms merited a rating of substantial confidence.  Id.  at 32- 33.   
 Finally,  the contracting officer set out the source selection judgment that Salient ’s 
quotation demonstrated significant superiority over Kratos ’s under the performance 
approach factor, and a slight advantage under the past performance factor because its 
longer period of very relevant performance.  Id. at 33.  The contracting officer explained 
that Salient ’s advantage justified incurring the 8 percent higher evaluated cost, and 
therefore Salient ’s quotation represented the best value for the government , particularly 
in view of the importance of the work to the security cooperation between the Navy and RSNF .  Id. at 34.  After receiving notice of the source selection and a brief explanation 
of the selection decision, Kratos filed this protest.
5   
DISCUSSION  Kratos challenges the evaluation of both firms ’ quotations under the performance 
approach and past performance factors as unreasonable, argues that the Navy 
disparately  evaluat ed quotations , and contends that the source selection tradeoff 
decision was unreasonable.  We consider the protester ’s arguments in turn and find that 
the record does not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   
 
Performance Approach Evaluation  
 
Kratos argues that its quotation was misevaluated under the performance approach 
factor by the assessment of the two weaknesses and by the Navy ’s failure to recognize 
additional strengths in its proposed approach.  T he firm also argues that the evaluation 
reflects disparate treatment because the Navy assessed strengths for aspects of 
Salient ’s approach that both quotations had in common but failed to assess Kratos ’s 
quotation similarly.   
 
Where a protester challenges an agency ’s evaluation of quotations  in a task or delivery 
order competition under FAR subpart 16.5, our Office does not reevaluate quotations; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the evaluation criteria and the applicable procurement laws and 
regulations.  Wyle Labs., Inc. , B-416528.2, Jan. 11, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 19 at 4.  The 
evaluation of risk associated with specific aspects of  a vendor ’s proposed approach is 
proper even where risk may not have been specifically identified as an element of the 
evaluation.   Id. at 6.  Ultimately, a vendor  bears the obligation to submit a well -written 
quotation to clearly demonstrate its approach and its compliance with the solicitation 
requirements.   Manutek Inc. , B-422096, B -422096.2, Jan. 5, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 22 at  8.   
 
5 Our Office is authorized to hear protests of task orders that are issued under multiple-
award IDIQ contracts established within defense agencies where, as here,  the task 
order is valued in excess of $3 5 million.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1).   Page 6    B-423376 et al.   Evaluation of Weaknesses  
 
Kratos argues that the Navy misevaluated its  quotation by assessing a  weakness for 
posing a risk that Kratos would commit to work beyond the task order scope or agree to 
unauthorized commitments .  Protest at 8 -9.  In this regard, under the evaluation for 
PWS section 1.1.2, which addressed the vendor ’s management  of its teams ( often 
referred to in the record simply as program management) , the Navy assessed a 
weakness because Kratos ’s quotation described having the firm ’s managers 
communicate with RSNF  personnel to determine program requirements .  By proposing 
contact directly with RSNF  and without involv ement of NETSAFA  to establish those 
requirements , the evaluators found Kratos ’s approach posed  a risk of the firm 
performing requirements that exceed those required by the task order .  AR, Tab 3, TEB 
Report at 7.  The agency  deemed that aspect of the quotation a risk that constituted a 
weakness in the firm’s approach.   Id.  
 Kratos contends that the assessment of this weakness was unreasonable because the Navy  misread the approach described in the firm ’s quotation.  Protest at 8.  Kratos 
argues that when the quotation indicated direct contact with RSNF, the broader approach the firm proposed placed communication with the Navy first, and never 
indicated that the firm would fail to involve the Navy or that the firm would take direction 
from RSNF.  Id.  Instead, Kratos emphasizes that its quotation stated that the firm would 
[DELETED ].”  Id. (quoting Kratos Quotation vol. I at 4
6).  Further , Kratos argues that its 
quotation “[DELETED] ,” thereby committing to replicate its “ successful communication 
plan . . . during [its] last contract, ”7 whereas the evaluation was based only on an out -of-
context reading of one sentence.  Id. at 6; Comments & Supp. Protest at 6 ; Second 
Supp. Comments at 2 .   
The Navy responds that the evaluation of this  weakness was based on the description 
of the firm’ s approach in its quotation and was reasonable.  In particular, t he agency 
notes that the approach stated that Kratos ’s approach was to have its functional 
managers communicat e with RSNF about requirements and then, only afterward , seek  
final approval from NETSAFA.  Contrary to Kratos ’s assertion that the evaluators 
misread the quotation, the agency argues that the “ non-cost/technical quote, made no 
mention of NETSAFA ’s involvement in its planned communications with RSNF 
leadership. ”  Contracting Officer ’s Statement  and Memorandum of Law ( COS/ MOL ) 
at 18.  Therefore, the agency contends, it was reasonable for  the e valuators to conclude 
that Kratos ’s approach would risk leaving NETSAFA out of a discussion with RSNF 
leadership, which posed the risk of making commitments to RSNF that expanded the 
scope of work , made unauthorized commitments, or disrupted the chain of command.   
AR, Tab 8, Decl. of Technical Evaluation Board Chair at 7.   To the extent that the 
 
6 Citation s to the vendors ’ quotations refer to documents filed as  Electronic Protest 
Docketing System No.  36 (agency response to additional documents request).   
7 Kratos had been the incumbent contractor until 2021.    Page 7    B-423376 et al.   protester argues that its approach  was misunderstood, the agency counters that the 
language of the quotation was at best unclear.  Second Supp. MOL at  7.   
 
The record reasonably supports the Navy ’s evaluation.  The Kratos quotation describes 
what the agency understood as distinct elements  because they were set forth in 
separate sentences .  Among them was that the firm’ s functional managers would 
“[DELETED] ”  Kratos Quotation vol. I at 3.  NETSAFA is not mentioned in this sentence.  
The quotation stated the firm would then [ DELETED] .”  Id. at 4.  The Navy ’s conclusion 
that Kratos ’s approach posed a risk of developing a work plan that included 
commitments that NETSAFA had not authorized, work that was outside the scope of the contract, and disruption in the relationship between the Navy and RSNF was reasonable and based on the content of Kratos ’s quotation.   As noted above, Kratos 
had the responsibility to submit a clear and well -written quotation.  Manutek Inc. , supra.   
The record thus supports the Navy ’s evaluation judgment in assessing a weakness in 
Kratos ’s quotation.
8  While the evaluation characterized the weakness as being offset 
by the firm ’s general emphasis on open communication with NETSAFA, the net effect 
still contributed to the overall assessment of Kratos ’s quotation as acceptable under the 
performance approach factor.  COS/ MOL at 17.  Consequently, the evaluators and, 
subsequently, the contracting officer , properly consider ed the weakness in their overall 
assessment of the merit of Kratos ’s quotation under the performance approach factor.   
 Kratos next argues that the assessment of the second weakness under the 
performance approach factor was unreasonable.  As noted above, the TEB assessed a weakness based on the quotation describing the use of Kratos ’s proprietary software in 
 
8 Kratos also argues that the evaluation reflects disparate treatment because Salient ’s 
quotation was not assessed a weakness even though it also allegedly proposed communication with RSNF that did not include NETSAFA , and because Kratos ’s 
quotation was not assessed a strength, as Salient ’s was, for its substantively 
indistinguishable communications plan.  Second Supp. Protest at 3-5.  Where a 
protester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the offerors ’ proposals  (or 
quotations) .  Paragon Sys., Inc.; S ecTek, Inc. , B-409066.2, B -409066.3, June 4, 2014, 
2014 CPD ¶ 169 at 8- 9.   
The record supports the Navy ’s explanation that even though each quotation had “ a 
similar overall concept of coordinated and frequent communication, ” Salient ’s was more 
detailed and beneficial.  Second Supp. Decl. of TEB Chair at 3.  For example, Salient ’s 
approach clearly emphasized its use of steady informal communication to keep 
NETSAFA updated about its operations, while Kratos ’s relied on standard formal 
updates to the agency.  Id.  Given what the Navy  notes is added complexity of operating 
across geographically dispersed sites  and interacting with RSNF, the agency explains 
that it viewed Salient ’s approach as providing better visibility into the contractor ’s 
performance that provided an important advantage over Kratos ’s formal communication 
structure.  Id.  Given the differences in the approaches, Kratos has not shown that the 
evaluation reflected disparate treatment.    Page 8    B-423376 et al.   support of the curriculum management requirements , which were required under 
sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 of the PWS .  The evaluators deemed the approach a 
weakness because it would foster reliance on Kratos ’s proprietary software systems 
that would then complicate efforts to recompete the requirement .  Kratos argues that the 
Navy again misread the firm ’s quotation, which it argues only described the planned use 
of its proprietary software as part of an effort that supports [ DELETED] , separate from 
the perf ormance of the contract at issue.  Protest at 9- 12; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 8-9.   
 
Kratos argues  that its quotation only mentioned the proprietary software to explain the 
firm’s involvement with [ DELETED]  as a basis to recommend that NETSAFA work with 
[DELETED ] to gain the benefit of its training opportunities and access to its [DELETED] .  
Kratos argues that its quotation did not propose to implement its proprietary software in the performance of the task order at issue, so assessing a weakness for that approach 
was baseless and thus unreasonable.  Id.   Further, Kratos argues that even if the Navy 
was reasonable to read the quotation as proposing the use of the proprietary software on the task order at issue, it was still unreasonable to assess a weakness because Kratos was at most recommending that  the agency use its proprietary software, and that 
NETSAFA could simpl y decline to adopt that recommendation.  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at  6.   
 The Navy argues that its evaluation was reasonable.  The agency contends  that the 
language of Kratos ’s quotation specifically recommends the use of its [ DELETED]  
proprietary software in its performance approach narrative responding to PWS sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3.  COS/ MOL at 19.   That is, the firm did not simply mention its 
proprietary software, but specifically recommended its use as its performance approach under the curriculum management tasks.  Id.  The agency contends that its reading of 
the quotation was reasonable, and its concern about adopting Kratos ’s proposed 
approach to curriculum management as effectively locking in Kratos ( through 
institutionalizing the use of its proprietary software)  is reasonable and supports the 
assessment of the weakness .  Id. at 20 (citing AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at 7 -8). 
 Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evalua tion.  In its 
quotation, the passage at issue appears  to state that Kratos ’s approach to the task 
order at issue involves the use of its propriet ary software:   
 
[DELETED ]. 
 Kratos Quotation vol. I at 6.   
 An agency may reasonably consider the risks of an approach to performance that relies on proprietary software in its evaluation.  Comprehensive Health Servs., Inc. , 
B-292858.3 et al. , April 27, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶  165 at 6 -7 (agency reasonably 
downgraded protester ’s proposal based on concern that the proposed implementa tion 
and use of proprietary software “pose [d] obvious risks with regard to, among other 
things, a successor contract ”).  Here, the Navy  understood Kratos ’s approach to the  Page 9    B-423376 et al.   task order at issue as making a recommendation for aligning the curriculum 
development for RSNF with the resources and capabilities at [ DELETED] , which Kratos 
described as including its proprietary software system  as key intellectual property .  
Kratos Quotation vol. I at 6.  As a result, t he Navy  was reasonable in assessing a 
weakness based on an approach that recommended the use of Kratos ’s proprietary 
software solution.9   
Failure to Assign Strengths  
 Kratos next argues that the Navy misevaluated multiple aspects of its quotation that 
should have resulted in the assessment of additional strengths  under the performance 
approach factor .   
 Where an evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria, the protester ’s assertion that its proposal  (or quotation, as here) should have been 
assessed additional strengths under a factor does not demonstrate an unreasonable evaluation;  rather, the protester ’s arguments simply constitute disagreement with the 
agency ’s evaluation judgments  that do not provide a basis to sustain the protest .  
GeoNorth LLC , B-411473 et al. , Aug. 6, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 247 at 7.  As described 
below, the evaluation record documents careful review of the protester ’s proposed 
approach to the curriculum management and local employment plan requirements and considered judgment that the aspects that Kratos contends should have been additional strengths were not valuable to the Navy and thus did not merit additional strengths.  The protester ’s arguments to the contrary do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   
Kratos argues that its ongoing role as the RSNF training systems support contractor  
uniquely allowed it to leverage the abilities of Kratos ’s subject matter experts who are 
involved in providing integration work for the Naval Tactical Team Trainer (NTTT)  and 
other new systems, and that Kratos could further provide the benefits of graphics and simulation content  created using the NTTT system if the Navy were to develop or 
update interactive media resources under the task order at issue.  Kratos argues that 
the Navy unreasonabl y failed to assess an additional strength for proposing those 
benefits.  Protest at 12- 13; Comments & Supp. Protest at 12 .  
 The Navy argues that the evaluation reasonably determined that Kratos ’s quotation did 
not merit assessment of an additional strength with respect to Kratos ’s role as the 
 
9 Although Kratos contends that Salient likewise proposed to rely on proprietary 
software solutions , for which it disparately received a strength,  the record does not 
support this contention.  The Navy counters that the strength assessed for Salient ’s 
software systems, identified as “[DELETED]” and “[DELETED] ,” are both commercially 
available programs sold by third parties, which therefore present  no similar risk of 
vendor lock -in because licenses to both systems could be transferred to,  or be acquired 
by, a successor contractor through ordinary commercial means .  Second Supp. Decl. of 
TEB Chair at  4-5.  The record thus does not provide a basis to find that the evaluation 
involved disparate treatment here.    Page 10    B-423376 et al.   RSNF training systems support contractor .  Regarding the firm’ s proposed approach of 
leveraging that effort to provide expertise, graphics, and simulations, the agency 
counters that the evaluators reasonabl y found the requirements of this task order would 
not benefit from the types of expertise, or the graphics and simulations , that are  
produced by NTTT or other systems  under the training systems support work .  Further , 
the agency notes that even if there were potential crossover benefits from the RSNF 
training systems support contract, the advantages  would once again raise risks of 
creating dependencies to Kratos proprietary software systems , and NTTT specifically , 
so the risk of vendor lock -in would have been a weakness rather than a strength.  
COS/ MOL at 21.   
 Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation 
judgment.  The record shows that the evaluators  specifically considered the firm ’s ability 
to leverage ownership of the NTTT software, and made a judgment that it was not considered a benefit at least in part because the scope of the task order at issue did not 
include use of simulation training.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.  Kratos supports its 
claim that the ownership of the NTTT software would benefit the Navy by arguing that it 
would make the firm ’s efforts more efficient, such as if Kratos were to prepare 
interactive multimedia under PWS sections 2.1.1.6 or 2.1.4.  Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 10.  Kratos ’s argument does not demonstrate that the evaluation under the RFQ 
criteria was unreasonable, however,  particularly because those PWS tasks were not 
among the five that the RFQ identified as being evaluated under the performance approach factor.  See RFQ at  46.  Rather, the record supports the reasonableness of 
the agency ’s judgment because the evaluators considered the potential benefit of 
Kratos ’s software and found the NTTT software (including its ownership by Kratos ) 
would not provide significant value to the agency under the evaluation criteria for this 
task order.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.   
 Kratos also argues that its quotation should also have been assessed a strength under 
the evaluation element for section 5 of the PWS,  regarding a plan to meet local 
requirements to employ Saudi nationals , because the firm had platinum status in the 
Nitaqat Mutawar program , which requires employment of Saudi nationals .  Kratos 
argues that its rating exceeded the RFQ requirement that the vendor had to maintain a minimum of a “ [m]edium [g]reen”  rating.  P rotest at 13.  The firm argues that the Navy 
unreasonably overlooked a significant benefit of  its higher platinum rating because 
attaining it made it less likely that through loss of qualifying employees, Kratos would be 
downgraded below medium green.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at 10- 11.  The firm  
also argues that the Navy improperly treated the requirement as pass/fail, rather than 
recognizing the advantage of Kratos ’s platinum status under the program, which would 
have justified the assessment of a strength based on the lower risk that Kratos would be downgraded below the PWS requirement of medium green.  Id.  at 10.    
 The Navy argues that the evaluation was reasonable because the RFQ required an 
approach to maint ain a minimum rating of “[m]edium [g]reen”  and comply with the social 
insurance program.  The agency contends that whether a vendor ’s approach ensured 
the firm would attain a medium green rating,  or would attain a higher rating,  the  Page 11    B-423376 et al.   approach provided equal value because platinum status provided no additional benefits  
to the Navy.  AR, Tab 8, Decl. of TEB Chair at 9; COS/ MOL at 22.  T he Navy also 
argues that the evaluators properly considered Kratos ’s four-element plan regarding 
PWS section 5, of which one element was for the firm to exceed only slightly the 
minimum local employment required to maintain medium green status for the task order 
at issue (i.e., the firm clarified that it would achieve a Saudization rate of [DELETED] 
percent on the task order, thereby exceeding the medium green requirement of 
38.81 percent).  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 12.  The Navy  also considered other 
elements of the firm’ s approach that addressed successful recruiting and monitoring of 
employment and payroll compliance.  Id.  at 12-13.  In considering the plan as a whole, 
the evaluators reasonably deemed it adequate based on the firm ’s focus on candidate 
recruitment and monitoring compliance.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 13.   
 Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation here.  
Kratos ’s quotation states that the firm “currently hold[s] Platinum status ” in the Nitaqat 
Mutawar program, and then describes its proposed approach to the requirements of 
section 5 of the PWS as including a goal to maintain sufficient qualifying employees to 
attain medium green status.  Kratos Quotation vol. I at  10.  The Navy has explained why 
platinum status did not afford any additional benefit to the agency and, in our view, the evaluators reasonably  determined that a strength was not justified.    
 Even if the Navy improperly assess ed vendors ’ Nitaqat Mutawar program status b y 
treating the offerors ’ proposed approaches  as a pass/fail evaluation, the record shows 
that Kratos was not prejudiced by that  evaluation.   Our Office will not sustain a protest 
unless the protester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the 
agency ’s actions, that is, unless the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency ’s 
actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  McDon ald-Bradley , B-270126, Feb. 8, 1996, 96- 1 CPD ¶ 54 at 3.   The record does not 
support Kratos ’s claim that its quotation exceeded the minimum standard in the RFQ ; 
rather, while it presently has platinum status, its proposed approach is to attain medium green status .  As a result, even if the agency had rated vendors higher for proposing an 
approach that surpassed the requirement to maintain medium green status, Kratos has not shown that its approach did so and could reasonably have been rated higher than acceptable.   The protester has thus failed to show that the Navy evaluation was 
unreasonable when it assessed Kratos ’s proposed approach, which set a goal of 
qualifying for medium green status under the task order at issue.  The record does not show that Kratos ’s approach provided additional value to the agency.   
 Past Performance Evaluation  
 Kratos challenges the evaluation of Salient ’s past performance, arguing that the Navy 
improperly credited Salient with the past performance of its affiliates , specifically past 
performance by Salient ’s corporate parent and by the incumbent contractor , Salient 
Federal SGIS, which is Salient ’s subsidiary.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  Kratos 
argues that the record does not reflect any recognition by the Navy that the past  Page 12    B-423376 et al.   performance was for affiliated companies or that it was properly considered in 
assessing Salient ’s past performance.  Id.   
 
The Navy responds that the past performance evaluation was reasonable and properly considered the past performance of Salient ’s affiliates because the agency understood 
that Salient was fully involved in performance of the incumbent contract, and the 
quotation described specific resources that Salient would use to perform as being the 
same that were performing the incumbent contract.  Supp. COS at 2.   The agency also 
argues  that Salient and its affiliates are operationally united, and the resources of both 
affiliates were committed to performance of the task order at issue here.  Supp. MOL at 10-11.  The TEB chair confirms that even though the past performance evaluation 
record did not expressly explain the circumstances , the panel was aware that Salient ’s 
affiliate was the awardee of the incumbent contract, and that Salient ’s quotation 
reflected continued use of the incumbent ’s resources, including Salient committing  to 
continue all incumbent employees at their current salaries .  More generally , the 
evaluators were aware that Salient and its corporate affiliates (its parent and its subsidiary) were closely aligned through shared personnel and resources  and were 
effectively performing as one entity under the umbrella of Salient ’s parent .  Supp. AR, 
Second Decl. of TEB Chair at 2- 3; Supp. COS at  2-4.  The Navy argues that the 
agency’s past performance evaluation properly considered performance of the affiliates 
in evaluating Salient under the past performance factor based on the recognition of the close connection between the affiliated entities.   
The evaluation of past performance is a matter of discretion which our Office will not 
disturb unless the agency ’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the 
solicitation criteria .  In a protest  challenging the evaluation of past performance, our 
Office will review the record to determine if the evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the solicitation ’s evaluation criteria and procurement law and 
regulations .  Computer Scis. Corp. , B-409386.2, B -409386.3, Jan. 8, 2015, 2015 CPD 
¶ 34 at 12.  An agency properly may attribute the past performance of a parent or 
affiliated company to an offeror where the firm ’s proposal (or quotation) demonstrates 
that the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  
Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 92 at 14.   
 
Our review of the record shows that  the Navy justifi ed including in the evaluation of 
Salient ’s past performance contracts awarded to its parent and its subsidiary  because 
the agency reasonably viewed the three firms as operationally united and identified 
resources of the incumbent that were committed to performance of the task order at issue .  The agency recognized a significant connection through three elements 
identified in the quotation:  continued use of a training facility from the incumbent contract , a facility it had established in Saudi Arabia, and a corporate leadership cell .  
Salient Quotation vol. I at 3- 4.  The quotation also described Salient as successfully 
performing the incumbent contract and portrayed the three firms as operationally 
unified.  Id.  at 3.  The quotation named the key incumbent leadership personnel as 
continuing in their respective positions and explained its staffing for other positions as retaining many named incumbent employees , who would keep their employment 
certification status and current salaries  for the base year of the task order at issue.  Id.   Page 13    B-423376 et al.   at 4; Salient Cost Quotation at 8- 9.  Finally, Salient and its affiliates share the same 
corporate address and are listed as being affiliated in their SAM.gov records.  Supp. 
MOL at 2.   
 The TEB chair reasonably explains that the evaluators recognized  the description in the 
quotation as consistent with the firms ’ unified management under the umbrella of the 
parent company , and that the quotation indicated that the unified resources of the firms 
would perform the task order at issue.   Supp. AR , Second Decl. of TEB Chair at 1, 3.   In 
our view, the circumstances provide a sufficient basis for the Navy evaluators to consider the performance of both Salient ’s parent and its subsidiary in the pas t 
performance evaluation.   
 Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Finally, Kratos challenges the Navy ’s tradeoff rationale in selecting Salient ’s higher -
rated and higher -priced quotation for award.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 11.  In its 
initial protest and comments, Kratos contended that the source selection rationale relie d 
improperly on adjectival ratings and the number of strengths and weaknesses assessed in the evaluation, rather than on the underlying merits of the quotations, to justify incurring $11.6 million of additional evaluated costs in selecting Salient ’s quotation.  Id.  
at 12 n.4.   
 However, after Kratos filed its comments, the Navy submitted additional relevant documents, which included an unredacted copy of its business clearance memorandum , and those provided previously -redacted portions of the contracting 
officer ’s source selection rationale.  In response, Kratos re focused its challenge to the 
best-value tradeoff:  In its second supplemental comments, Kratos argues that the 
source selection decision was flawed because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable evaluation and unequal treatment of both quotations.  A s explained 
above, our review of the record shows that the Navy ’s evaluations under the 
performance approach and past performance factors were  reasonable and that the 
allegedly unequal evaluation was justified by material differences in the quotations.   In 
sum, the allegation lacks a factual basis because the evaluation it was based on was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Accordingly, Kratos’s challenge to the 
best-value tradeoff is denied.

DIGEST  
 Protest that agency misevaluated quotations and made an unreasonable source selection decision to issue task order to higher -rated and higher -cost vendor is denied 
where the record shows the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with law, 
regulation, and the terms of the solicitation.   
DECISION  
 Kratos Defense & Rocket Support Services, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of a task order to Salient CRGT, Inc., of Fairfax, Virginia, under request for quotations  (RFQ) No. N0018924R3085, issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval 
Supply Systems Command, for educational support services  and logistical support 
services for the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF)  at multiple locations in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia.  Kratos contends that the Navy misevaluated quotations  and made an 
unreasonable source selection decision.   
 We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The Navy issued the RFQ on July 25, 2024, to firms holding the Navy’s SeaPort Next 
Generation multiple- award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts , and 
designated the procurement a fair opportunity competition pursuant to Federal DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423376 et al.   Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505(b).  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFQ  
amend. 3 at 5.1  The RFQ  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order 
for a base year  and four option years, plus an option for 15 days of demobilization 
services to facilitate a transition to a successor contractor.  AR, Tab 1, RFQ at 52.   The 
RFQ incorporated a performance work statement (PWS) that described the scope of the 
task order as assisting the N aval Education and Training Security Assistance Field 
Activity  (NETSAFA) by providing RSNF support services that would include training and 
education, engineering, technical , and management support .  Id. at 16.  These services 
are to focus on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of directly supporting “ the 
RSNF ’s objective to remain the dominant Naval Force within the Middle East ,” and are 
to include support for “all levels of in -Kingdom RSNF training and other logistical and 
advisory support .”  Id.   
 
The RFQ  provided for quotations2 to be evaluated under three factors .  The first, 
performance approach, was more important than the second, past performance, and together those were more important than the third, cost.  RFQ at 51.  The successful 
vendor would be selected using a best value tradeoff among those factors.  Id.  
 For the performance approach factor, the RFQ instructed vendors to describe the firm ’s 
approach only under five specific PWS task elements , four of which are relevant here:  
 
• PWS 1.1.2, which required the vendor to m anage teams of task order 
support personnel at multiple geographically dispersed locations.    
• PWS 2.1.1.1, which required the vendor to “ [a]ssist the RSNF in the 
establishment of a central Curriculum Management organization within the Learning Education Center in Riyadh with a focus on Learning Standards and Quality Control .” 
• PWS 2.1.1.3, which required the vendor to “perform annual analysis of 
the state of the RSNF Curriculum Management process and provide results and recommendation of Short (12/24 month) and Long (3-5 year) term goals ,” and then deliver a report with the results .   
• PWS 5, which required the vendor to offer a program “to hire Saudi 
Arabian Nationals  . . . in support of the new Saudi Arabian 2030 Vision 
Plan through performance of this requirement ,” so that the vendor 
would maintain  a “minimum rating of ‘ Medium Green’  in the Saudi 
 
1 The solicitation was issued as a request for proposals but is referred to as an RFQ in 
amendment 1.  Vendors ’ submissions are referred to as both quotations and proposals 
in the evaluation record and in the parties ’ protest filings.  For consistency, we refer to 
the solicitation as an RFQ and to the vendors ’ submissions as quotations.  
2 The Navy previously determined that three of seven interested firms were considered 
to be “ viable ” sources based on their experience, commitment, and eligibility to operate 
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and invited those three to submit quotations.    Page 3    B-423376 et al.   Nitaqat Mutawar Program ” and meet the corresponding requirements 
of the national social insurance program.   
 
RFQ at 16- 20, 46.   
The RFQ also expressly advised vendors that they could “ provide any other information 
considered relevant to the solicitation and PWS tasks .”  Id. at 46.   
 Under the past performance factor, the RFQ directed vendors to submit three past performance references with the same or similar scope and magnitude that would be evaluated to assess “ how capable the [vendor] is of successfully accomplishing the 
requirements of the solicitation. ”  Id. at 46- 47.  
 For the cost factor, which is not at issue here, the RFQ directed vendors to submit target costs and target fees using a web form, and documentation substantiating the 
realism of the vendor ’s direct labor rates  and indirect rates .  Id. at 48 -49.  
 The three quotations the Navy received were from Salient
3, Kratos , and a third firm that 
is not at issue here.  A technical evaluation board (TEB) reviewed the quotations , 
identified strengths and weaknesses in each vendor ’s proposed approach under the 
performance approach factor, and assessed adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, 
acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  AR, Tab 4, TEB Memorandum4 at 5.  The TEB 
also evaluated each vendor ’s past performance to assess first the relevance of each 
reference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant, and then all 
references together in aggregate.  The TEB then assess ed each vendor ’s record of 
performance under its relevant contracts , which was expressed in terms of a level of 
confidence in the vendor performing successfully .  The past performance evaluation 
resulted in adjectival ratings that included substantial confidence, satisfactory 
confidence, and limited confidence.  Id. at 5-6.   
 
The Navy identified two weaknesses in the Kratos ’s approach under the performance 
approach factor.  The first weakness concerned Kratos ’s approach to managing teams 
of personnel under PWS section 1.1.2 that included having the firm ’s managers 
communicate with RSNF leadership about academic schedules and requirements 
without including NETSAFA.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  6-7.  The s econd weakness 
concerned the firm’ s approach to supporting curriculum management under PWS 
sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 by proposi ng the use of Kratos ’s proprietary software, 
referred to as [DELETED] , rather than commercial ly available software .  The TEB 
explained that the use of proprietary software created a risk of vendor lock -in, a 
situation where RSNF curriculum management would become reliant on the proprietary 
 
3 Salient is the corporate parent of the incumbent contractor , Salient Federal SGIS.    
4 The TEB produced both a report document ing the evaluation judgments, and a 
memorandum to the contracting officer, which described the evaluation process and summarized the results.    Page 4    B-423376 et al.   software and would complicate efforts to achieve future competition for the requirement.  
Id. at 9.  Although the TEB also identified strengths in Kratos ’s approach regarding the 
same PWS requirements,  it determined the quotation merited an overall rating of 
acceptable under the performance approach factor.  Id.  at 12-13.   
In contrast, the TEB ’s evaluation of Salient ’s quotation found the firm ’s approach 
showed exceptional understanding and demonstrated the ability to exceed program 
requirements.  Id. at 19 -21.  The evaluation identified multiple strengths and no 
weaknesses, which the TEB determined merited an overall rating of outstanding under 
the performance approach factor .  Id. at 29-30.  
 In evaluating Kratos under the past performance factor, the Navy determined that two of 
the firm’ s past performance examples were very relevant, and one was somewhat 
relevant, and that  when considered in aggregate, they were very relevant.  AR, Tab 3, 
TEB Report at 15- 16.  The evaluators reviewed the assessments received from a point 
of contact for each relevant contract along with past performance database ratings.  Those reports were uniformly positive for Kratos and thus provided a high degree of confidence that Kratos would perform successfully.  The agency consequently assigned 
the quotation a rating of substantial confidence.  Id. at 17.  
 For Salient, the evaluators found one of its three past performance references was very relevant, while two were somewhat relevant.  Id.  at 30- 31.  Of those, the very relevant 
contract was the incumbent task order, which the evaluators described as being performed by “[t]he quoter . . . as the prime contractor .”  Id. at 29.  When considered i n 
aggregate, the evaluators viewed Salient ’s past performance as very relevant.  Id.  at 31.  
The record of past performance on the contracts identified in Salient ’s quotation was 
uniformly positive, and gave the evaluators a high degree of confidence that Salient would perform successfully and thus the agency assigned a rating of substantial 
confidence.  Id.  at 33.  
 The resulting adjectival ratings and evaluated costs  were as follows : 
 
 SALIENT  KRATOS  
PERFORMANCE APPROACH  OUTSTANDING  ACCEPTABLE  
PAST PERFORMANCE  SUBSTANTIAL 
CONFIDENCE  SUBSTANTIAL 
CONFIDENCE  
EVALUATED COST  $156,908,158.44  $145,320,893.56  
 AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 30.    
The contracting officer, who served as the source selection authority, reviewed and agreed with the evaluation report.  The contracting officer summarized the strengths in both firms ’ quotations, as well as the two weaknesses in Kratos ’s quotation under the 
performance approach factor and summarized the basis for both firm ’s past 
performance ratings.  AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 10- 12.  The 
contracting officer then made a comparative analysis  of the benefits of Salient ’s  Page 5    B-423376 et al.   approach and contrasted them with the evaluation of Kratos ’s quotation as generally 
adequate and providing strengths that were offset by its weaknesses.  Id. at 30-31.  The 
contracting officer then summarized the past performance of both and concluded that 
both firms merited a rating of substantial confidence.  Id.  at 32- 33.   
 Finally,  the contracting officer set out the source selection judgment that Salient ’s 
quotation demonstrated significant superiority over Kratos ’s under the performance 
approach factor, and a slight advantage under the past performance factor because its 
longer period of very relevant performance.  Id. at 33.  The contracting officer explained 
that Salient ’s advantage justified incurring the 8 percent higher evaluated cost, and 
therefore Salient ’s quotation represented the best value for the government , particularly 
in view of the importance of the work to the security cooperation between the Navy and RSNF .  Id. at 34.  After receiving notice of the source selection and a brief explanation 
of the selection decision, Kratos filed this protest.
5   
DISCUSSION  Kratos challenges the evaluation of both firms ’ quotations under the performance 
approach and past performance factors as unreasonable, argues that the Navy 
disparately  evaluat ed quotations , and contends that the source selection tradeoff 
decision was unreasonable.  We consider the protester ’s arguments in turn and find that 
the record does not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   
 
Performance Approach Evaluation  
 
Kratos argues that its quotation was misevaluated under the performance approach 
factor by the assessment of the two weaknesses and by the Navy ’s failure to recognize 
additional strengths in its proposed approach.  T he firm also argues that the evaluation 
reflects disparate treatment because the Navy assessed strengths for aspects of 
Salient ’s approach that both quotations had in common but failed to assess Kratos ’s 
quotation similarly.   
 
Where a protester challenges an agency ’s evaluation of quotations  in a task or delivery 
order competition under FAR subpart 16.5, our Office does not reevaluate quotations; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the evaluation criteria and the applicable procurement laws and 
regulations.  Wyle Labs., Inc. , B-416528.2, Jan. 11, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 19 at 4.  The 
evaluation of risk associated with specific aspects of  a vendor ’s proposed approach is 
proper even where risk may not have been specifically identified as an element of the 
evaluation.   Id. at 6.  Ultimately, a vendor  bears the obligation to submit a well -written 
quotation to clearly demonstrate its approach and its compliance with the solicitation 
requirements.   Manutek Inc. , B-422096, B -422096.2, Jan. 5, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 22 at  8.   
 
5 Our Office is authorized to hear protests of task orders that are issued under multiple-
award IDIQ contracts established within defense agencies where, as here,  the task 
order is valued in excess of $3 5 million.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1).   Page 6    B-423376 et al.   Evaluation of Weaknesses  
 
Kratos argues that the Navy misevaluated its  quotation by assessing a  weakness for 
posing a risk that Kratos would commit to work beyond the task order scope or agree to 
unauthorized commitments .  Protest at 8 -9.  In this regard, under the evaluation for 
PWS section 1.1.2, which addressed the vendor ’s management  of its teams ( often 
referred to in the record simply as program management) , the Navy assessed a 
weakness because Kratos ’s quotation described having the firm ’s managers 
communicate with RSNF  personnel to determine program requirements .  By proposing 
contact directly with RSNF  and without involv ement of NETSAFA  to establish those 
requirements , the evaluators found Kratos ’s approach posed  a risk of the firm 
performing requirements that exceed those required by the task order .  AR, Tab 3, TEB 
Report at 7.  The agency  deemed that aspect of the quotation a risk that constituted a 
weakness in the firm’s approach.   Id.  
 Kratos contends that the assessment of this weakness was unreasonable because the Navy  misread the approach described in the firm ’s quotation.  Protest at 8.  Kratos 
argues that when the quotation indicated direct contact with RSNF, the broader approach the firm proposed placed communication with the Navy first, and never 
indicated that the firm would fail to involve the Navy or that the firm would take direction 
from RSNF.  Id.  Instead, Kratos emphasizes that its quotation stated that the firm would 
[DELETED ].”  Id. (quoting Kratos Quotation vol. I at 4
6).  Further , Kratos argues that its 
quotation “[DELETED] ,” thereby committing to replicate its “ successful communication 
plan . . . during [its] last contract, ”7 whereas the evaluation was based only on an out -of-
context reading of one sentence.  Id. at 6; Comments & Supp. Protest at 6 ; Second 
Supp. Comments at 2 .   
The Navy responds that the evaluation of this  weakness was based on the description 
of the firm’ s approach in its quotation and was reasonable.  In particular, t he agency 
notes that the approach stated that Kratos ’s approach was to have its functional 
managers communicat e with RSNF about requirements and then, only afterward , seek  
final approval from NETSAFA.  Contrary to Kratos ’s assertion that the evaluators 
misread the quotation, the agency argues that the “ non-cost/technical quote, made no 
mention of NETSAFA ’s involvement in its planned communications with RSNF 
leadership. ”  Contracting Officer ’s Statement  and Memorandum of Law ( COS/ MOL ) 
at 18.  Therefore, the agency contends, it was reasonable for  the e valuators to conclude 
that Kratos ’s approach would risk leaving NETSAFA out of a discussion with RSNF 
leadership, which posed the risk of making commitments to RSNF that expanded the 
scope of work , made unauthorized commitments, or disrupted the chain of command.   
AR, Tab 8, Decl. of Technical Evaluation Board Chair at 7.   To the extent that the 
 
6 Citation s to the vendors ’ quotations refer to documents filed as  Electronic Protest 
Docketing System No.  36 (agency response to additional documents request).   
7 Kratos had been the incumbent contractor until 2021.    Page 7    B-423376 et al.   protester argues that its approach  was misunderstood, the agency counters that the 
language of the quotation was at best unclear.  Second Supp. MOL at  7.   
 
The record reasonably supports the Navy ’s evaluation.  The Kratos quotation describes 
what the agency understood as distinct elements  because they were set forth in 
separate sentences .  Among them was that the firm’ s functional managers would 
“[DELETED] ”  Kratos Quotation vol. I at 3.  NETSAFA is not mentioned in this sentence.  
The quotation stated the firm would then [ DELETED] .”  Id. at 4.  The Navy ’s conclusion 
that Kratos ’s approach posed a risk of developing a work plan that included 
commitments that NETSAFA had not authorized, work that was outside the scope of the contract, and disruption in the relationship between the Navy and RSNF was reasonable and based on the content of Kratos ’s quotation.   As noted above, Kratos 
had the responsibility to submit a clear and well -written quotation.  Manutek Inc. , supra.   
The record thus supports the Navy ’s evaluation judgment in assessing a weakness in 
Kratos ’s quotation.
8  While the evaluation characterized the weakness as being offset 
by the firm ’s general emphasis on open communication with NETSAFA, the net effect 
still contributed to the overall assessment of Kratos ’s quotation as acceptable under the 
performance approach factor.  COS/ MOL at 17.  Consequently, the evaluators and, 
subsequently, the contracting officer , properly consider ed the weakness in their overall 
assessment of the merit of Kratos ’s quotation under the performance approach factor.   
 Kratos next argues that the assessment of the second weakness under the 
performance approach factor was unreasonable.  As noted above, the TEB assessed a weakness based on the quotation describing the use of Kratos ’s proprietary software in 
 
8 Kratos also argues that the evaluation reflects disparate treatment because Salient ’s 
quotation was not assessed a weakness even though it also allegedly proposed communication with RSNF that did not include NETSAFA , and because Kratos ’s 
quotation was not assessed a strength, as Salient ’s was, for its substantively 
indistinguishable communications plan.  Second Supp. Protest at 3-5.  Where a 
protester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the offerors ’ proposals  (or 
quotations) .  Paragon Sys., Inc.; S ecTek, Inc. , B-409066.2, B -409066.3, June 4, 2014, 
2014 CPD ¶ 169 at 8- 9.   
The record supports the Navy ’s explanation that even though each quotation had “ a 
similar overall concept of coordinated and frequent communication, ” Salient ’s was more 
detailed and beneficial.  Second Supp. Decl. of TEB Chair at 3.  For example, Salient ’s 
approach clearly emphasized its use of steady informal communication to keep 
NETSAFA updated about its operations, while Kratos ’s relied on standard formal 
updates to the agency.  Id.  Given what the Navy  notes is added complexity of operating 
across geographically dispersed sites  and interacting with RSNF, the agency explains 
that it viewed Salient ’s approach as providing better visibility into the contractor ’s 
performance that provided an important advantage over Kratos ’s formal communication 
structure.  Id.  Given the differences in the approaches, Kratos has not shown that the 
evaluation reflected disparate treatment.    Page 8    B-423376 et al.   support of the curriculum management requirements , which were required under 
sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 of the PWS .  The evaluators deemed the approach a 
weakness because it would foster reliance on Kratos ’s proprietary software systems 
that would then complicate efforts to recompete the requirement .  Kratos argues that the 
Navy again misread the firm ’s quotation, which it argues only described the planned use 
of its proprietary software as part of an effort that supports [ DELETED] , separate from 
the perf ormance of the contract at issue.  Protest at 9- 12; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 8-9.   
 
Kratos argues  that its quotation only mentioned the proprietary software to explain the 
firm’s involvement with [ DELETED]  as a basis to recommend that NETSAFA work with 
[DELETED ] to gain the benefit of its training opportunities and access to its [DELETED] .  
Kratos argues that its quotation did not propose to implement its proprietary software in the performance of the task order at issue, so assessing a weakness for that approach 
was baseless and thus unreasonable.  Id.   Further, Kratos argues that even if the Navy 
was reasonable to read the quotation as proposing the use of the proprietary software on the task order at issue, it was still unreasonable to assess a weakness because Kratos was at most recommending that  the agency use its proprietary software, and that 
NETSAFA could simpl y decline to adopt that recommendation.  Comments & Supp. 
Protest at  6.   
 The Navy argues that its evaluation was reasonable.  The agency contends  that the 
language of Kratos ’s quotation specifically recommends the use of its [ DELETED]  
proprietary software in its performance approach narrative responding to PWS sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3.  COS/ MOL at 19.   That is, the firm did not simply mention its 
proprietary software, but specifically recommended its use as its performance approach under the curriculum management tasks.  Id.  The agency contends that its reading of 
the quotation was reasonable, and its concern about adopting Kratos ’s proposed 
approach to curriculum management as effectively locking in Kratos ( through 
institutionalizing the use of its proprietary software)  is reasonable and supports the 
assessment of the weakness .  Id. at 20 (citing AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at 7 -8). 
 Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evalua tion.  In its 
quotation, the passage at issue appears  to state that Kratos ’s approach to the task 
order at issue involves the use of its propriet ary software:   
 
[DELETED ]. 
 Kratos Quotation vol. I at 6.   
 An agency may reasonably consider the risks of an approach to performance that relies on proprietary software in its evaluation.  Comprehensive Health Servs., Inc. , 
B-292858.3 et al. , April 27, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶  165 at 6 -7 (agency reasonably 
downgraded protester ’s proposal based on concern that the proposed implementa tion 
and use of proprietary software “pose [d] obvious risks with regard to, among other 
things, a successor contract ”).  Here, the Navy  understood Kratos ’s approach to the  Page 9    B-423376 et al.   task order at issue as making a recommendation for aligning the curriculum 
development for RSNF with the resources and capabilities at [ DELETED] , which Kratos 
described as including its proprietary software system  as key intellectual property .  
Kratos Quotation vol. I at 6.  As a result, t he Navy  was reasonable in assessing a 
weakness based on an approach that recommended the use of Kratos ’s proprietary 
software solution.9   
Failure to Assign Strengths  
 Kratos next argues that the Navy misevaluated multiple aspects of its quotation that 
should have resulted in the assessment of additional strengths  under the performance 
approach factor .   
 Where an evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria, the protester ’s assertion that its proposal  (or quotation, as here) should have been 
assessed additional strengths under a factor does not demonstrate an unreasonable evaluation;  rather, the protester ’s arguments simply constitute disagreement with the 
agency ’s evaluation judgments  that do not provide a basis to sustain the protest .  
GeoNorth LLC , B-411473 et al. , Aug. 6, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 247 at 7.  As described 
below, the evaluation record documents careful review of the protester ’s proposed 
approach to the curriculum management and local employment plan requirements and considered judgment that the aspects that Kratos contends should have been additional strengths were not valuable to the Navy and thus did not merit additional strengths.  The protester ’s arguments to the contrary do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   
Kratos argues that its ongoing role as the RSNF training systems support contractor  
uniquely allowed it to leverage the abilities of Kratos ’s subject matter experts who are 
involved in providing integration work for the Naval Tactical Team Trainer (NTTT)  and 
other new systems, and that Kratos could further provide the benefits of graphics and simulation content  created using the NTTT system if the Navy were to develop or 
update interactive media resources under the task order at issue.  Kratos argues that 
the Navy unreasonabl y failed to assess an additional strength for proposing those 
benefits.  Protest at 12- 13; Comments & Supp. Protest at 12 .  
 The Navy argues that the evaluation reasonably determined that Kratos ’s quotation did 
not merit assessment of an additional strength with respect to Kratos ’s role as the 
 
9 Although Kratos contends that Salient likewise proposed to rely on proprietary 
software solutions , for which it disparately received a strength,  the record does not 
support this contention.  The Navy counters that the strength assessed for Salient ’s 
software systems, identified as “[DELETED]” and “[DELETED] ,” are both commercially 
available programs sold by third parties, which therefore present  no similar risk of 
vendor lock -in because licenses to both systems could be transferred to,  or be acquired 
by, a successor contractor through ordinary commercial means .  Second Supp. Decl. of 
TEB Chair at  4-5.  The record thus does not provide a basis to find that the evaluation 
involved disparate treatment here.    Page 10    B-423376 et al.   RSNF training systems support contractor .  Regarding the firm’ s proposed approach of 
leveraging that effort to provide expertise, graphics, and simulations, the agency 
counters that the evaluators reasonabl y found the requirements of this task order would 
not benefit from the types of expertise, or the graphics and simulations , that are  
produced by NTTT or other systems  under the training systems support work .  Further , 
the agency notes that even if there were potential crossover benefits from the RSNF 
training systems support contract, the advantages  would once again raise risks of 
creating dependencies to Kratos proprietary software systems , and NTTT specifically , 
so the risk of vendor lock -in would have been a weakness rather than a strength.  
COS/ MOL at 21.   
 Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation 
judgment.  The record shows that the evaluators  specifically considered the firm ’s ability 
to leverage ownership of the NTTT software, and made a judgment that it was not considered a benefit at least in part because the scope of the task order at issue did not 
include use of simulation training.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.  Kratos supports its 
claim that the ownership of the NTTT software would benefit the Navy by arguing that it 
would make the firm ’s efforts more efficient, such as if Kratos were to prepare 
interactive multimedia under PWS sections 2.1.1.6 or 2.1.4.  Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 10.  Kratos ’s argument does not demonstrate that the evaluation under the RFQ 
criteria was unreasonable, however,  particularly because those PWS tasks were not 
among the five that the RFQ identified as being evaluated under the performance approach factor.  See RFQ at  46.  Rather, the record supports the reasonableness of 
the agency ’s judgment because the evaluators considered the potential benefit of 
Kratos ’s software and found the NTTT software (including its ownership by Kratos ) 
would not provide significant value to the agency under the evaluation criteria for this 
task order.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.   
 Kratos also argues that its quotation should also have been assessed a strength under 
the evaluation element for section 5 of the PWS,  regarding a plan to meet local 
requirements to employ Saudi nationals , because the firm had platinum status in the 
Nitaqat Mutawar program , which requires employment of Saudi nationals .  Kratos 
argues that its rating exceeded the RFQ requirement that the vendor had to maintain a minimum of a “ [m]edium [g]reen”  rating.  P rotest at 13.  The firm argues that the Navy 
unreasonably overlooked a significant benefit of  its higher platinum rating because 
attaining it made it less likely that through loss of qualifying employees, Kratos would be 
downgraded below medium green.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at 10- 11.  The firm  
also argues that the Navy improperly treated the requirement as pass/fail, rather than 
recognizing the advantage of Kratos ’s platinum status under the program, which would 
have justified the assessment of a strength based on the lower risk that Kratos would be downgraded below the PWS requirement of medium green.  Id.  at 10.    
 The Navy argues that the evaluation was reasonable because the RFQ required an 
approach to maint ain a minimum rating of “[m]edium [g]reen”  and comply with the social 
insurance program.  The agency contends that whether a vendor ’s approach ensured 
the firm would attain a medium green rating,  or would attain a higher rating,  the  Page 11    B-423376 et al.   approach provided equal value because platinum status provided no additional benefits  
to the Navy.  AR, Tab 8, Decl. of TEB Chair at 9; COS/ MOL at 22.  T he Navy also 
argues that the evaluators properly considered Kratos ’s four-element plan regarding 
PWS section 5, of which one element was for the firm to exceed only slightly the 
minimum local employment required to maintain medium green status for the task order 
at issue (i.e., the firm clarified that it would achieve a Saudization rate of [DELETED] 
percent on the task order, thereby exceeding the medium green requirement of 
38.81 percent).  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 12.  The Navy  also considered other 
elements of the firm’ s approach that addressed successful recruiting and monitoring of 
employment and payroll compliance.  Id.  at 12-13.  In considering the plan as a whole, 
the evaluators reasonably deemed it adequate based on the firm ’s focus on candidate 
recruitment and monitoring compliance.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 13.   
 Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation here.  
Kratos ’s quotation states that the firm “currently hold[s] Platinum status ” in the Nitaqat 
Mutawar program, and then describes its proposed approach to the requirements of 
section 5 of the PWS as including a goal to maintain sufficient qualifying employees to 
attain medium green status.  Kratos Quotation vol. I at  10.  The Navy has explained why 
platinum status did not afford any additional benefit to the agency and, in our view, the evaluators reasonably  determined that a strength was not justified.    
 Even if the Navy improperly assess ed vendors ’ Nitaqat Mutawar program status b y 
treating the offerors ’ proposed approaches  as a pass/fail evaluation, the record shows 
that Kratos was not prejudiced by that  evaluation.   Our Office will not sustain a protest 
unless the protester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the 
agency ’s actions, that is, unless the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency ’s 
actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  McDon ald-Bradley , B-270126, Feb. 8, 1996, 96- 1 CPD ¶ 54 at 3.   The record does not 
support Kratos ’s claim that its quotation exceeded the minimum standard in the RFQ ; 
rather, while it presently has platinum status, its proposed approach is to attain medium green status .  As a result, even if the agency had rated vendors higher for proposing an 
approach that surpassed the requirement to maintain medium green status, Kratos has not shown that its approach did so and could reasonably have been rated higher than acceptable.   The protester has thus failed to show that the Navy evaluation was 
unreasonable when it assessed Kratos ’s proposed approach, which set a goal of 
qualifying for medium green status under the task order at issue.  The record does not show that Kratos ’s approach provided additional value to the agency.   
 Past Performance Evaluation  
 Kratos challenges the evaluation of Salient ’s past performance, arguing that the Navy 
improperly credited Salient with the past performance of its affiliates , specifically past 
performance by Salient ’s corporate parent and by the incumbent contractor , Salient 
Federal SGIS, which is Salient ’s subsidiary.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  Kratos 
argues that the record does not reflect any recognition by the Navy that the past  Page 12    B-423376 et al.   performance was for affiliated companies or that it was properly considered in 
assessing Salient ’s past performance.  Id.   
 
The Navy responds that the past performance evaluation was reasonable and properly considered the past performance of Salient ’s affiliates because the agency understood 
that Salient was fully involved in performance of the incumbent contract, and the 
quotation described specific resources that Salient would use to perform as being the 
same that were performing the incumbent contract.  Supp. COS at 2.   The agency also 
argues  that Salient and its affiliates are operationally united, and the resources of both 
affiliates were committed to performance of the task order at issue here.  Supp. MOL at 10-11.  The TEB chair confirms that even though the past performance evaluation 
record did not expressly explain the circumstances , the panel was aware that Salient ’s 
affiliate was the awardee of the incumbent contract, and that Salient ’s quotation 
reflected continued use of the incumbent ’s resources, including Salient committing  to 
continue all incumbent employees at their current salaries .  More generally , the 
evaluators were aware that Salient and its corporate affiliates (its parent and its subsidiary) were closely aligned through shared personnel and resources  and were 
effectively performing as one entity under the umbrella of Salient ’s parent .  Supp. AR, 
Second Decl. of TEB Chair at 2- 3; Supp. COS at  2-4.  The Navy argues that the 
agency’s past performance evaluation properly considered performance of the affiliates 
in evaluating Salient under the past performance factor based on the recognition of the close connection between the affiliated entities.   
The evaluation of past performance is a matter of discretion which our Office will not 
disturb unless the agency ’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the 
solicitation criteria .  In a protest  challenging the evaluation of past performance, our 
Office will review the record to determine if the evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the solicitation ’s evaluation criteria and procurement law and 
regulations .  Computer Scis. Corp. , B-409386.2, B -409386.3, Jan. 8, 2015, 2015 CPD 
¶ 34 at 12.  An agency properly may attribute the past performance of a parent or 
affiliated company to an offeror where the firm ’s proposal (or quotation) demonstrates 
that the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  
Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 92 at 14.   
 
Our review of the record shows that  the Navy justifi ed including in the evaluation of 
Salient ’s past performance contracts awarded to its parent and its subsidiary  because 
the agency reasonably viewed the three firms as operationally united and identified 
resources of the incumbent that were committed to performance of the task order at issue .  The agency recognized a significant connection through three elements 
identified in the quotation:  continued use of a training facility from the incumbent contract , a facility it had established in Saudi Arabia, and a corporate leadership cell .  
Salient Quotation vol. I at 3- 4.  The quotation also described Salient as successfully 
performing the incumbent contract and portrayed the three firms as operationally 
unified.  Id.  at 3.  The quotation named the key incumbent leadership personnel as 
continuing in their respective positions and explained its staffing for other positions as retaining many named incumbent employees , who would keep their employment 
certification status and current salaries  for the base year of the task order at issue.  Id.   Page 13    B-423376 et al.   at 4; Salient Cost Quotation at 8- 9.  Finally, Salient and its affiliates share the same 
corporate address and are listed as being affiliated in their SAM.gov records.  Supp. 
MOL at 2.   
 The TEB chair reasonably explains that the evaluators recognized  the description in the 
quotation as consistent with the firms ’ unified management under the umbrella of the 
parent company , and that the quotation indicated that the unified resources of the firms 
would perform the task order at issue.   Supp. AR , Second Decl. of TEB Chair at 1, 3.   In 
our view, the circumstances provide a sufficient basis for the Navy evaluators to consider the performance of both Salient ’s parent and its subsidiary in the pas t 
performance evaluation.   
 Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Finally, Kratos challenges the Navy ’s tradeoff rationale in selecting Salient ’s higher -
rated and higher -priced quotation for award.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 11.  In its 
initial protest and comments, Kratos contended that the source selection rationale relie d 
improperly on adjectival ratings and the number of strengths and weaknesses assessed in the evaluation, rather than on the underlying merits of the quotations, to justify incurring $11.6 million of additional evaluated costs in selecting Salient ’s quotation.  Id.  
at 12 n.4.   
 However, after Kratos filed its comments, the Navy submitted additional relevant documents, which included an unredacted copy of its business clearance memorandum , and those provided previously -redacted portions of the contracting 
officer ’s source selection rationale.  In response, Kratos re focused its challenge to the 
best-value tradeoff:  In its second supplemental comments, Kratos argues that the 
source selection decision was flawed because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable evaluation and unequal treatment of both quotations.  A s explained 
above, our review of the record shows that the Navy ’s evaluations under the 
performance approach and past performance factors were  reasonable and that the 
allegedly unequal evaluation was justified by material differences in the quotations.   In 
sum, the allegation lacks a factual basis because the evaluation it was based on was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Accordingly, Kratos’s challenge to the 
best-value tradeoff is denied.   
 The protest is denied.    Edda Emmanuelli Perez

DECISION  
 Owl International Inc ., doing business as  Global, a 1st Flagship Company , of Irvine, 
California, protests the award of a contract to PCCI, Inc ., of Alexandria, Virginia, under 
request for proposals (RFP) No. N00024- 23-R-4304, issued by the Department of the 
Navy , Naval Sea Systems Command, for services to manage, operate, and maintain 
the emergency ship salvage material (ESSM) system and support the Navy ’s oil and DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.

contends that the Navy misevaluated both firms ’ proposals and made an unreasonable 
source selection decision.   
 
We sustain the protest  in part and deny it in part .   
 BACKGROUND  
 The Navy issued the RFP on September 28, 2023, to obtain proposals to provide 
services under an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract for five years, 
with a maximum value of $315 million.   Agency Report ( AR), Tab 2 , Consolidated RFP 
at 1-3.  Offeror s were directed to price services on a cost -plus-award- fee basis for 
operational efforts, and on a cost -plus-fixed -fee basis for nonoperational efforts .  Id. 
at 2.  The RFP included a statement of work  (SOW) that described the general scope of 
the contract as providing engineering and technical services to support the ESSM system, provide operational and nonoperational support to the Navy ’s oil and hazardous 
substance spill response program.  Additionally, the contractor would provide equipment operation, maintenance, and related support at remote sites for a range of operations.   
Id. at 15. 
 The RFP instructed offerors to submit proposals in three volumes:  t echnical (volume I), 
cost/price (volume II), and solicitation package (volume III) .  Id. at 72 .  The RFP 
anticipated the award of a single IDIQ contract to the offeror whose proposal was 
evaluated as offering the best value to the government .  The evaluation of proposals 
would utilize three factors, listed in descending order of importance:  t echnical 
capability , past performance, and c ost/price.  Id. at 10 9.  When combined, t he technical 
capability and past performance factors were significantly more important than cost/price  in determining which proposal provided the best value; in other words , the 
RFP indicated that the source selection would be based on a tradeoff among the 
technical capability, past performance, and cost/price factors .  Id.   
 Under the technical factor, t he RFP instructed offerors to address three elements in 
their technical proposals :  personnel; management
1; and technical capability and 
experience .  Id. at 74 -80.  Additionally, the RFP identified  a fourth technical element, a 
sample problem, and stated that it would be optional for the agency  to require .2  Id. 
at 80.  The evaluation of each element was described as follows:    
 
1 In the record, the management element is also referred to as the management 
approach/organization plan element .  E.g., AR, Tab 1, Contracting Officer ’s 
Statement  (COS) at  2.   
2 Ultimately, after receiving proposals, the Navy  issue d a sample problem .  A challenge 
to the evaluation of PCCI’s sample problem was among several issues that our Office 
indicated would likely be dismissed, but the protester subsequently withdrew  it.    Page 3   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The evaluation standard is:  
• Element A:  Personnel .  The degree to which the proposal 
demonstrates that the Offeror is capable of providing personnel 
with the professional and technical skills to successfully perform the 
requirements of the [statement of work] . 
• Element B:  Management .  The degree to which the proposal 
demonstrates that the Offeror ’s management 
approach/organization plan is adequate to accomplish program objectives and satisfy all aspects of the [statement of work] and ESSM mission requirements based on the ESSM Operations Guide.   
• Element C:  Technical Capability and Experience.   The degree to 
which the proposal demonstrates that the Offeror has the 
necessary technical capability and corporate experience related to 
storage, maintenance and operation of ESSM -type facilities, 
equipment, and systems .  
• Element D:  Sample Problem .  The degree to which the response to 
the sample problem .  . . demonstrates the Offeror ’s understanding 
of the Government ’s requirements and the ability to adequately and 
realistically solve a problem in a condensed period of time .   
 
Id. at 109- 110.   
 Within the technical capability evaluation,  proposals were to be evaluated under each of 
the four elements  described above, but the RFP expressly stated the elements were not 
considered subfactors and would not be separately rated.   Id.  The RFP also listed 
subject areas within elements that offerors were instructed to address ; for example, key 
personnel resumes under the personnel element, and nine areas under the management approach/organization plan element,  such as overall organizational 
structure , staffing levels , and training .  Id. at 75- 79.  The RFP also stated that the 
technical capability evaluation would result in assessment of combined technical/risk ratings using color and adjectival rating pairs:  blue/outstanding, purple/good, 
green/acceptable, yellow/marginal, or red/unacceptable.   Id. at 110.   
 Under the past performance factor, the RFP indicated that the agency would evaluate the recency, relevance, and quality of the offeror ’s performance record.   Id. at 111.
3  
The evaluation would then rate each performance reference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant.  Id.   Then, taking into account  the relevance of the 
references and the record of performance, the offeror ’s overall past performance would 
be assessed a confidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, unknown (or neutral), limited, or no confidence.  Id.  at 112.

Adobe PDF file submitted to our Office, we cite the PDF page numbering.    Page 4   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The cost/price evaluation would be based on a total evaluated cost/price, using cost 
information provided by the offeror, principally scheduled labor rates, indirect rates, and 
the offeror ’s award fee/fixed fee.  Id.   Additionally, the RFP directed offerors to complete 
an accompanying cost worksheet by providing standard and overtime labor rates, and percentages for the firm ’s proposed fringe benefit rate, overhead rate, and general and 
administrative rate.  AR, Tab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2.  For scheduled labor r ates, the 
RFP explained that offerors were to propose burdened rates , excluding fee amounts, 
and therefore the Navy would “ only evaluate the proposed scheduled labor rates for 
reasonableness and material balance. ”  Id. at 113.  Additionally, the RFP incorporated 
FAR provision 52.222- 46, which provides for an assessment of the compensation of 
professional employees.  Id. at 90.   
 For indirect rates, the RFP specified different evaluation methods depending on whether the offeror proposed to cap its indirect rates:   
If the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost-realism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the 
proposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.  If proposed indirect rates are 
considered to be unrealistic, the Offeror ’s proposed rates will  be adjusted 
upward to determine the Government evaluated indirect rate.  No 
downward adjustment will be made. . . .  
If the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate 
represents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic.  
 Id. at 113.   
 Finally, the RFP provided that for purposes of evaluation, the offeror ’s proposed award-
fee and fixed- fee “evaluated fee percentages will be equal to the proposed fee 
percentages. ”  Id.   
 
After an initial evaluation, the Navy held discussions with both offerors and requested 
final proposal revisions.  The evaluation of final proposal revisions identified strengths and weaknesses in both firms ’ proposals  under the technical capability factor .  The 
agency then determined that in comparing the firms ’ evaluations, some strengths and 
weaknesses were offset by strengths or weaknesses of similar significance in the competing proposal, and thus were considered offsetting.  Other strengths and weaknesses were determined not to have offsetting aspects in the competitor ’s 
proposal, and thus provided aspects with which to discriminate between the two proposals.  AR, Tab 6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at 8- 16.  For 
the past performance factor, the agency determined that both offerors had demonstrated performance records that were similar in relevance and quality, and that no aspect of the past performance evaluation provided a basis to distinguish between the com petitors.  Id. at 17.    Page 5   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 In addition to those discriminating strengths and weaknesses, the overall evaluation 
produced the following ratings and total evaluated cost/prices:

 AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 7, 24; AR, Tab 6 , 
SSAC Report at 4; AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 3.    
The SSAC advised that its review determined that PCCI ’s proposal was superior to an 
extent that justified paying its higher total evaluated cost/price, which represented a cost premium of 5 percent.   AR, Tab 6, SSAC Report at 18 -19.  The source selection 
authority ( SSA) then reviewed the evaluation and tradeoff recommendation and 
concurred with them .  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  2.  The SSA then explained that based on 
independent judgment, PCCI ’s proposal represented the best value considering its 
superior technical evaluation, and cost/price premium of 5 percent.  Based on that judgment, the SSA selected PCCI for award.  Id.  at 3.  Following notice of the award 
and a debriefing, Owl filed this protest.   
 DISCUSSION  Owl challenges multiple aspects of the evaluation and source selection decision.   We 
first turn to the protester ’s argument that PCCI was not a responsible contractor, which 
we dismiss as lacking a sufficient factual basis.  We next determine that Owl ’s challenge 
to the Navy ’s failure to perform an evaluation of the offerors ’ professional compensation 
is valid and we sustain the protest on that basis .  We then address the protester ’s 
remaining challenges to the evaluation of proposals, which we conclude are without 
merit.    
 Challenge to Affirmative Responsibility Determination  
 Owl’s protest contends that PCCI lacked the financial capacity to perform the contract, 
and that the Navy ignored information regarding that lack of financial capacity that should have caused the Navy to find the firm not responsible to perform the contract.  Protest at 66.  In this regard, Owl asserts that PCCI proposed to cap its indirect costs below their documented historical rates and contends that PCCI also lacks adequate sources of financing that it will need to perform.  Id.   In Owl ’s view, the circ umstances 
indicate that PCCI has less than a half million dollars in working capital, but its capped indirect costs put it at risk of financial losses that Owl argues could exceed $26 million.  Id.; see also Opp. to Req. for Dismissal at 9.  In sum, Owl argues, the lack of access to 
capital to manage losses resulting from the firm ’s proposed indirect cost cap was  Page 6   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 material information that the Navy failed to adequately consider, which should have 
resulted in the Navy finding PCCI was not a responsible offeror to perform this contract.   
 The Navy argues that Owl ’s challenge to the affirmative responsibility determination of 
PCCI is not an aspect of responsibility that GAO reviews and should therefore be dismissed.  The RFP requirement that the contractor possess financial capability does not establish a specific objective standard that could constitute definitive responsibility criteria, the agency contends.  Req. for Dismissal at 7.  Further, the Navy argues that Owl has not identified a violation of law or regulation, or any information that would “rais[e] serious concerns  that . . . the contracting officer unreasonably failed to consider 
available relevant information”  regarding PCCI ’s responsibility.  Id . at 6.  Rather, the 
agency maintains that the record shows the contracting officer exercised reasonable business judgment in finding that PCCI was a responsible contractor.   
Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. section 21.5(c), generally exclude from our 
review, consideration of protests that challenge an affirmative responsibility determination, with limited exceptions.  Those exceptions include that our Office will consider  a protest alleging that specific objective standards of responsibility were not 
met, and that an affirmative responsibility determination failed to adequately consider information that was known or reasonably should have been known that, by its nature, would be expected to have a strong bearing on whether the awardee should be found 
responsible.  4 C.F.R. § 21.5(c); MVM, Inc ., B-421788. 3, B-421788. 4, Mar. 5, 2024, 
2024 CPD ¶ 63 at 10.  Our decision in MVM  exemplifies the type of information that 
would meet our standard, where publicly available information indicated that the awardee ’s affiliate had settled false claims under a contract with a federal agency.  Id.  
The information at issue here, in contrast, questions PCCI ’s need for and access to 
working ca pital.  It does not rise to the level required by our regulations to support a 
challenge to the Navy ’s responsibility determination.  Instead, Owl ’s allegations raise 
ordinary issues of financial capacity for the Navy to resolve.  We therefore dismiss the challenge to the Navy ’s determination that PCCI is a responsible contractor.   
 Failure to Evaluate Professional Compensation 
 
Owl argues that the Navy failed to assess the realism of the offerors ’ professional 
compensation as required by the RFP, which incorporated Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) provision 52.222-46.  Protest at  72-73.  That provision provides that 
“[t]he professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact 
upon recruiting and retention,  its realism , and its consistency with a total plan for 
compensation. ”  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) .   
 The RFP instructed offerors to provide cost information in the proposal cost/price 
volume, including worksheet L- 2.  While the RFP instructions identified a requirement to 
provide scheduled labor rates, indirect costs, and fringe benefit costs , RFP at 113, it 
also instructed that all cells colored yellow in the worksheet were to be completed, which included a breakdown of the offeror ’s rates by location and performance period 
into fringe rates, overhead rates, and general and administrative rates.  Id. at 84; AR, 
Tab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2 at 6.  Thus, while t he scheduled labor rates were to be  Page 7   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 proposed as fully burdened (exclusive of fee)  fixed hourly rates , offerors were required 
to provide the applicable indirect burden percentages.   
 
The analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46 requires the agency to conduct “ in effect, a 
price realism evaluation regarding an offeror ’s proposed compensation, ” and the agency 
must also “ compare the awardee’ s proposed professional compensation to the 
incumbent ’s.”  Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, Jul.  31, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 259 at 5.    
The Navy and PCCI argue that this ground of protest should be dismissed because the statement that the evaluation of scheduled labor rates would only  consider 
reasonableness and balance was an obvious indication that the agency would not 
evaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52. 222-46, notwithstanding 
the inclusion of that provision in the RFP .  Req . for Dismissal at 8 -10 (arguing the RFP 
“statement excludes the possibility of price realism ”); Intervenor ’s Response to Req.  for 
Dismissal at  18.  Additionally , the Navy argues that the RFP also did not provide for the 
agency to obtain information needed to perform a comparison between the awardee’ s 
professional compensation and the incumbent ’s, thereby making it apparent on the face 
of the RFP that the Navy would not perform the second element of the analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Req. for Dismissal at 8 -9.  The Navy also argues that the 
RFP did not reference submission of a professional compensation plan in the proposal preparation instructions or evaluation criteria and did not request salary information or a 
description of fringe benefits provided to professional employees.  Id.  at 9.  Accordingly , 
the agency argues , the RFP instructions “ directly contradic t[ed]” the evaluation that 
would have been required under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Id.  at 8.   
 
We disagree.
4  The RFP statement limiting the evaluation of the scheduled labor rates 
(to an assessment of reasonableness and material balance) is not contradicted--directly or implicitly --by FAR provision 52.222- 46 since the evaluations consider different 
information.  Specifically, the scheduled labor rates are burdened rates  (what the 
contractor will charge the government,  albeit without fee)  whereas the evaluation under 
FAR provision 52.222- 46 assesses professional employee compens ation, which 
includes “salaries and fringe benefits .”  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a).  Further, although 
the Navy contends that it was apparent to offerors that proposals would not include 
sufficient information to make an analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46, the Navy’s 
position is not supported by the record.  W orksheet L- 2 required offerors to provide the 
Navy the means to calculate both the offeror ’s direct labor rate-- what the offeror will pay 
an employee--and expressly required it to provide fringe benefit rate(s)--the cost of the 
employee’s benefits relative to their wages .  We therefore conclude that the R FP 
provided that the Navy would evaluate professional compensation consistent with FAR provision 52.222- 46, and that the RFP also required offerors to provide at least some 
minimal amount of information necessary for  the Navy to perform an evaluation.  
 
4 Although our Office indicated that dismissal of this ground of protest as untimely 
appeared appropriate, we indicated that view was not a final decision,  and the parties 
could raise additional arguments pending resolution of the protest in th e decision.  
Notice of GAO Ruling on Partial Dismissal Request at 2.    Page 8   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 We have explained that t he purpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 (titled  Evaluation of 
Compensation for Professional Employees ), is to evaluate whether an offeror will obtain 
and keep the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract 
performance, and to evaluate whether it understands the nature of the work to be 
performed.  In the context of a contract where labor is priced by fixed  hourly rates , our 
Office has noted that this FAR provision anticipates an evaluation of whether the offeror 
understands the contract ’s requirements and has offered a compensation plan 
appropriate for those requirements , which requires assessing the offeror ’s proposed 
professional compensation.  The depth of the analysis is a matter of the procuring 
agency ’s judgment, and so, in reviewing a protest challenging the evaluation, we will 
assess whether the agency ’s evaluation was reasonabl e and consistent with the 
solicitation.   Criterion Sys ., Inc., B-419749 et al. , July  21, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  261 at 6- 7.   
 Here, t he Navy failed to assess the information provided in the offerors ’ proposals 
regarding professional compensation; it made no assess ment  of the realism of either 
offeror ’s professional compensation or whether it was lower than the incumbent ’s 
compensation of professionals.  Indeed, the agency emphatically asserts that there was “no doubt that the Navy would not obtain the information needed to evaluate the 
proposals in accordance with FAR 52.222- 46 and would not in fact conduct the 
evaluation. ”  See  Navy Req. for Dismissal at 8.   In res ponse to a question posed by Owl 
during its debriefing, the Navy stated that “The capability to recruit and/or retain personnel at proposed scheduled labor rates was not a specific requirement under Factor 3.0 [the cost/price factor]  and was therefore not evaluated for Volume II [the 
cost/price  proposal].”  Protest exhs. 21- 30, exh. 27, Responses to Owl Debriefing 
Questions at 73 (Answer No. 12).
5   
 The RFP included FAR provision 52.222- 46, which provided that the agency would 
assess professional compensation.  The RFP required offerors to provide sufficient information for the Navy to assess, at a minimum, the offeror ’s direct rate s and fringe 
benefit rates.  Because the Navy failed to perform the analysis required by FAR provision 52.222- 46, we sustain this ground of protest.   
Technical Evaluation Challenges  
 
Turning to the remaining allegations, Owl raises many challenges to the evaluation of 
both firms ’ proposals .  Owl argues that the technical evaluation was unreasonable in 
multiple respects within each element .  Broadly, Owl contends that the Navy failed to 
reasonably consider significant differences in the proposed approaches and the 
resulting performance risk of both offerors, the agency unreasonably undervalued Owl ’s 
retention of most incumbent staff , treated the offerors unequally , and it erroneously 
evaluated PCCI ’s experience based, at least in part, on misrepresentations .  The 
 
5 Since, as noted above, the depth of the evaluation is principally a matter for the 
agency to determine, the fact that the agency did not request or obtain detailed 
compensation plans from either offeror does not mitigate the failure to evaluate the inform ation that was submitted.    Page 9   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 protester also challenges the past performance evaluation as unreasonable and 
contends that the cost evaluation failed to assess the risk posed by PCCI ’s indirect cost 
rate caps .  We have reviewed all of Owl ’s additional arguments and conclude that none, 
with the exception of the agency’s failure to evaluate professional compensation discussed above, provides a basis to sustain the protest .  We discuss only the most 
significant allegations below.   
 Under element A, personnel, the protester argues that the Navy unreasonably failed to 
recognize that Owl ’s proposed approach provided significant advantages over PCCI ’s, 
and that the agency unreasonably discounted those advantages and mischaracterized 
Owl as having only a slight advantage.  Protest at 50- 51.  T he protester contends that 
its proposal provided significant unique value because it would retain [DELETED]  the 
incumbent key personnel ( [DELETED]  of 22 positions , of which nearly all made 
exclusive commitments to Owl ) and would also retain [ DELETED]  of the non- key 
personnel , while  PCCI ’s proposal  did not provide that the firm had commitments to 
retain most incumbent key personnel .  Id. at 51-52.  Owl argues that the Navy correctly 
characterized  this difference as representing a significant advantage to the agency, but 
the evaluators  then unreasonably discounted that  conclusion in the overall assessment 
under the personnel element.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-25.   
 Additionally, Owl argues that the Navy made multiple errors in evaluating PCCI ’s 
proposal.  For one, t he protester contends that the Navy unreasonably minimized the 
significance of PCCI proposing a program manager who lacked relevant on-site and 
field experience and who allegedly would not be committed fully to the ESSM program.  
Id. at 25- 27.  Further, Owl argues that the evaluation of PCCI also overlooked 
weaknesses that should have been assessed for proposing inexperienced personnel in multiple roles, (principally its [ DELETED] ).  Id. at 25-28.  More generally, Owl contends 
that the evaluation of PCCI ’s proposal under element A failed  to adequately consider 
risks arising from PCCI proposing to change over most key personnel roles ( as those 
incumbents were exclusively committed to Owl) and broadly for proposing personnel 
who lacked experience.  Id. at 26-27.   
 The Navy counters that its evaluation reasonably assessed both firms ’ proposals under 
technical element A.   The agency argues that it accurately recognized the advantages 
and weaknesses of both firms ’ proposals , and that Owl’s protest centers on 
disagreement with the agency ’s evaluation judgments, principally the agency ’s 
judgment about the value of specific aspects which the agency subsequently 
determined were offset by distinct aspects of PCCI ’s proposal, and whether Owl ’s 
remaining advantage to the agency under the personnel element was more significant than the agency ’s considered evaluation judgment concluded.  Memorandum of 
Law (MOL) at 3 -10.  None of these allegations provide a basis to sustain the protest, the 
Navy argues .   
In reviewing a protester ’s challenges to a technical evaluation, our Office affords 
discretion to the procuring agency because it is responsible both for defining its needs 
and assessing the best method for accommodating them.  So, in reviewing an agency ’s 
evaluation, our Office does not reevaluate the technical proposals, but instead we  Page 10   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 examine the agency ’s evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with 
the solicitation’ s stated evaluation criteria and with procurement statutes and 
regulations.  Shearwater Sys. LLC , B-413573 et al. , Nov. 16, 2016,  2016 CPD ¶  335 
at 3.  Where an agency ’s evaluation judgment is reasonable, a protester ’s disagreement 
with that judgment is insufficient to provide a basis to sustain the protest. XLA Assocs., 
Inc., B-412333.2, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CP D ¶ 54 at 6.  Also, where a protester contends 
that the record shows unequal evaluation treatment, the protester must show that the 
difference in the evaluation did not result from differences in the offerors ’ proposals  that 
support the differing evaluation judgments .  A&T Sys., Inc. , B-410767, Feb. 10, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 95 at 3.   
The record confirms the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation of both proposals 
under element A, personnel.  In particular, the evaluation recognized and assigned a significant strength to Owl ’s proposal regarding the retention of incumbent key  
personnel  and most  incumbent non- key personnel.   But the agency also found 
acceptable PCCI ’s approach which provided committed candidates for all key personnel 
positions, even if most were not the incumbent s in their positions.  The protester  and the 
agency  differ in their views of Owl’ s overall advantage under element A, which the 
agency valued less than the protester contends it should have.  That judgment is a matter of agency discretion and, on the record here, there is no basis for our Office to conclude that the Navy ’s judgment that the value to the Navy of Owl’ s advantage under 
the personnel element was slight, was an unreasonable judgment.  See XLA Assocs., 
Inc., supra, at 6.  
 Next, Owl contends the agency unequally evaluated proposals.  And while the record 
confirms that both firms proposed the same person for lead engineer , the record 
nevertheless supports the agency ’s evaluation judgment to assess  a weakness to Owl ’s 
proposal for the lack of a credentialed professional engineer but not PCCI ’s.  The 
agency determined that PCCI ’s proposal should not receive the same weakness 
because PCCI proposed [ DELETED] , thereby supplying the missing skills and 
professional credential  and effectively mitigating the agency ’s concern.  Although Owl 
believes that the mitigation is insignificant because the employee is  [DELETED] , the 
record is clear that PCCI , unlike Owl, expressly offer ed to hav e a [DELETED] .  
Accordingly, our review supports the reasonableness of the agency ’s evaluation 
judgment in this regard and does not demonstrate unequal treatment ; rather, the firms ’ 
proposed different approaches support the reasonableness of the evaluation of each, even though the same lead engineer was proposed by both and did not possess a 
professional engineer credential for either offeror.   
 With respect to Owl ’s challenges to whether PCCI ’s proposed personnel possessed 
sufficient experience, we again conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation.  The evaluation considered the qualifications of each of PCCI ’s 
candidates for the positions challenged by Owl , compared them to the position 
requirements in the RFP,  and concluded that the candidates were acceptable.  For 
example, t he resume for PCCI ’s program manager showed that the candidate had 
35 years of experienc e supporting the ESSM program that included on- site and field 
experience , which plainly satisfied the RFP ’s qualifications requirement.  Compare AR,  Page 11   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Tab 2a, RFP attach. J -2, at 8 (requiring the program manager to have 15 years of 
experience  in “management of [g]overnment contract activities ”) with AR, Tab 8 a, PCCI 
Tech. Proposal at 30 (listing proposed program manager experience as including over 
30 years of qualifying experience  supporting the ESSM program ).  Ultimately, Owl’s 
protest fails to show that the Navy ’s evaluation judgments in identifying and determining 
the significance of weaknesses in PCCI ’s personnel under element A was 
unreasonable.   
 Under element B , management, Owl argues that the Navy unreasonably  evaluated 
PCCI ’s approach as superior to Owl ’s, both as to their transition plans and their training 
plans .  The firm challenges a weakness  the Navy assessed for the firm’ s transition plan 
under technical element B, which was based on language in Owl ’s proposal indicating 
that its approach included transition functions being performed [ DELETED] .  Protest at  
7.  Owl argues that the evaluation misinterpreted that aspect of its approach as 
requiring staff to perform transition duties [ DELETED] .  Id.  The firm argues that its 
proposal only proposed t o have a limited set of key personnel “ provide limited on- site 
support, as necessary ” to supplement a dedicated transition staff.  Id.  at 36.   
Additionally, rather than assessing a weakness, the approach instead should have been recognized as providing value through the retention of knowledgeable incumbent personnel.  Id.
6   
 
6 Owl also argues that the Navy conducted misleading discussions  by identifying 
concerns with the risks and lack of mitigation in its approach to transition.  Owl 
maintains that it was misled to emphasize the lack of transition risks rather than address 
the agency ’s concern that its approach posed a risk by overburdening its staff with 
[DELETED ] transition duties .  Owl maintains that the discussions also misled it by not 
directing its response to focus on providing specificity about its transition.  Protest at 7, 39; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  To be meaningful, discussions must be 
sufficiently detailed to lead an offeror to the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or revision.   Partnership for Supply Chain Mgmt. , B-411490, B -411490.2, Aug. 11, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 252 at 5 .   
Owl fails to show that the agency ’s discussion inquiry was misleading; rather, the record 
shows that the agency identified a concern that the approach did not adequately identify transition risks and did not explain how areas of risk would be mitigated.   Indeed, the 
agency ’s discussion communication quoted from Owl ’s proposal regarding the 
involvement of [ DELETED]  in transition, and then expressed the concern that the 
approach did not give the evaluators confidence that the firm had  properly analyzed the 
transition process from the incumbent joint venture to Owl itself being the contractor.  
AR, Tab 3, Navy Discussions to Owl at 1- 2.  Contrary to Owl ’s arguments, the 
discussions thus reasonably led Owl to the area of the agency ’s evaluated concern 
about the source of risk in its transition approach and the firm’ s apparent failure to 
appreciate and mitigate the risk.  While Owl ’s final proposal revision failed to allay the 
concerns raised by the agency, that outcome does not demonstrate a flaw in the agency ’s discussions.    Page 12   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Owl also argues that the Navy misevaluated PCCI ’s proposal by failing to assess 
weaknesses because PCCI did not propose incumbent key personnel, and therefore its 
transition would necessarily involve significant risk .  Owl contends  this was confirmed 
after award when PCCI sought information about personnel, benefits, and ongoing 
orders that allegedly show the firm lacked a feasible approach to transition.  Protest 
at 7, 41-42.   
 
Owl also challenges a weakness assessed against its proposal for  its proposed training 
plan.   Specifically, the agency identified a weakness with Owl ’s propos al to provide 
underwater ships husbandry (UWSH)7 training.  T he agency concluded that Owl ’s plan 
reflected an overreliance on conducting training during [DELETED] .  The Navy deemed 
reliance on [ DELETED]  for training problematic because their scheduling was uncertain 
and, [DELETED] .  Owl counters that its UWSH training was multifaceted, and only one 
element was to send personnel to “ receive regular training during [ DELETED] .”  
Additionally, Owl contends that its plan provided that personnel would only be assigned to [DELETED]  if they had other duties to perform.  Protest at 4 3-45.   
 
The Navy argues that the evaluation under element B was reasonable and consistent 
with the evaluation criteria.  With respect to the firms ’ respective transition approaches, 
the agency argues that , contrary to Owl ’s description of its transition approach as 
seamless and low risk, its proposal was reasonably assessed a weakness because the 
firm failed to appreciate and address the risk in transitioning from performance by the 
incumbent joint venture to Owl itself, notably including the approach of having 
[DELETED ].
8  MOL at  12-15.  In contrast, the agency argues, PCCI ’s approach to 
transition was detailed and insightful , and the evaluation explained in detail why the 
firm’s approach provided confidence in the firm ’s ability to accomplish a smooth and 
seamless transition, and thus merited a strength.   Id. at 16; AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 
15.  The agency argues that PCCI ’s efforts to obtain information from Owl after award, 
as an effort to facilitate the transition,  do not support the protester ’s claim that PCCI ’s 
proposed transition plan (or, for that matter, its approach to recruiting and retaining 
personnel) was defective.  MOL at 30.  In addition, the agency asserts  that those events 
are matters of contract administr ation rather than evidence of a flaw in the evaluation of 
PCCI ’s transition plan under technical element B .  Id.   
 
 
7 In brief, UWSH involves performing ship maintenance or  repair underwater.  The 
contract requires the contractor to maintain prepositioned equipment that is needed to 
perform UWSH tasks, so the contractor personnel who maintain that equipment and support it when deployed must receive training to ensure their s kills are current.   
8 Owl argues that any legitimate concern about its plan to transition duties [ DELETED]  
was mitigated by proposing the possibility of obtaining an agreement from the 
incumbent joint venture for the key personnel to perform transition duties  [DELETED] .  
We see no error in the Navy ’s decision not to give this alternative any weight because it 
was merely hypothetical.    Page 13   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 With respect to Owl’ s UWSH training plan, the Navy argues that the evaluation 
reasonably assessed Owl ’s approach and determined that using [ DELETED]  
opportunities as an element of the approach represented overreliance on an approach 
that was uncertain and inconsistent.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 27.  To the extent Owl 
argues that the agency focused unreasonably on one element of its UWSH techniques, the agency counters that the proposal identified training during [DELETED]  as 
significant, stating that the f irm’s “UWSH mechanics receive regular training [ DELETED]  
to qualify and stay proficient on all ESSM UWSH equipment and tools .”  AR, Tab 9a, 
Owl Tech . Proposal at 85 (proposal page No. I -64).  At the same time, the evaluators 
found that Owl ’s proposal did not provide detail about the significance and scope of the 
other training elements , making only brief mention of [ DELETED] , and thus the 
evaluators ’ assessment of a weakness was reasonable.  MOL at  20.   
 Our review of the record supports the Navy ’s evaluation of both weaknesses.  
Accordingly, we deny Owl ’s challenges to the evaluation under element B.
9  As 
described above, the agency identified a reasonable concern about the increased risk 
resulting from  Owl’s proposed transition approach, which included key personnel  
[DELETED ].  See AR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at  117 (proposal page No.  I-96, 
stating “[w]e understand that during the transition period [ DELETED] ”).  Although Owl 
argues that the risk was minimal and manageable, the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation of that element of the approach as a 
weakness.  The record also shows that the Navy reasonably found PCCI ’s transition 
approach had merit even though it did not include most of the incumbent key personnel including PCCI ’s identification of transition risks and mitigation strategies.   
Similarly, the record supports the Navy ’s assessment of a weakness to Owl for its 
UWSH training approach.  The evaluators reasonably understood Owl ’s approach as 
identifying an essential element of its UWSH training as  occurring [DELETED] .  See 
AR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at 86- 87 (proposal page Nos. I -65 to I -66, explaining 
importance of [DELETED]  experience for mechanics, identifying specific equipment 
training as “ [DELETED] ,” and that salvage- specific training “ will typically [ DELETED] ”).  
The agency also reasonably viewed reliance presented a risk first because [DELETED] 
did not always take place when planned, and second because it could promot e 
inefficient  expenditure of time and expense to [ DELETED] .  Accordingly, we deny Owl ’s 
challenges to the evaluation under technical element B.   
 
9 In addition to challenging its own evaluation, Owl also argues that PCCI ’s approach to 
UWSH should have been evaluated as inadequate and lacking detail but was instead unreasonably assessed as a strength.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The Navy refutes Owl ’s challenge, noting that the evaluators credited PCCI for  proposing to 
provide training [ DELETED] , and would provide the training [ DELETED] , all of which the 
evaluators viewed as valuable.  MOL at 3 3.  Even if PCCI ’s UWSH approach was not 
described in detail, the record supports the reasonableness of the assessment of a significant strength for PCCI ’s UWSH training.   Page 14   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Next, Owl challenges the evaluation under both element C, technical capability and 
experience , and factor 2, past performance.  Owl contends that the evaluation under 
both criteria unreasonably found that both firms had the same experience in performing 
ESSM as a result of their roles in the incumbent joint venture, despite Owl ’s assertion 
that it was both the majority owner of the joint venture and performed more of the work .  
Although the element C evaluation concluded that Owl had a slight advantage over PCCI, Owl argues that its own role in the incumbent joint venture was much more 
significant than PCCI ’s and should have been c onsidered significantly superior.  The 
protester alleges that PCCI did not perform many SOW requirements (such as training, 
management, and specialty system procurement)  and, consequen tly, the evaluation 
should have recognized a significant advantage for Owl over PCCI.  Protest at 65.  The protester also asserts that the Navy should have known that PCCI ’s claims of broad 
experience and past performance under the incumbent contract were inaccurate, and that the evaluation was improper because it was based on alleged misrepresentations 
by PCCI.  Protest at  61-64; Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 36.  
 The Navy argues that the evaluation of experience and capability under technical element C, and the evaluation of past performance, were both reasonable.  The Navy maintains that regardless of Owl ’s role in the joint venture, PCCI ’s proposal adequately 
demonstrated the firm ’s possession of the range of experience in ESSM requirements 
and related areas.  MOL at 40- 42.  The agency notes that PCCI has been involved in 
the incumbent joint venture for more than 30 years.  Additionally, the agency notes that in at least one area where PCCI lack ed experience and past performance on the ESSM 
contract, it demonstrated that experience and past performance on a non- ESSM 
contract.  Id. at 43.  The agency contends that it reasonably concluded that both firms 
demonstrated the required capability and experience and relevant past performance, and concluded that both firms ’ evaluations had similar merit , and Owl ’s advantage 
under the experience element was slight .   
 In response to Owl ’s contention that PCCI misrepresented its role in the incumbent 
contract and thus misled the Navy with respect to the firm ’s experience and past 
performance, PCCI directly disputes each of the alleged misrepresentations.  PCCI ’s 
president avers that the firm participates actively in management through two members of the joint venture’ s five -member board, and its executive filled the roles of chief 
operating officer (and two subordinates) until 2021, contrary to Owl ’s claim that the 
awardee has had little involvement in management.  Intervenor ’s Supp. Comments 
at 21; exh. A, Decl. of PCCI President at 1.  Further, the awardee explains that its 
personnel often interact directly with the Navy during performance of the incumbent contract.  Id.  The firm also challenges the contention that PCCI ’s proposed program 
manager has had little on- site experience during performance of the incumbent 
contract, supporting its claim with multiple examples by the candidate of both on- site 
performance and serv ice as the primary point of contact for specific projects.  Id.; 
exh. B, Decl. of PCCI Chief Exec. Officer at 6 -8.   
In a protest challenging the evaluation of experience or past performance, our Office considers the evaluation to be generally committed to the discretion of the contracting 
agency , so we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance  Page 15   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 ratings.  We will review the record to determine whether the agency conducted the 
evaluation fairly, reasonably, and in accordance with the solicitation’ s evaluation 
scheme, and whether it was based on relevant information sufficient to make a 
reasonable assessment of the offeror ’s experience and record of performance.   Fidelity

 We see no basis to find unreasonable the evaluative weight the agency assessed for 
experience and past performance between the joint venture members  that Owl 
contends was required.  To the contrary, PCCI explains that our Office has recognized experience and past performance gained by a joint venture can properly be credited to a member of the joint venture that is involved in the performance.  Intervenor ’s Supp. 
Comments at 3 (citing  Diversified Tech. & Servs. of Virginia, Inc. , B-412090.2, 
B-412090.3, Dec . 16, 2015, 2016 CPD ¶ 34 at 9 and Battelle Mem ’l Inst., B-278673, 
Feb. 27, 1998, 98- 1 CPD ¶ 107 at 22 ).  While Owl contends that the evaluation had to 
consider its own experience superior because of its slightly greater ownership of the joint venture (51 percent versus 49 percent)  and allegedly more comprehensive 
involvement in performance, the agency reasonably evaluated both and, although there were differences, the agency reasonably concluded that the difference did not 
distinguish one above the other u nder either technical element C or the past 
performance factor.  Nor does the record provide a basis to conclude that PCCI 
misrepresented its experience or past performance under the incumbent contract given the firm’ s direct and detailed rebuttal of the protester ’s allegation of misrepresentations.  
Owl has provided no basis to sustain its challenges to those evaluations.   
 Under element D, Owl argues that the Navy misevaluated the firm ’s sample problem 
response.   The sample problem required each offeror to provide a response to a 
scenario in which a collision between a Navy ship and a barge that caused damage and evidence of leaking hydraulic fluid and heavy black oil into the water.  AR, Tab 2f, 
Sample Problem at 1.   The instructions included two tentative equipment lists, and 
directed offerors to prepare a plan to respond, that should include “ any 
recommendations [the offeror] would make to equipment lists and/or mobilization strategies with justifications for t hose recommendations.  Id. at 2.   
 Owl argues that its approach was derived from the extensive experience of its 
incumbent key personnel and should not have been assessed a weakness for a discrepancy .  Protest at 55 .  The firm argues that its sample problem response included 
the tentative equipment list that the agency had supplied in a r equisition and 
invoice/ shipping document  (known as DD1149) , but also listed additional equipment 
items separately.  Id. at 56.   The Navy assessed weakness es because of discrepancies 
in the documentation of equipment Owl proposed to utilize, and in the timing of its equipment shipments.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 33.   The firm argues that the 
assessment of weakness es was based on an unreasonable interpretation of Owl ’s 
sample problem respons e.   
  Page 16   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The Navy argues that the sample problem evaluation was reasonable.  The agency 
notes that the sample problem was timed and was intended to assess the offeror ’s 
ability to evaluate an emergent situation and prepare a clear plan to respond.  The discrepancy between the equipment lists showed discrepancies over the need for a 
specific piece of equipment (a stern tube cofferdam) and the firm listed different shipping timelines  for needed equipment .  Compare AR, Tab 10, Owl Sample Problem 
Response at 14- 17 with 19 (required equipment documentation), 22 with 24 (equipment 
arrival timing); MOL at 44- 45.  The agency explains that if the sample problem had been 
a real -world event, the discrepancies could interfere with efficient response to the 
situation and could result in a needed piece of equipment failing to ship to the incident 
on time.  The issue reasonably resulted in assessment of a weakness, the agency contends.  Id. at 45.   
 Based on our review of the record, the agency ’s technical evaluation of Owl ’s sample 
problem response was reasonable.  The RFP provided that the sample problem response would be evaluated to assess the offeror ’s response in a problem -solving 
exercise, whether the offeror understood and would respond to the requirements of the scenario.  It advised offerors to provide comprehensive responses that address the full extent of support and field operations as if it were a real -world event.  AR, Tab 2, RFP 
at 80.  By providing equipment documentation and shipping timelines that were 
inconsistent, Owl ’s sample problem response was reasonably assessed a weakness.  
In sum, we deny all of Owl ’s technical factor evaluation challenges.   
Other Cost/Price Evaluation Challenges  
 
Under the cost/price factor, apart from the challenge to the Navy ’s failure to properly 
evaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 discussed above, 
Owl also argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider the risk posed by PCCI ’s 
proposal of low indirect cost rates and further, a proposed ceiling, or cap,  on its  indirect 
cost rate.  The firm argues that PCCI ’s approach involves  establishment of  [DELETED]  
for cost purposes, and that the available data of audited rates for PCCI ’s [DELETED]  
calculated [DELETED]  indirect rates than the firm proposed.   Those circumstances 
indicate a significant risk , it contends,  because by [DELETED] , PCCI will be unable to 
recover its cost of performance under the ESSM contract .  As a result, Owl argues that 
performance of the contract at PCCI ’s proposed costs will place the firm  in financial 
distress and will incentivize the firm to minimize its efforts on the contract to lim it its 
losses .  Owl argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider these risks in evaluating 
PCCI ’s cost proposal .   
 The Navy argues that its evaluation of both firms ’ costs proposals was consistent with 
the evaluation criteria in the RFP .  The agency acknowledges that the RFP provided 
that the cost evaluation would include a cost realism assessment for offeror’ s indirect 
rates .  However, it encouraged offerors to propose indirect rate ceilings and further 
explained their treatment as follows:   Page 17   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Evaluation of Indirect Rates and Ceilings  
 
If the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost -
realism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the proposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.   If proposed indirect rates are considered to 
be unrealistic, the Offeror ’s proposed rates will be adjusted upward to 
determine the Government evaluated indirect rate .  No downward 
adjustment will be made to an Offeror ’s rates during the cost realism 
analysis . 
 If the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate represents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic .  
 RFP at 113  (§ M, 2.3.1.2). 
 The Navy argues that since both offerors proposed caps on all indirect costs, the Navy 
properly calculated each firm ’s costs by using the capped rates and deem ing the firm’s 
capped rates to be realistic .  The Navy maintains that the evaluation was consistent with 
the RFP, and that the evaluation of risk from PCCI ’s allegedly low indirect rates and 
ceilings, that Owl argues  for, was not required under the term s of the RFP .   
 As a general principle, the FAR provides that when evaluating offerors ’ costs for a 
cost-reimbursement contract, the agency must assess the realism of the offeror ’s 
proposed costs; that is, a cost realism analysis .  FAR 15 .404-1.  The requirement to 
assess cost realism is to recognize that the offeror ’s proposed costs are not dispositive 
in a cost -reimbursement environment ; that is, even if the offeror proposes that its costs 
will be low, the government generally will be liable to the contractor for all allowable and 
allocable costs incurred in connection with the performance of the contract .  Vectrus 
Mission Sols . Corp .; Vanquish Worldwide, LLC , B-418942 et al., Oct . 27, 2020, 2021 
CPD ¶ 87 at 5 .  The analysis involves   
 
independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror ’s 
proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials descri bed in the offeror ’s technical 
proposal . 
 FAR 15 .404-1(d)(1) .   
 Here, t he record does not show a basis to sustain Owl ’s challenges to the evaluation of 
PCCI ’s costs,  even if its proposal included indirect cost caps  that turn out to be far 
below the costs that PCCI will actually incur  during performance.   While a cost realism  Page 18   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 analysis may provide a basis to consider the risk posed by an offeror proposing cost 
caps that could create incentives for minimal or poor performance, the RFP here 
expressly provided that the Navy would consider proposed indirect cost caps to be 
realistic , hence, without regard to the cap level or the potential effects, such as an 
offeror ’s potential financial losses or distorted performance incentives .  Accordingly , the 
agency ’s treatment of PCCI’ s capped indirect rates as realistic (and likewise for Owl10) 
was consistent with the RFP .  Accordingly, we deny the protest er’s challenges to the 
evaluation under the cost/price factor .   
 Tradeoff  
 Finally, although Owl challenges the reasonableness of the Navy ’s tradeoff  and 
selection of PCCI ’s proposal, we do not reach the merits of these challenges because 
we conclude that without properly evaluating the offerors ’ professional compensation as 
the RFP provided, the Navy could not reasonably select PCCI ’s proposal as the best 
value.  Accordingly, we sustain the challenge to the agency’s tradeoff .   
 RECOMMENDATION  We recommend that the Navy reevaluate offerors ’ proposals in accordance with the 
RFP, and in particular FAR provision 52.222- 46.  If the Navy ’s evaluation reasonably 
determines that an offeror ’s professional compensation is unrealistically low , the Navy 
should consider whether the circumstances justify rejecting the proposal, pursuant to 
FAR provision 52.222- 46(d).   The Navy may consider reopening discussions if the Navy 
determines that obtaining more information would be in the agency’s interest.   We 
further recommend that the Navy make a new source selection determination and, if 
PCCI is not selected for award, we recommend that the agency terminate the award to PCCI for the convenience of the government and make a new award, if otherwise 
proper.  Finally, we recommend that the agency reimburse Owl’ s costs associated with 
filing and pursuing these protests, including reasonable attorneys ’ fees.  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.8(d)(1).  Owl should submit its certified claim for costs, detailing the time expended 
and costs incurred, directly to the contracting agency within 60 days after the receipt of 
this decision.   
 
The protest is sustained in part and denied in part .

 1.  Protest that agency misevaluated proposals by failing to assess professional compensation plans as provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation provision 52.222- 46 
is sustained where solicitation required offerors to submit information necessary to perform an evaluation and agency did not perform the required evaluation.   
 2.  Protest that agency misevaluated technical and past performance proposals is 
denied where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation criteria.   
 3.  Protest that agency misevaluated proposed costs by considering capped indirect 
costs to be realistic is denied where the solicitation provided for that treatment, and the evaluation was thus consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  
 
DECISION  
 Owl International Inc ., doing business as  Global, a 1st Flagship Company , of Irvine, 
California, protests the award of a contract to PCCI, Inc ., of Alexandria, Virginia, under 
request for proposals (RFP) No. N00024- 23-R-4304, issued by the Department of the 
Navy , Naval Sea Systems Command, for services to manage, operate, and maintain 
the emergency ship salvage material (ESSM) system and support the Navy ’s oil and DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 hazardous substance spill response program  worldwide .  The incumbent contractor is a 
joint venture named Global PCCI JV, whose majority owner at 51 percent is the 
protester , Owl, and the awardee, PCCI, is the minority owner  at 49 percent .  Owl 
contends that the Navy misevaluated both firms ’ proposals and made an unreasonable 
source selection decision.   
 
We sustain the protest  in part and deny it in part .   
 BACKGROUND  
 The Navy issued the RFP on September 28, 2023, to obtain proposals to provide 
services under an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract for five years, 
with a maximum value of $315 million.   Agency Report ( AR), Tab 2 , Consolidated RFP 
at 1-3.  Offeror s were directed to price services on a cost -plus-award- fee basis for 
operational efforts, and on a cost -plus-fixed -fee basis for nonoperational efforts .  Id. 
at 2.  The RFP included a statement of work  (SOW) that described the general scope of 
the contract as providing engineering and technical services to support the ESSM system, provide operational and nonoperational support to the Navy ’s oil and hazardous 
substance spill response program.  Additionally, the contractor would provide equipment operation, maintenance, and related support at remote sites for a range of operations.   
Id. at 15. 
 The RFP instructed offerors to submit proposals in three volumes:  t echnical (volume I), 
cost/price (volume II), and solicitation package (volume III) .  Id. at 72 .  The RFP 
anticipated the award of a single IDIQ contract to the offeror whose proposal was 
evaluated as offering the best value to the government .  The evaluation of proposals 
would utilize three factors, listed in descending order of importance:  t echnical 
capability , past performance, and c ost/price.  Id. at 10 9.  When combined, t he technical 
capability and past performance factors were significantly more important than cost/price  in determining which proposal provided the best value; in other words , the 
RFP indicated that the source selection would be based on a tradeoff among the 
technical capability, past performance, and cost/price factors .  Id.   
 Under the technical factor, t he RFP instructed offerors to address three elements in 
their technical proposals :  personnel; management
1; and technical capability and 
experience .  Id. at 74 -80.  Additionally, the RFP identified  a fourth technical element, a 
sample problem, and stated that it would be optional for the agency  to require .2  Id. 
at 80.  The evaluation of each element was described as follows:    
 
1 In the record, the management element is also referred to as the management 
approach/organization plan element .  E.g., AR, Tab 1, Contracting Officer ’s 
Statement  (COS) at  2.   
2 Ultimately, after receiving proposals, the Navy  issue d a sample problem .  A challenge 
to the evaluation of PCCI’s sample problem was among several issues that our Office 
indicated would likely be dismissed, but the protester subsequently withdrew  it.    Page 3   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The evaluation standard is:  
• Element A:  Personnel .  The degree to which the proposal 
demonstrates that the Offeror is capable of providing personnel 
with the professional and technical skills to successfully perform the 
requirements of the [statement of work] . 
• Element B:  Management .  The degree to which the proposal 
demonstrates that the Offeror ’s management 
approach/organization plan is adequate to accomplish program objectives and satisfy all aspects of the [statement of work] and ESSM mission requirements based on the ESSM Operations Guide.   
• Element C:  Technical Capability and Experience.   The degree to 
which the proposal demonstrates that the Offeror has the 
necessary technical capability and corporate experience related to 
storage, maintenance and operation of ESSM -type facilities, 
equipment, and systems .  
• Element D:  Sample Problem .  The degree to which the response to 
the sample problem .  . . demonstrates the Offeror ’s understanding 
of the Government ’s requirements and the ability to adequately and 
realistically solve a problem in a condensed period of time .   
 
Id. at 109- 110.   
 Within the technical capability evaluation,  proposals were to be evaluated under each of 
the four elements  described above, but the RFP expressly stated the elements were not 
considered subfactors and would not be separately rated.   Id.  The RFP also listed 
subject areas within elements that offerors were instructed to address ; for example, key 
personnel resumes under the personnel element, and nine areas under the management approach/organization plan element,  such as overall organizational 
structure , staffing levels , and training .  Id. at 75- 79.  The RFP also stated that the 
technical capability evaluation would result in assessment of combined technical/risk ratings using color and adjectival rating pairs:  blue/outstanding, purple/good, 
green/acceptable, yellow/marginal, or red/unacceptable.   Id. at 110.   
 Under the past performance factor, the RFP indicated that the agency would evaluate the recency, relevance, and quality of the offeror ’s performance record.   Id. at 111.
3  
The evaluation would then rate each performance reference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant.  Id.   Then, taking into account  the relevance of the 
references and the record of performance, the offeror ’s overall past performance would 
be assessed a confidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, unknown (or neutral), limited, or no confidence.  Id.  at 112.  
 
 
3 Where page numbering in a document differs from the electronic pagination in the 
Adobe PDF file submitted to our Office, we cite the PDF page numbering.    Page 4   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The cost/price evaluation would be based on a total evaluated cost/price, using cost 
information provided by the offeror, principally scheduled labor rates, indirect rates, and 
the offeror ’s award fee/fixed fee.  Id.   Additionally, the RFP directed offerors to complete 
an accompanying cost worksheet by providing standard and overtime labor rates, and percentages for the firm ’s proposed fringe benefit rate, overhead rate, and general and 
administrative rate.  AR, Tab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2.  For scheduled labor r ates, the 
RFP explained that offerors were to propose burdened rates , excluding fee amounts, 
and therefore the Navy would “ only evaluate the proposed scheduled labor rates for 
reasonableness and material balance. ”  Id. at 113.  Additionally, the RFP incorporated 
FAR provision 52.222- 46, which provides for an assessment of the compensation of 
professional employees.  Id. at 90.   
 For indirect rates, the RFP specified different evaluation methods depending on whether the offeror proposed to cap its indirect rates:   
If the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost-realism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the 
proposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.  If proposed indirect rates are 
considered to be unrealistic, the Offeror ’s proposed rates will  be adjusted 
upward to determine the Government evaluated indirect rate.  No 
downward adjustment will be made. . . .  
If the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate 
represents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic.  
 Id. at 113.   
 Finally, the RFP provided that for purposes of evaluation, the offeror ’s proposed award-
fee and fixed- fee “evaluated fee percentages will be equal to the proposed fee 
percentages. ”  Id.   
 
After an initial evaluation, the Navy held discussions with both offerors and requested 
final proposal revisions.  The evaluation of final proposal revisions identified strengths and weaknesses in both firms ’ proposals  under the technical capability factor .  The 
agency then determined that in comparing the firms ’ evaluations, some strengths and 
weaknesses were offset by strengths or weaknesses of similar significance in the competing proposal, and thus were considered offsetting.  Other strengths and weaknesses were determined not to have offsetting aspects in the competitor ’s 
proposal, and thus provided aspects with which to discriminate between the two proposals.  AR, Tab 6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at 8- 16.  For 
the past performance factor, the agency determined that both offerors had demonstrated performance records that were similar in relevance and quality, and that no aspect of the past performance evaluation provided a basis to distinguish between the com petitors.  Id. at 17.    Page 5   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 In addition to those discriminating strengths and weaknesses, the overall evaluation 
produced the following ratings and total evaluated cost/prices:

 AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 7, 24; AR, Tab 6 , 
SSAC Report at 4; AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 3.    
The SSAC advised that its review determined that PCCI ’s proposal was superior to an 
extent that justified paying its higher total evaluated cost/price, which represented a cost premium of 5 percent.   AR, Tab 6, SSAC Report at 18 -19.  The source selection 
authority ( SSA) then reviewed the evaluation and tradeoff recommendation and 
concurred with them .  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  2.  The SSA then explained that based on 
independent judgment, PCCI ’s proposal represented the best value considering its 
superior technical evaluation, and cost/price premium of 5 percent.  Based on that judgment, the SSA selected PCCI for award.  Id.  at 3.  Following notice of the award 
and a debriefing, Owl filed this protest.   
 DISCUSSION  Owl challenges multiple aspects of the evaluation and source selection decision.   We 
first turn to the protester ’s argument that PCCI was not a responsible contractor, which 
we dismiss as lacking a sufficient factual basis.  We next determine that Owl ’s challenge 
to the Navy ’s failure to perform an evaluation of the offerors ’ professional compensation 
is valid and we sustain the protest on that basis .  We then address the protester ’s 
remaining challenges to the evaluation of proposals, which we conclude are without 
merit.    
 Challenge to Affirmative Responsibility Determination  
 Owl’s protest contends that PCCI lacked the financial capacity to perform the contract, 
and that the Navy ignored information regarding that lack of financial capacity that should have caused the Navy to find the firm not responsible to perform the contract.  Protest at 66.  In this regard, Owl asserts that PCCI proposed to cap its indirect costs below their documented historical rates and contends that PCCI also lacks adequate sources of financing that it will need to perform.  Id.   In Owl ’s view, the circ umstances 
indicate that PCCI has less than a half million dollars in working capital, but its capped indirect costs put it at risk of financial losses that Owl argues could exceed $26 million.  Id.; see also Opp. to Req. for Dismissal at 9.  In sum, Owl argues, the lack of access to 
capital to manage losses resulting from the firm ’s proposed indirect cost cap was  Page 6   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 material information that the Navy failed to adequately consider, which should have 
resulted in the Navy finding PCCI was not a responsible offeror to perform this contract.   
 The Navy argues that Owl ’s challenge to the affirmative responsibility determination of 
PCCI is not an aspect of responsibility that GAO reviews and should therefore be dismissed.  The RFP requirement that the contractor possess financial capability does not establish a specific objective standard that could constitute definitive responsibility criteria, the agency contends.  Req. for Dismissal at 7.  Further, the Navy argues that Owl has not identified a violation of law or regulation, or any information that would “rais[e] serious concerns  that . . . the contracting officer unreasonably failed to consider 
available relevant information”  regarding PCCI ’s responsibility.  Id . at 6.  Rather, the 
agency maintains that the record shows the contracting officer exercised reasonable business judgment in finding that PCCI was a responsible contractor.   
Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. section 21.5(c), generally exclude from our 
review, consideration of protests that challenge an affirmative responsibility determination, with limited exceptions.  Those exceptions include that our Office will consider  a protest alleging that specific objective standards of responsibility were not 
met, and that an affirmative responsibility determination failed to adequately consider information that was known or reasonably should have been known that, by its nature, would be expected to have a strong bearing on whether the awardee should be found 
responsible.  4 C.F.R. § 21.5(c); MVM, Inc ., B-421788. 3, B-421788. 4, Mar. 5, 2024, 
2024 CPD ¶ 63 at 10.  Our decision in MVM  exemplifies the type of information that 
would meet our standard, where publicly available information indicated that the awardee ’s affiliate had settled false claims under a contract with a federal agency.  Id.  
The information at issue here, in contrast, questions PCCI ’s need for and access to 
working ca pital.  It does not rise to the level required by our regulations to support a 
challenge to the Navy ’s responsibility determination.  Instead, Owl ’s allegations raise 
ordinary issues of financial capacity for the Navy to resolve.  We therefore dismiss the challenge to the Navy ’s determination that PCCI is a responsible contractor.   
 Failure to Evaluate Professional Compensation 
 
Owl argues that the Navy failed to assess the realism of the offerors ’ professional 
compensation as required by the RFP, which incorporated Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) provision 52.222-46.  Protest at  72-73.  That provision provides that 
“[t]he professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact 
upon recruiting and retention,  its realism , and its consistency with a total plan for 
compensation. ”  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) .   
 The RFP instructed offerors to provide cost information in the proposal cost/price 
volume, including worksheet L- 2.  While the RFP instructions identified a requirement to 
provide scheduled labor rates, indirect costs, and fringe benefit costs , RFP at 113, it 
also instructed that all cells colored yellow in the worksheet were to be completed, which included a breakdown of the offeror ’s rates by location and performance period 
into fringe rates, overhead rates, and general and administrative rates.  Id. at 84; AR, 
Tab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2 at 6.  Thus, while t he scheduled labor rates were to be  Page 7   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 proposed as fully burdened (exclusive of fee)  fixed hourly rates , offerors were required 
to provide the applicable indirect burden percentages.   
 
The analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46 requires the agency to conduct “ in effect, a 
price realism evaluation regarding an offeror ’s proposed compensation, ” and the agency 
must also “ compare the awardee’ s proposed professional compensation to the 
incumbent ’s.”  Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, Jul.  31, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 259 at 5.    
The Navy and PCCI argue that this ground of protest should be dismissed because the statement that the evaluation of scheduled labor rates would only  consider 
reasonableness and balance was an obvious indication that the agency would not 
evaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52. 222-46, notwithstanding 
the inclusion of that provision in the RFP .  Req . for Dismissal at 8 -10 (arguing the RFP 
“statement excludes the possibility of price realism ”); Intervenor ’s Response to Req.  for 
Dismissal at  18.  Additionally , the Navy argues that the RFP also did not provide for the 
agency to obtain information needed to perform a comparison between the awardee’ s 
professional compensation and the incumbent ’s, thereby making it apparent on the face 
of the RFP that the Navy would not perform the second element of the analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Req. for Dismissal at 8 -9.  The Navy also argues that the 
RFP did not reference submission of a professional compensation plan in the proposal preparation instructions or evaluation criteria and did not request salary information or a 
description of fringe benefits provided to professional employees.  Id.  at 9.  Accordingly , 
the agency argues , the RFP instructions “ directly contradic t[ed]” the evaluation that 
would have been required under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Id.  at 8.   
 
We disagree.
4  The RFP statement limiting the evaluation of the scheduled labor rates 
(to an assessment of reasonableness and material balance) is not contradicted--directly or implicitly --by FAR provision 52.222- 46 since the evaluations consider different 
information.  Specifically, the scheduled labor rates are burdened rates  (what the 
contractor will charge the government,  albeit without fee)  whereas the evaluation under 
FAR provision 52.222- 46 assesses professional employee compens ation, which 
includes “salaries and fringe benefits .”  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a).  Further, although 
the Navy contends that it was apparent to offerors that proposals would not include 
sufficient information to make an analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46, the Navy’s 
position is not supported by the record.  W orksheet L- 2 required offerors to provide the 
Navy the means to calculate both the offeror ’s direct labor rate-- what the offeror will pay 
an employee--and expressly required it to provide fringe benefit rate(s)--the cost of the 
employee’s benefits relative to their wages .  We therefore conclude that the R FP 
provided that the Navy would evaluate professional compensation consistent with FAR provision 52.222- 46, and that the RFP also required offerors to provide at least some 
minimal amount of information necessary for  the Navy to perform an evaluation.  
 
4 Although our Office indicated that dismissal of this ground of protest as untimely 
appeared appropriate, we indicated that view was not a final decision,  and the parties 
could raise additional arguments pending resolution of the protest in th e decision.  
Notice of GAO Ruling on Partial Dismissal Request at 2.    Page 8   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 We have explained that t he purpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 (titled  Evaluation of 
Compensation for Professional Employees ), is to evaluate whether an offeror will obtain 
and keep the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract 
performance, and to evaluate whether it understands the nature of the work to be 
performed.  In the context of a contract where labor is priced by fixed  hourly rates , our 
Office has noted that this FAR provision anticipates an evaluation of whether the offeror 
understands the contract ’s requirements and has offered a compensation plan 
appropriate for those requirements , which requires assessing the offeror ’s proposed 
professional compensation.  The depth of the analysis is a matter of the procuring 
agency ’s judgment, and so, in reviewing a protest challenging the evaluation, we will 
assess whether the agency ’s evaluation was reasonabl e and consistent with the 
solicitation.   Criterion Sys ., Inc., B-419749 et al. , July  21, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  261 at 6- 7.   
 Here, t he Navy failed to assess the information provided in the offerors ’ proposals 
regarding professional compensation; it made no assess ment  of the realism of either 
offeror ’s professional compensation or whether it was lower than the incumbent ’s 
compensation of professionals.  Indeed, the agency emphatically asserts that there was “no doubt that the Navy would not obtain the information needed to evaluate the 
proposals in accordance with FAR 52.222- 46 and would not in fact conduct the 
evaluation. ”  See  Navy Req. for Dismissal at 8.   In res ponse to a question posed by Owl 
during its debriefing, the Navy stated that “The capability to recruit and/or retain personnel at proposed scheduled labor rates was not a specific requirement under Factor 3.0 [the cost/price factor]  and was therefore not evaluated for Volume II [the 
cost/price  proposal].”  Protest exhs. 21- 30, exh. 27, Responses to Owl Debriefing 
Questions at 73 (Answer No. 12).
5   
 The RFP included FAR provision 52.222- 46, which provided that the agency would 
assess professional compensation.  The RFP required offerors to provide sufficient information for the Navy to assess, at a minimum, the offeror ’s direct rate s and fringe 
benefit rates.  Because the Navy failed to perform the analysis required by FAR provision 52.222- 46, we sustain this ground of protest.   
Technical Evaluation Challenges  
 
Turning to the remaining allegations, Owl raises many challenges to the evaluation of 
both firms ’ proposals .  Owl argues that the technical evaluation was unreasonable in 
multiple respects within each element .  Broadly, Owl contends that the Navy failed to 
reasonably consider significant differences in the proposed approaches and the 
resulting performance risk of both offerors, the agency unreasonably undervalued Owl ’s 
retention of most incumbent staff , treated the offerors unequally , and it erroneously 
evaluated PCCI ’s experience based, at least in part, on misrepresentations .  The 
 
5 Since, as noted above, the depth of the evaluation is principally a matter for the 
agency to determine, the fact that the agency did not request or obtain detailed 
compensation plans from either offeror does not mitigate the failure to evaluate the inform ation that was submitted.    Page 9   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 protester also challenges the past performance evaluation as unreasonable and 
contends that the cost evaluation failed to assess the risk posed by PCCI ’s indirect cost 
rate caps .  We have reviewed all of Owl ’s additional arguments and conclude that none, 
with the exception of the agency’s failure to evaluate professional compensation discussed above, provides a basis to sustain the protest .  We discuss only the most 
significant allegations below.   
 Under element A, personnel, the protester argues that the Navy unreasonably failed to 
recognize that Owl ’s proposed approach provided significant advantages over PCCI ’s, 
and that the agency unreasonably discounted those advantages and mischaracterized 
Owl as having only a slight advantage.  Protest at 50- 51.  T he protester contends that 
its proposal provided significant unique value because it would retain [DELETED]  the 
incumbent key personnel ( [DELETED]  of 22 positions , of which nearly all made 
exclusive commitments to Owl ) and would also retain [ DELETED]  of the non- key 
personnel , while  PCCI ’s proposal  did not provide that the firm had commitments to 
retain most incumbent key personnel .  Id. at 51-52.  Owl argues that the Navy correctly 
characterized  this difference as representing a significant advantage to the agency, but 
the evaluators  then unreasonably discounted that  conclusion in the overall assessment 
under the personnel element.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-25.   
 Additionally, Owl argues that the Navy made multiple errors in evaluating PCCI ’s 
proposal.  For one, t he protester contends that the Navy unreasonably minimized the 
significance of PCCI proposing a program manager who lacked relevant on-site and 
field experience and who allegedly would not be committed fully to the ESSM program.  
Id. at 25- 27.  Further, Owl argues that the evaluation of PCCI also overlooked 
weaknesses that should have been assessed for proposing inexperienced personnel in multiple roles, (principally its [ DELETED] ).  Id. at 25-28.  More generally, Owl contends 
that the evaluation of PCCI ’s proposal under element A failed  to adequately consider 
risks arising from PCCI proposing to change over most key personnel roles ( as those 
incumbents were exclusively committed to Owl) and broadly for proposing personnel 
who lacked experience.  Id. at 26-27.   
 The Navy counters that its evaluation reasonably assessed both firms ’ proposals under 
technical element A.   The agency argues that it accurately recognized the advantages 
and weaknesses of both firms ’ proposals , and that Owl’s protest centers on 
disagreement with the agency ’s evaluation judgments, principally the agency ’s 
judgment about the value of specific aspects which the agency subsequently 
determined were offset by distinct aspects of PCCI ’s proposal, and whether Owl ’s 
remaining advantage to the agency under the personnel element was more significant than the agency ’s considered evaluation judgment concluded.  Memorandum of 
Law (MOL) at 3 -10.  None of these allegations provide a basis to sustain the protest, the 
Navy argues .   
In reviewing a protester ’s challenges to a technical evaluation, our Office affords 
discretion to the procuring agency because it is responsible both for defining its needs 
and assessing the best method for accommodating them.  So, in reviewing an agency ’s 
evaluation, our Office does not reevaluate the technical proposals, but instead we  Page 10   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 examine the agency ’s evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with 
the solicitation’ s stated evaluation criteria and with procurement statutes and 
regulations.  Shearwater Sys. LLC , B-413573 et al. , Nov. 16, 2016,  2016 CPD ¶  335 
at 3.  Where an agency ’s evaluation judgment is reasonable, a protester ’s disagreement 
with that judgment is insufficient to provide a basis to sustain the protest. XLA Assocs., 
Inc., B-412333.2, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CP D ¶ 54 at 6.  Also, where a protester contends 
that the record shows unequal evaluation treatment, the protester must show that the 
difference in the evaluation did not result from differences in the offerors ’ proposals  that 
support the differing evaluation judgments .  A&T Sys., Inc. , B-410767, Feb. 10, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 95 at 3.   
The record confirms the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation of both proposals 
under element A, personnel.  In particular, the evaluation recognized and assigned a significant strength to Owl ’s proposal regarding the retention of incumbent key  
personnel  and most  incumbent non- key personnel.   But the agency also found 
acceptable PCCI ’s approach which provided committed candidates for all key personnel 
positions, even if most were not the incumbent s in their positions.  The protester  and the 
agency  differ in their views of Owl’ s overall advantage under element A, which the 
agency valued less than the protester contends it should have.  That judgment is a matter of agency discretion and, on the record here, there is no basis for our Office to conclude that the Navy ’s judgment that the value to the Navy of Owl’ s advantage under 
the personnel element was slight, was an unreasonable judgment.  See XLA Assocs., 
Inc., supra, at 6.  
 Next, Owl contends the agency unequally evaluated proposals.  And while the record 
confirms that both firms proposed the same person for lead engineer , the record 
nevertheless supports the agency ’s evaluation judgment to assess  a weakness to Owl ’s 
proposal for the lack of a credentialed professional engineer but not PCCI ’s.  The 
agency determined that PCCI ’s proposal should not receive the same weakness 
because PCCI proposed [ DELETED] , thereby supplying the missing skills and 
professional credential  and effectively mitigating the agency ’s concern.  Although Owl 
believes that the mitigation is insignificant because the employee is  [DELETED] , the 
record is clear that PCCI , unlike Owl, expressly offer ed to hav e a [DELETED] .  
Accordingly, our review supports the reasonableness of the agency ’s evaluation 
judgment in this regard and does not demonstrate unequal treatment ; rather, the firms ’ 
proposed different approaches support the reasonableness of the evaluation of each, even though the same lead engineer was proposed by both and did not possess a 
professional engineer credential for either offeror.   
 With respect to Owl ’s challenges to whether PCCI ’s proposed personnel possessed 
sufficient experience, we again conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation.  The evaluation considered the qualifications of each of PCCI ’s 
candidates for the positions challenged by Owl , compared them to the position 
requirements in the RFP,  and concluded that the candidates were acceptable.  For 
example, t he resume for PCCI ’s program manager showed that the candidate had 
35 years of experienc e supporting the ESSM program that included on- site and field 
experience , which plainly satisfied the RFP ’s qualifications requirement.  Compare AR,  Page 11   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Tab 2a, RFP attach. J -2, at 8 (requiring the program manager to have 15 years of 
experience  in “management of [g]overnment contract activities ”) with AR, Tab 8 a, PCCI 
Tech. Proposal at 30 (listing proposed program manager experience as including over 
30 years of qualifying experience  supporting the ESSM program ).  Ultimately, Owl’s 
protest fails to show that the Navy ’s evaluation judgments in identifying and determining 
the significance of weaknesses in PCCI ’s personnel under element A was 
unreasonable.   
 Under element B , management, Owl argues that the Navy unreasonably  evaluated 
PCCI ’s approach as superior to Owl ’s, both as to their transition plans and their training 
plans .  The firm challenges a weakness  the Navy assessed for the firm’ s transition plan 
under technical element B, which was based on language in Owl ’s proposal indicating 
that its approach included transition functions being performed [ DELETED] .  Protest at  
7.  Owl argues that the evaluation misinterpreted that aspect of its approach as 
requiring staff to perform transition duties [ DELETED] .  Id.  The firm argues that its 
proposal only proposed t o have a limited set of key personnel “ provide limited on- site 
support, as necessary ” to supplement a dedicated transition staff.  Id.  at 36.   
Additionally, rather than assessing a weakness, the approach instead should have been recognized as providing value through the retention of knowledgeable incumbent personnel.  Id.
6   
 
6 Owl also argues that the Navy conducted misleading discussions  by identifying 
concerns with the risks and lack of mitigation in its approach to transition.  Owl 
maintains that it was misled to emphasize the lack of transition risks rather than address 
the agency ’s concern that its approach posed a risk by overburdening its staff with 
[DELETED ] transition duties .  Owl maintains that the discussions also misled it by not 
directing its response to focus on providing specificity about its transition.  Protest at 7, 39; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  To be meaningful, discussions must be 
sufficiently detailed to lead an offeror to the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or revision.   Partnership for Supply Chain Mgmt. , B-411490, B -411490.2, Aug. 11, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 252 at 5 .   
Owl fails to show that the agency ’s discussion inquiry was misleading; rather, the record 
shows that the agency identified a concern that the approach did not adequately identify transition risks and did not explain how areas of risk would be mitigated.   Indeed, the 
agency ’s discussion communication quoted from Owl ’s proposal regarding the 
involvement of [ DELETED]  in transition, and then expressed the concern that the 
approach did not give the evaluators confidence that the firm had  properly analyzed the 
transition process from the incumbent joint venture to Owl itself being the contractor.  
AR, Tab 3, Navy Discussions to Owl at 1- 2.  Contrary to Owl ’s arguments, the 
discussions thus reasonably led Owl to the area of the agency ’s evaluated concern 
about the source of risk in its transition approach and the firm’ s apparent failure to 
appreciate and mitigate the risk.  While Owl ’s final proposal revision failed to allay the 
concerns raised by the agency, that outcome does not demonstrate a flaw in the agency ’s discussions.    Page 12   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Owl also argues that the Navy misevaluated PCCI ’s proposal by failing to assess 
weaknesses because PCCI did not propose incumbent key personnel, and therefore its 
transition would necessarily involve significant risk .  Owl contends  this was confirmed 
after award when PCCI sought information about personnel, benefits, and ongoing 
orders that allegedly show the firm lacked a feasible approach to transition.  Protest 
at 7, 41-42.   
 
Owl also challenges a weakness assessed against its proposal for  its proposed training 
plan.   Specifically, the agency identified a weakness with Owl ’s propos al to provide 
underwater ships husbandry (UWSH)7 training.  T he agency concluded that Owl ’s plan 
reflected an overreliance on conducting training during [DELETED] .  The Navy deemed 
reliance on [ DELETED]  for training problematic because their scheduling was uncertain 
and, [DELETED] .  Owl counters that its UWSH training was multifaceted, and only one 
element was to send personnel to “ receive regular training during [ DELETED] .”  
Additionally, Owl contends that its plan provided that personnel would only be assigned to [DELETED]  if they had other duties to perform.  Protest at 4 3-45.   
 
The Navy argues that the evaluation under element B was reasonable and consistent 
with the evaluation criteria.  With respect to the firms ’ respective transition approaches, 
the agency argues that , contrary to Owl ’s description of its transition approach as 
seamless and low risk, its proposal was reasonably assessed a weakness because the 
firm failed to appreciate and address the risk in transitioning from performance by the 
incumbent joint venture to Owl itself, notably including the approach of having 
[DELETED ].
8  MOL at  12-15.  In contrast, the agency argues, PCCI ’s approach to 
transition was detailed and insightful , and the evaluation explained in detail why the 
firm’s approach provided confidence in the firm ’s ability to accomplish a smooth and 
seamless transition, and thus merited a strength.   Id. at 16; AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 
15.  The agency argues that PCCI ’s efforts to obtain information from Owl after award, 
as an effort to facilitate the transition,  do not support the protester ’s claim that PCCI ’s 
proposed transition plan (or, for that matter, its approach to recruiting and retaining 
personnel) was defective.  MOL at 30.  In addition, the agency asserts  that those events 
are matters of contract administr ation rather than evidence of a flaw in the evaluation of 
PCCI ’s transition plan under technical element B .  Id.   
 
 
7 In brief, UWSH involves performing ship maintenance or  repair underwater.  The 
contract requires the contractor to maintain prepositioned equipment that is needed to 
perform UWSH tasks, so the contractor personnel who maintain that equipment and support it when deployed must receive training to ensure their s kills are current.   
8 Owl argues that any legitimate concern about its plan to transition duties [ DELETED]  
was mitigated by proposing the possibility of obtaining an agreement from the 
incumbent joint venture for the key personnel to perform transition duties  [DELETED] .  
We see no error in the Navy ’s decision not to give this alternative any weight because it 
was merely hypothetical.    Page 13   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 With respect to Owl’ s UWSH training plan, the Navy argues that the evaluation 
reasonably assessed Owl ’s approach and determined that using [ DELETED]  
opportunities as an element of the approach represented overreliance on an approach 
that was uncertain and inconsistent.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 27.  To the extent Owl 
argues that the agency focused unreasonably on one element of its UWSH techniques, the agency counters that the proposal identified training during [DELETED]  as 
significant, stating that the f irm’s “UWSH mechanics receive regular training [ DELETED]  
to qualify and stay proficient on all ESSM UWSH equipment and tools .”  AR, Tab 9a, 
Owl Tech . Proposal at 85 (proposal page No. I -64).  At the same time, the evaluators 
found that Owl ’s proposal did not provide detail about the significance and scope of the 
other training elements , making only brief mention of [ DELETED] , and thus the 
evaluators ’ assessment of a weakness was reasonable.  MOL at  20.   
 Our review of the record supports the Navy ’s evaluation of both weaknesses.  
Accordingly, we deny Owl ’s challenges to the evaluation under element B.
9  As 
described above, the agency identified a reasonable concern about the increased risk 
resulting from  Owl’s proposed transition approach, which included key personnel  
[DELETED ].  See AR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at  117 (proposal page No.  I-96, 
stating “[w]e understand that during the transition period [ DELETED] ”).  Although Owl 
argues that the risk was minimal and manageable, the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy ’s evaluation of that element of the approach as a 
weakness.  The record also shows that the Navy reasonably found PCCI ’s transition 
approach had merit even though it did not include most of the incumbent key personnel including PCCI ’s identification of transition risks and mitigation strategies.   
Similarly, the record supports the Navy ’s assessment of a weakness to Owl for its 
UWSH training approach.  The evaluators reasonably understood Owl ’s approach as 
identifying an essential element of its UWSH training as  occurring [DELETED] .  See 
AR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at 86- 87 (proposal page Nos. I -65 to I -66, explaining 
importance of [DELETED]  experience for mechanics, identifying specific equipment 
training as “ [DELETED] ,” and that salvage- specific training “ will typically [ DELETED] ”).  
The agency also reasonably viewed reliance presented a risk first because [DELETED] 
did not always take place when planned, and second because it could promot e 
inefficient  expenditure of time and expense to [ DELETED] .  Accordingly, we deny Owl ’s 
challenges to the evaluation under technical element B.   
 
9 In addition to challenging its own evaluation, Owl also argues that PCCI ’s approach to 
UWSH should have been evaluated as inadequate and lacking detail but was instead unreasonably assessed as a strength.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The Navy refutes Owl ’s challenge, noting that the evaluators credited PCCI for  proposing to 
provide training [ DELETED] , and would provide the training [ DELETED] , all of which the 
evaluators viewed as valuable.  MOL at 3 3.  Even if PCCI ’s UWSH approach was not 
described in detail, the record supports the reasonableness of the assessment of a significant strength for PCCI ’s UWSH training.   Page 14   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Next, Owl challenges the evaluation under both element C, technical capability and 
experience , and factor 2, past performance.  Owl contends that the evaluation under 
both criteria unreasonably found that both firms had the same experience in performing 
ESSM as a result of their roles in the incumbent joint venture, despite Owl ’s assertion 
that it was both the majority owner of the joint venture and performed more of the work .  
Although the element C evaluation concluded that Owl had a slight advantage over PCCI, Owl argues that its own role in the incumbent joint venture was much more 
significant than PCCI ’s and should have been c onsidered significantly superior.  The 
protester alleges that PCCI did not perform many SOW requirements (such as training, 
management, and specialty system procurement)  and, consequen tly, the evaluation 
should have recognized a significant advantage for Owl over PCCI.  Protest at 65.  The protester also asserts that the Navy should have known that PCCI ’s claims of broad 
experience and past performance under the incumbent contract were inaccurate, and that the evaluation was improper because it was based on alleged misrepresentations 
by PCCI.  Protest at  61-64; Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 36.  
 The Navy argues that the evaluation of experience and capability under technical element C, and the evaluation of past performance, were both reasonable.  The Navy maintains that regardless of Owl ’s role in the joint venture, PCCI ’s proposal adequately 
demonstrated the firm ’s possession of the range of experience in ESSM requirements 
and related areas.  MOL at 40- 42.  The agency notes that PCCI has been involved in 
the incumbent joint venture for more than 30 years.  Additionally, the agency notes that in at least one area where PCCI lack ed experience and past performance on the ESSM 
contract, it demonstrated that experience and past performance on a non- ESSM 
contract.  Id. at 43.  The agency contends that it reasonably concluded that both firms 
demonstrated the required capability and experience and relevant past performance, and concluded that both firms ’ evaluations had similar merit , and Owl ’s advantage 
under the experience element was slight .   
 In response to Owl ’s contention that PCCI misrepresented its role in the incumbent 
contract and thus misled the Navy with respect to the firm ’s experience and past 
performance, PCCI directly disputes each of the alleged misrepresentations.  PCCI ’s 
president avers that the firm participates actively in management through two members of the joint venture’ s five -member board, and its executive filled the roles of chief 
operating officer (and two subordinates) until 2021, contrary to Owl ’s claim that the 
awardee has had little involvement in management.  Intervenor ’s Supp. Comments 
at 21; exh. A, Decl. of PCCI President at 1.  Further, the awardee explains that its 
personnel often interact directly with the Navy during performance of the incumbent contract.  Id.  The firm also challenges the contention that PCCI ’s proposed program 
manager has had little on- site experience during performance of the incumbent 
contract, supporting its claim with multiple examples by the candidate of both on- site 
performance and serv ice as the primary point of contact for specific projects.  Id.; 
exh. B, Decl. of PCCI Chief Exec. Officer at 6 -8.   
In a protest challenging the evaluation of experience or past performance, our Office considers the evaluation to be generally committed to the discretion of the contracting 
agency , so we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance  Page 15   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 ratings.  We will review the record to determine whether the agency conducted the 
evaluation fairly, reasonably, and in accordance with the solicitation’ s evaluation 
scheme, and whether it was based on relevant information sufficient to make a 
reasonable assessment of the offeror ’s experience and record of performance.   Fidelity

 We see no basis to find unreasonable the evaluative weight the agency assessed for 
experience and past performance between the joint venture members  that Owl 
contends was required.  To the contrary, PCCI explains that our Office has recognized experience and past performance gained by a joint venture can properly be credited to a member of the joint venture that is involved in the performance.  Intervenor ’s Supp. 
Comments at 3 (citing  Diversified Tech. & Servs. of Virginia, Inc. , B-412090.2,

Feb. 27, 1998, 98- 1 CPD ¶ 107 at 22 ).  While Owl contends that the evaluation had to 
consider its own experience superior because of its slightly greater ownership of the joint venture (51 percent versus 49 percent)  and allegedly more comprehensive 
involvement in performance, the agency reasonably evaluated both and, although there were differences, the agency reasonably concluded that the difference did not 
distinguish one above the other u nder either technical element C or the past 
performance factor.  Nor does the record provide a basis to conclude that PCCI 
misrepresented its experience or past performance under the incumbent contract given the firm’ s direct and detailed rebuttal of the protester ’s allegation of misrepresentations.  
Owl has provided no basis to sustain its challenges to those evaluations.   
 Under element D, Owl argues that the Navy misevaluated the firm ’s sample problem 
response.   The sample problem required each offeror to provide a response to a 
scenario in which a collision between a Navy ship and a barge that caused damage and evidence of leaking hydraulic fluid and heavy black oil into the water.  AR, Tab 2f, 
Sample Problem at 1.   The instructions included two tentative equipment lists, and 
directed offerors to prepare a plan to respond, that should include “ any 
recommendations [the offeror] would make to equipment lists and/or mobilization strategies with justifications for t hose recommendations.  Id. at 2.   
 Owl argues that its approach was derived from the extensive experience of its 
incumbent key personnel and should not have been assessed a weakness for a discrepancy .  Protest at 55 .  The firm argues that its sample problem response included 
the tentative equipment list that the agency had supplied in a r equisition and 
invoice/ shipping document  (known as DD1149) , but also listed additional equipment 
items separately.  Id. at 56.   The Navy assessed weakness es because of discrepancies 
in the documentation of equipment Owl proposed to utilize, and in the timing of its equipment shipments.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 33.   The firm argues that the 
assessment of weakness es was based on an unreasonable interpretation of Owl ’s 
sample problem respons e.   
  Page 16   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The Navy argues that the sample problem evaluation was reasonable.  The agency 
notes that the sample problem was timed and was intended to assess the offeror ’s 
ability to evaluate an emergent situation and prepare a clear plan to respond.  The discrepancy between the equipment lists showed discrepancies over the need for a 
specific piece of equipment (a stern tube cofferdam) and the firm listed different shipping timelines  for needed equipment .  Compare AR, Tab 10, Owl Sample Problem 
Response at 14- 17 with 19 (required equipment documentation), 22 with 24 (equipment 
arrival timing); MOL at 44- 45.  The agency explains that if the sample problem had been 
a real -world event, the discrepancies could interfere with efficient response to the 
situation and could result in a needed piece of equipment failing to ship to the incident 
on time.  The issue reasonably resulted in assessment of a weakness, the agency contends.  Id. at 45.   
 Based on our review of the record, the agency ’s technical evaluation of Owl ’s sample 
problem response was reasonable.  The RFP provided that the sample problem response would be evaluated to assess the offeror ’s response in a problem -solving 
exercise, whether the offeror understood and would respond to the requirements of the scenario.  It advised offerors to provide comprehensive responses that address the full extent of support and field operations as if it were a real -world event.  AR, Tab 2, RFP 
at 80.  By providing equipment documentation and shipping timelines that were 
inconsistent, Owl ’s sample problem response was reasonably assessed a weakness.  
In sum, we deny all of Owl ’s technical factor evaluation challenges.   
Other Cost/Price Evaluation Challenges  
 
Under the cost/price factor, apart from the challenge to the Navy ’s failure to properly 
evaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 discussed above, 
Owl also argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider the risk posed by PCCI ’s 
proposal of low indirect cost rates and further, a proposed ceiling, or cap,  on its  indirect 
cost rate.  The firm argues that PCCI ’s approach involves  establishment of  [DELETED]  
for cost purposes, and that the available data of audited rates for PCCI ’s [DELETED]  
calculated [DELETED]  indirect rates than the firm proposed.   Those circumstances 
indicate a significant risk , it contends,  because by [DELETED] , PCCI will be unable to 
recover its cost of performance under the ESSM contract .  As a result, Owl argues that 
performance of the contract at PCCI ’s proposed costs will place the firm  in financial 
distress and will incentivize the firm to minimize its efforts on the contract to lim it its 
losses .  Owl argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider these risks in evaluating 
PCCI ’s cost proposal .   
 The Navy argues that its evaluation of both firms ’ costs proposals was consistent with 
the evaluation criteria in the RFP .  The agency acknowledges that the RFP provided 
that the cost evaluation would include a cost realism assessment for offeror’ s indirect 
rates .  However, it encouraged offerors to propose indirect rate ceilings and further 
explained their treatment as follows:   Page 17   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Evaluation of Indirect Rates and Ceilings  
 
If the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost -
realism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the proposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.   If proposed indirect rates are considered to 
be unrealistic, the Offeror ’s proposed rates will be adjusted upward to 
determine the Government evaluated indirect rate .  No downward 
adjustment will be made to an Offeror ’s rates during the cost realism 
analysis . 
 If the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate represents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic .  
 RFP at 113  (§ M, 2.3.1.2). 
 The Navy argues that since both offerors proposed caps on all indirect costs, the Navy 
properly calculated each firm ’s costs by using the capped rates and deem ing the firm’s 
capped rates to be realistic .  The Navy maintains that the evaluation was consistent with 
the RFP, and that the evaluation of risk from PCCI ’s allegedly low indirect rates and 
ceilings, that Owl argues  for, was not required under the term s of the RFP .   
 As a general principle, the FAR provides that when evaluating offerors ’ costs for a 
cost-reimbursement contract, the agency must assess the realism of the offeror ’s 
proposed costs; that is, a cost realism analysis .  FAR 15 .404-1.  The requirement to 
assess cost realism is to recognize that the offeror ’s proposed costs are not dispositive 
in a cost -reimbursement environment ; that is, even if the offeror proposes that its costs 
will be low, the government generally will be liable to the contractor for all allowable and 
allocable costs incurred in connection with the performance of the contract .  Vectrus 
Mission Sols . Corp .; Vanquish Worldwide, LLC , B-418942 et al., Oct . 27, 2020, 2021 
CPD ¶ 87 at 5 .  The analysis involves   
 
independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror ’s 
proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials descri bed in the offeror ’s technical 
proposal . 
 FAR 15 .404-1(d)(1) .   
 Here, t he record does not show a basis to sustain Owl ’s challenges to the evaluation of 
PCCI ’s costs,  even if its proposal included indirect cost caps  that turn out to be far 
below the costs that PCCI will actually incur  during performance.   While a cost realism  Page 18   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 analysis may provide a basis to consider the risk posed by an offeror proposing cost 
caps that could create incentives for minimal or poor performance, the RFP here 
expressly provided that the Navy would consider proposed indirect cost caps to be 
realistic , hence, without regard to the cap level or the potential effects, such as an 
offeror ’s potential financial losses or distorted performance incentives .  Accordingly , the 
agency ’s treatment of PCCI’ s capped indirect rates as realistic (and likewise for Owl10) 
was consistent with the RFP .  Accordingly, we deny the protest er’s challenges to the 
evaluation under the cost/price factor .   
 Tradeoff  
 Finally, although Owl challenges the reasonableness of the Navy ’s tradeoff  and 
selection of PCCI ’s proposal, we do not reach the merits of these challenges because 
we conclude that without properly evaluating the offerors ’ professional compensation as 
the RFP provided, the Navy could not reasonably select PCCI ’s proposal as the best 
value.  Accordingly, we sustain the challenge to the agency’s tradeoff .   
 RECOMMENDATION  We recommend that the Navy reevaluate offerors ’ proposals in accordance with the 
RFP, and in particular FAR provision 52.222- 46.  If the Navy ’s evaluation reasonably 
determines that an offeror ’s professional compensation is unrealistically low , the Navy 
should consider whether the circumstances justify rejecting the proposal, pursuant to 
FAR provision 52.222- 46(d).   The Navy may consider reopening discussions if the Navy 
determines that obtaining more information would be in the agency’s interest.   We 
further recommend that the Navy make a new source selection determination and, if 
PCCI is not selected for award, we recommend that the agency terminate the award to PCCI for the convenience of the government and make a new award, if otherwise 
proper.  Finally, we recommend that the agency reimburse Owl’ s costs associated with 
filing and pursuing these protests, including reasonable attorneys ’ fees.  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.8(d)(1).  Owl should submit its certified claim for costs, detailing the time expended 
and costs incurred, directly to the contracting agency within 60 days after the receipt of 
this decision.   
 
The protest is sustained in part and denied in part .

protester’s prior protest  is denied where the agency reasonably limited the scope of 
discussions to address only the issues that led the agency to take corrective action. 
DECISION  
 The Mission Essential Group, LLC, of New Albany, Ohio, protests the scope of the agency’s corrective action following its prior protest of the award of a contract to Worldwide Language Resources, LLC (WWLR), of Fayetteville, North Carolina, under request for proposals (RFP) No. H92402- 23-R-0002, issued by the United States 
Special Operations Command for linguist support services.  The protester alleges that the agency’s proposed corrective action is both unreasonable and unfairly benefits WWLR.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 The RFP was initially issued on April 3, 2023, and contemplated the award of a single indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract with a 5- year ordering period.  Contracting 
Officer’s Statement (COS) at 2.  The solicitation included a preliminary fac tor--general 
administrative and qualifying criteria--to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP at 198.  Proposals that failed the initial factor were not DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-421745.4  evaluated further.  Id.  The solicitation then contemplated a best -value tradeoff among 
four additional factors:  (1) transition plan; (2) management plan; (3) past performance; 
and (4) price.  Id. 
 Five proposals were received by the original proposal due date in May of 2023.  COS at 3.  Four of those proposals received a pass rating for the preliminary factor, but 
ultimately only three proposals were selected for inclusion in the competitive range:  Mission Essential, WWLR, and SOS International LLC (SOSi).
1  Id. at 4.  The agency 
then issued evaluation notices (ENs) to all three remaining offerors and solicited final proposal revisions on February 9, 2024.  Id.   On May 10, the agency concluded that 
WWLR’s proposal represented the best value to the government and made award to WWLR.  Id.  Following a debriefing, Mission Essential filed a protest with our Office 
challenging the award to WWLR on several grounds, and subsequently filed a 
supplemental protest that included an allegation that WWLR’s management plan should 
have been assessed a deficiency because its small business subcontracting plan did not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  Id. at 5.  The agency elected to 
take corrective action committing to reevaluate proposals and take other corrective 
action as appropriate, and we dismissed the protest as academic.  AR, Tab 25, Notice 
of Corrective Action; The Mission Essential Group, LLC , B-421745.2, B -421745.3, Aug. 
19, 2024 (unpublished decision).  
 
Subsequently, the agency reevaluated proposals and issued a new set of ENs to each 
of the three offerors.  COS at 6 -7.  However, the agency limited the scope of proposal 
revisions to the scope of the issues identified in the ENs as well as any other portions of 
the proposal materially impacted by revisions necessary to address the ENs.  See , e.g., 
AR, Tab 32, Request for Final Proposal Revisions to Mission Essential at 1.  This 
protest followed.  
 
DISCUSSION  
The protester raises two primary  challenges to the scope of the agency’s corrective 
action.  Protest at 30- 37.  First, the protester alleges that the agency has improperly 
limited proposal revisions in a way that is impermissible, unequal, and unfair, primarily 
because the agency has limited offerors to revising only those portions of their 
proposals identified in t he ENs and the ENs  differ between offerors , thus allowing 
offerors unique opportunities to revise their respective proposals .  Id.  Second, the 
protester contends that the agency’s discussions with the protester were not meaningful 
 
1 Mission Essential was initially excluded from the competitive range due to concerns 
about its disclosure of certain changes to its corporate structure not at issue in this 
protest.  Mission Essential filed a protest of that exclusion with our Office, and the agency subsequently took voluntary corrective action to include Mission Essential in the competitive range.  The Mission Essential Group, LLC , B-421745, Sept. 7, 2023 
(unpublished decision).   Page 3 B-421745.4  because the agency failed to raise the significant price difference  between the protester 
and other offerors.2  Id. 
 
Turning to the protester’s first argument, the protester objects that the agency has limited proposal revisions to the evaluation notices issued to each offeror.  Comments 
at 5-10.  This is unfair, the protester contends, because each offeror’s potential 
revision s are limited differently.  Id.  That is, all offerors will be permitted to revise their 
price proposals, but each offeror is  limited to revising different aspects of their  
respective price proposal s based on the specific issues the agency identified in each 
evaluation notice.  Id.   Moreover, the protester notes that WWLR, and only WWLR, is 
being permitted to revise its management proposal, and the protester alleges that the nature of those changes could permit sweeping revisions to WWLR’s proposal.   Id. 
 Generally, in responding to discussions, offerors may revise any aspect of their proposals as they see fit --including aspects that were not the subject of discussions.  
Rel-Tek Sys. & Design, Inc. --Modification of Remedy , B-280463.7, July 1, 1999, 
99-2 CPD ¶ 1 at 3.   We have concluded, however, that  an agency, in conducting 
discussions to implement corrective action,  may reasonably decide to limit the revisions 
offerors may make to their proposals.   Id.  As a general matter, the details of 
implementing corr ective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the 
contracting agency, and we will not object to any particular corrective action, so long as it is appropriate to remedy the concern that caused the agency to take corrective 
 
2 The protester raises additional arguments not addressed in this decision.  W e have 
reviewed all of the protester’s  arguments and conclude that none of them provide a 
basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, the protester argues that the 
agency’s proposed corrective action violates the Federal Acquisition Regulation’s (FAR)  
requirement that all offerors have a common cutoff for submission of proposal revisions because offerors are being permitted to revise different proposal volumes , effectively 
creating different cutoff  dates  for final proposal submission for the revisions to those 
volumes.  Comments at 11- 12 (citing  FAR 15.307(b) ).  We do not agree.   
While the protester identifies a decision in which we concluded that an agency’s approach to proposal revisions during corrective action was inappropriate because it failed to create a common cutoff for proposal submission, that case is inapposite.  See  
Raytheon Tech. Servs. Co., LLC , B-404655.4 et al. , Oct. 11, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 236.  In 
Raytheon, the agency took corrective action that involved permitting two offerors that were originally excluded from the competitive range to enter the competitive range and submit revised proposals without limitation, but without permitting the original offerors in the competitive range the opportunity to further revise their proposals.  Id.  at 7-8.  As a 
result, different offerors had different periods of time for revising the entirety of their proposals and different cutoff dates for submission, which we concluded violated the FAR’s requirement for a common cutoff for final proposal revisions.  Id.  Those are not 
the facts present here--in this case, all offerors have been permitted to make proposal revisions and given a common cutoff date for submission.  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest on this basis.   Page 4 B-421745.4  action.   MSC Indus. Direct Co., Inc., B -411533.2, B -411533.4, Oct. 9, 2015, 2015 CPD 
¶ 316 at 5.    
 
Turning first to the price ENs,  while the protester is correct that the ENs  concerning 
price proposals differ between the offerors, we do not believe that the protester can establish competitive prejudice with regard to these ENs .  Competitive prejudice is an 
essential element of every viable protest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, 
Mar. 31, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 79 at 3.  Our Office will not sustain a protest unless the 
protester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the agency’s

 In this regard, the agency issued five price ENs, two to Mission Essential , two to 
WWLR, and one to SOSi .  Of note, each of the three offerors received one price EN 
asking for clarification concerning inconsistencies between their respective price workbook entries and transition plans addressing essentially similar proposal faults.  See, AR, Tabs 33, 37, and 41.  Because these three price ENs were similar in scope for 
all three offerors,  those ENs cannot represent a source of competitive prejudice.   
 Accordingly, the only potential avenue for competitive prejudice regarding the price ENs relates to the two remaining price ENs that differed between the offerors, one of which was issued to Mission Essential and the other to WWLR.  However,  as an initial matter, 
we have explained that although discussions may not be conducted in a manner that favors one offeror over another, discussions are not required to be identical among offerors and need only be tailored to each offeror’s proposal.  Second Street Hold ings, 
LLC et al. , B-417006.4 et al. , Jan. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 33 at 27.  Further, here we 
note that, while the protester is correct that the two ENs differ, the protester’s EN was 
significantly broader in scope than WWLR’s EN  potentially providing the protester with a 
greater opportunity than provided to other offerors to expand on its response to this EN . 
 Specifically, WWLR’s second price EN noted that WWLR’s subcontractors proposed a 
specific fringe rate that was lower than their historical rates .  The agency  asked WWLR 
to provide an explanation for how providing a fringe rate for each subcontractor lower than the firm’s historical fringe rates does not adversely impact each company’s ability 
to recruit and retain qualified personnel.  AR, Tab 42, WWLR Price EN R1 at 1.  That is, the agency asked for  additional explanatory narrative concerning WWLR’s existi ng 
subcontractor price and fringe rate narrative.  Id.  
 By contrast, the protester’s second price EN explained that none of the protester’s subcontractors provided a price narrative or explanation of fringe benefits  at all, and the 
EN asked the protester to provide price narratives including specific fringe benefit  
information for its subcontractors.  AR, Tab 34, Mission Essential Price EN R1 at 2.  Significantly, the protester’s EN is expansive enough that the protester could provide precisely the type of narrow revisions that WWLR is being permitted to make 
(justifications of its subcontractor fringe rates) in addition to other significant categories 
of revisions ( fully revising its absent subcontractor price narratives and fringe benefit 
explanations ).  Id.  That is, the protester’s EN is much broader in scope because it fully  Page 5 B-421745.4  encompasses the scope of WWLR’s EN and extends beyond it .  Moreover, we note that 
the third offeror, SOSi, was given no opportunity to amend this aspect of its price 
proposal.  Therefore, while the protester is correct that these ENs differ between the offerors, we see no reasonable basis to conclude that the protester was competitively prejudiced by these differences because the protester received the most expansive set of oppor tunities for revision of its price proposal among the three offerors.  
 Turning to the management plan EN  addressed to WWLR , we likewise see no basis to 
sustain the protest.  Here, the EN raised a concern that WWLR’s proposal was 
internally inconsistent in a way that represented a deficiency.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR 
Management EN D1 at 1- 2.  Specifically, the solicitation required that offerors allocate a 
minimum of 3 percent of contract dollars to woman- owned small businesses (WOSBs).  
RFP at 187.  However, while one table included in WWLR’s management plan indicated that WWLR  would allocate [DELETED]  percent of contract dollars to WOSBs, 
exceeding the minimum required subcontracting targets for WOSBs by [DELETED]  
percent, a second table indicated that WWLR would only allocate [DELETED]  percent to 
WOSBs, falling [DELETED]  percent short of the minimum subcontracting requirements.  
Compare AR, Tab 21g, WWLR Feb. 2024 Management Plan Volume at 37 (Figure 13 
showing [DELETED]  percent of contract value for WOSBs) with Id.  at 39 (Figure 14 
showing [DELETED]  percent of contract value for  WOSBs).  Moreover, the proposal 
was similarly inconsistent concerning the amount of contract dollars allocated to veteran- owned small businesses --for which the solicitation included no minimum target .  
Id.  Specifically, WWLR’s proposal  indicat ed that WWLR would allocate [DELETED]  
percent to veteran- owned small businesses in the first table but allocated [DELETED]  
percent in the second table.  Id.   The agency’s EN noted those discrepancies and 
permitted WWLR to revise its management plan to resolve the iss ue.  See  AR, Tab 40, 
WWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2. 
 Crucially, that identical inconsistency was present in WWLR’s initial proposal  submitted 
in May 12, 2023.  See  B-21745.2 AR, Tab 59s, WWLR May 2023 Management Plan 
Volume at 32 and 34.  However, t he agency did not identify this deficiency or raise it in 
discussions with WWLR.  A gencies are required to raise all deficiencies or significant 
weaknesses in discussions, and as a result, the agency’s discussions with WWLR were not meaningful because they did not raise this deficiency.   See , e.g., Mission Essential 
Personnel, LLC , B-407474, B -407493, Jan. 7, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 22 at 5 (discussions, 
when conducted, must be meaningful --that is, they must identify deficiencies and 
significant weaknesses that exist in an offeror’s proposal).  Moreover, we will sustain a 
protest when the record shows that, although an agency held discussions, it failed to raise a deficiency that was present in an offeror’s initial proposal .  Id.  Here, t he 
agency’s proposed corrective action to permit WWLR to resolve this deficiency is reasonable because it will correct the agency’s earlier error in failing to raise this point in discussions with WWLR.   
 Moreover, while the protester complains that it is not similarly allowed to revise its management plan, and the agency is, in effect, holding discussions with only WWLR concerning the management plan proposal volume, we likewise see no merit in that  Page 6 B-421745.4  objection.  In this regard, w e have specifically concluded that when reopening 
discussions during corrective action to address a fault in a proposal that the a gency 
improperly failed to raise in discussions, an agency may reasonably limit the scope of 
discussions and go so far as to hold discussions with only the affected 
offeror.   Environmental Chem. Corp. , B-416166.3 et al. , June 12, 2019, 2019 CPD 
¶ 217 at 20- 21 (corrective action proposing to hold discussions with only one offeror 
was reasonable where t he discussions and proposal revisions were limited solely to 
addressing a fault in offeror’s proposal that should have been raised in earlier discussions).    
 In this same vein, as explained above, the contours of agency corrective action are within its discretion provided the corrective action is designed to remedy the errors identified with a procurement.  Here, the parties do not dispute that the errors with the agency’s underlying evaluation necessitate reopening discussions.  Although the protester challenges the agency’s decision to tailor the scope of discussion responses and proposal revisions to match the areas of reopened discussions for each offeror, w e 
see no reason why the agency would be required to revisit those portions of the offerors proposals and its evaluation that were untainted by the underlying procurement errors.  An agency’s correction of procurement errors does not per se require the agency to 
embark on what would amount to an entirely new competition.  
 In short,  the agency was obligated to allow WWLR to revise this aspect of its 
management plan, and its approach is appropriate to resolve that concern.   In this 
regard, WWLR will only be placed in the same competitive position that the other offerors, including the protester, were in following their receipt of meaningful 
discussions.   The protester does not allege that its own management plan contains a 
similar unaddressed deficiency, and accordingly, we see no basis to conclude that the agency was under any obligation to permit other offerors to revise their management plans on these facts.

 Meaningful Discussions  
 Next the protester argues that the agency failed to engage in equal or meaningful discussions with the protester.  Comments at 12- 15.  Specifically, the protester argues 
that the agency went beyond the minimum requirements of the FAR by not limiting discus sions to deficiencies or significant weaknesses, but instead identified other 
aspects of the protester’s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance 
 
3 While it is not dispositive to our analysis, we also note that the nature of the issues 
raised by the management plan EN and WWLR’s proposed response were both relatively minor in scope.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2.  
Specifically, WWLR represented that this inconsistency was an administrative error and that it would amend the second table to move the additional [DELETED] percent from 
veteran owned small businesses to WOSBs so that the second table would match exactly what WWLR proposed in the first table in its management plan.  Id.   In essence, 
WWLR proposed to conform its proposal to correct what amounted to a clerical error.    Page 7 B-421745.4  materially  the protester’s potential for award.  Id.  However, the protester argues that the 
agency did not raise all such areas in the protester’s proposal, falsely leading the 
protester to believe that the agency had no concerns about areas that it did not raise.  Id.  Specifically, the protester notes that its price is approximately $50 million (or 
34 percent) higher than the next lowest -priced offeror, but the agency did not call that 
out in its initial discussions and has not now provided the protester  with an opportunity 
to revisit its price.  Id. 
 In response, the agency notes that during the corrective action reevaluation, the agency identified no deficiencies or significant weaknesses in the protester’s proposal, but did issue the price ENs discussed above to identify areas the protester could rev ise to 
improve its potential for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 18 -19.  The agency 
notes that the FAR encourages contracting officers to discuss other aspects of the offeror’s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance materially the 
propos al’s potential for award, but expressly notes that t he contracting officer is not 
required to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved.   Id. at 17.  
Accordingly, the agency  contends that these discussions are meaningful and not 
misleading, and exceeded the minimum requirements established by the FAR.  Id.  
at 19.   
 Discussions must, at a minimum, address significant weaknesses, deficiencies and 
adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond.  FAR 15.306(d)(3); American States Utilities Servs., Inc. , 
B-291307.3, June 30, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 150 at 6 .  Moreover, while issues pertaining to 
price are within the ambit of discussions these issues are treated distinctly from 
significant weaknesses and deficiencies in the non- price proposal.  See e.g. , FAR  
15.306(d) (discussions may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract) .  In this regard, contracting officers are 
specifically given the discretion, rather than charged with the obligation, to discuss 
whether an offeror’s price is considered to be too high or too low.  FAR 15.306(e)(3); 
see also Theodor Wille Intertrade AG , B-409976.3, Jan. 22, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 65 at 4 
(discussing the discretion given to contracting officers with respect to discussions related to price).   
 In short, on the facts present here, where the agency did not conclude that the protester’s price is unreasonably high and the agency has not otherwise raised comparative price with other offerors, our decisions are clear that a contracting officer is not obligated to raise the fact that an offeror’s price is higher than other offerors in 
discussions.   See, e.g., NOVA Dine, LLC , B-420454, B -420454.2, Apr. 15, 2022, 
2022 CPD ¶ 101 at 6 (“[T]here is no requirement for an agency to inform an offeror 
during dis cussions that its price may be too high, where the offeror’s price is not 
considered excessive or unreasonable”); SOC LLC,  B-419977,  B-419977.2, Oct. 15, 
2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 370 (notwithstanding the fact that the agency engaged in wide-ranging discussions and included several other discussion questions concerning price,   Page 8 B-421745.4  the agency was not required to raise the fact that the protester’s price was higher than 
other offerors’ prices because the protester’s price was not unreasonably high).  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest.

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging the scope of agency corrective action taken in response to the 
protester’s prior protest  is denied where the agency reasonably limited the scope of 
discussions to address only the issues that led the agency to take corrective action. 
DECISION  
 The Mission Essential Group, LLC, of New Albany, Ohio, protests the scope of the agency’s corrective action following its prior protest of the award of a contract to Worldwide Language Resources, LLC (WWLR), of Fayetteville, North Carolina, under request for proposals (RFP) No. H92402- 23-R-0002, issued by the United States 
Special Operations Command for linguist support services.  The protester alleges that the agency’s proposed corrective action is both unreasonable and unfairly benefits WWLR.  
 
We deny the protest.  
 
BACKGROUND  
 The RFP was initially issued on April 3, 2023, and contemplated the award of a single indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract with a 5- year ordering period.  Contracting 
Officer’s Statement (COS) at 2.  The solicitation included a preliminary fac tor--general 
administrative and qualifying criteria--to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP at 198.  Proposals that failed the initial factor were not DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-421745.4  evaluated further.  Id.  The solicitation then contemplated a best -value tradeoff among 
four additional factors:  (1) transition plan; (2) management plan; (3) past performance; 
and (4) price.  Id. 
 Five proposals were received by the original proposal due date in May of 2023.  COS at 3.  Four of those proposals received a pass rating for the preliminary factor, but 
ultimately only three proposals were selected for inclusion in the competitive range:  Mission Essential, WWLR, and SOS International LLC (SOSi).
1  Id. at 4.  The agency 
then issued evaluation notices (ENs) to all three remaining offerors and solicited final proposal revisions on February 9, 2024.  Id.   On May 10, the agency concluded that 
WWLR’s proposal represented the best value to the government and made award to WWLR.  Id.  Following a debriefing, Mission Essential filed a protest with our Office 
challenging the award to WWLR on several grounds, and subsequently filed a 
supplemental protest that included an allegation that WWLR’s management plan should 
have been assessed a deficiency because its small business subcontracting plan did not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  Id. at 5.  The agency elected to 
take corrective action committing to reevaluate proposals and take other corrective 
action as appropriate, and we dismissed the protest as academic.  AR, Tab 25, Notice 
of Corrective Action; The Mission Essential Group, LLC , B-421745.2, B -421745.3, Aug. 
19, 2024 (unpublished decision).  
 
Subsequently, the agency reevaluated proposals and issued a new set of ENs to each 
of the three offerors.  COS at 6 -7.  However, the agency limited the scope of proposal 
revisions to the scope of the issues identified in the ENs as well as any other portions of 
the proposal materially impacted by revisions necessary to address the ENs.  See , e.g., 
AR, Tab 32, Request for Final Proposal Revisions to Mission Essential at 1.  This 
protest followed.  
 
DISCUSSION  
The protester raises two primary  challenges to the scope of the agency’s corrective 
action.  Protest at 30- 37.  First, the protester alleges that the agency has improperly 
limited proposal revisions in a way that is impermissible, unequal, and unfair, primarily 
because the agency has limited offerors to revising only those portions of their 
proposals identified in t he ENs and the ENs  differ between offerors , thus allowing 
offerors unique opportunities to revise their respective proposals .  Id.  Second, the 
protester contends that the agency’s discussions with the protester were not meaningful 
 
1 Mission Essential was initially excluded from the competitive range due to concerns 
about its disclosure of certain changes to its corporate structure not at issue in this 
protest.  Mission Essential filed a protest of that exclusion with our Office, and the agency subsequently took voluntary corrective action to include Mission Essential in the competitive range.  The Mission Essential Group, LLC , B-421745, Sept. 7, 2023 
(unpublished decision).   Page 3 B-421745.4  because the agency failed to raise the significant price difference  between the protester 
and other offerors.2  Id. 
 
Turning to the protester’s first argument, the protester objects that the agency has limited proposal revisions to the evaluation notices issued to each offeror.  Comments 
at 5-10.  This is unfair, the protester contends, because each offeror’s potential 
revision s are limited differently.  Id.  That is, all offerors will be permitted to revise their 
price proposals, but each offeror is  limited to revising different aspects of their  
respective price proposal s based on the specific issues the agency identified in each 
evaluation notice.  Id.   Moreover, the protester notes that WWLR, and only WWLR, is 
being permitted to revise its management proposal, and the protester alleges that the nature of those changes could permit sweeping revisions to WWLR’s proposal.   Id. 
 Generally, in responding to discussions, offerors may revise any aspect of their proposals as they see fit --including aspects that were not the subject of discussions.  
Rel-Tek Sys. & Design, Inc. --Modification of Remedy , B-280463.7, July 1, 1999, 
99-2 CPD ¶ 1 at 3.   We have concluded, however, that  an agency, in conducting 
discussions to implement corrective action,  may reasonably decide to limit the revisions 
offerors may make to their proposals.   Id.  As a general matter, the details of 
implementing corr ective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the 
contracting agency, and we will not object to any particular corrective action, so long as it is appropriate to remedy the concern that caused the agency to take corrective 
 
2 The protester raises additional arguments not addressed in this decision.  W e have 
reviewed all of the protester’s  arguments and conclude that none of them provide a 
basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, the protester argues that the 
agency’s proposed corrective action violates the Federal Acquisition Regulation’s (FAR)  
requirement that all offerors have a common cutoff for submission of proposal revisions because offerors are being permitted to revise different proposal volumes , effectively 
creating different cutoff  dates  for final proposal submission for the revisions to those 
volumes.  Comments at 11- 12 (citing  FAR 15.307(b) ).  We do not agree.   
While the protester identifies a decision in which we concluded that an agency’s approach to proposal revisions during corrective action was inappropriate because it failed to create a common cutoff for proposal submission, that case is inapposite.  See  
Raytheon Tech. Servs. Co., LLC , B-404655.4 et al. , Oct. 11, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 236.  In 
Raytheon, the agency took corrective action that involved permitting two offerors that were originally excluded from the competitive range to enter the competitive range and submit revised proposals without limitation, but without permitting the original offerors in the competitive range the opportunity to further revise their proposals.  Id.  at 7-8.  As a 
result, different offerors had different periods of time for revising the entirety of their proposals and different cutoff dates for submission, which we concluded violated the FAR’s requirement for a common cutoff for final proposal revisions.  Id.  Those are not 
the facts present here--in this case, all offerors have been permitted to make proposal revisions and given a common cutoff date for submission.  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest on this basis.   Page 4 B-421745.4  action.   MSC Indus. Direct Co., Inc., B -411533.2, B -411533.4, Oct. 9, 2015, 2015 CPD

Turning first to the price ENs,  while the protester is correct that the ENs  concerning 
price proposals differ between the offerors, we do not believe that the protester can establish competitive prejudice with regard to these ENs .  Competitive prejudice is an 
essential element of every viable protest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, 
Mar. 31, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 79 at 3.  Our Office will not sustain a protest unless the 
protester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the agency’s  
actions. CSI Aviation, Inc. , B-415631 et al. , Feb. 7, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 68 at 7.    
 In this regard, the agency issued five price ENs, two to Mission Essential , two to 
WWLR, and one to SOSi .  Of note, each of the three offerors received one price EN 
asking for clarification concerning inconsistencies between their respective price workbook entries and transition plans addressing essentially similar proposal faults.  See, AR, Tabs 33, 37, and 41.  Because these three price ENs were similar in scope for 
all three offerors,  those ENs cannot represent a source of competitive prejudice.   
 Accordingly, the only potential avenue for competitive prejudice regarding the price ENs relates to the two remaining price ENs that differed between the offerors, one of which was issued to Mission Essential and the other to WWLR.  However,  as an initial matter, 
we have explained that although discussions may not be conducted in a manner that favors one offeror over another, discussions are not required to be identical among offerors and need only be tailored to each offeror’s proposal.  Second Street Hold ings, 
LLC et al. , B-417006.4 et al. , Jan. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 33 at 27.  Further, here we 
note that, while the protester is correct that the two ENs differ, the protester’s EN was 
significantly broader in scope than WWLR’s EN  potentially providing the protester with a 
greater opportunity than provided to other offerors to expand on its response to this EN . 
 Specifically, WWLR’s second price EN noted that WWLR’s subcontractors proposed a 
specific fringe rate that was lower than their historical rates .  The agency  asked WWLR 
to provide an explanation for how providing a fringe rate for each subcontractor lower than the firm’s historical fringe rates does not adversely impact each company’s ability 
to recruit and retain qualified personnel.  AR, Tab 42, WWLR Price EN R1 at 1.  That is, the agency asked for  additional explanatory narrative concerning WWLR’s existi ng 
subcontractor price and fringe rate narrative.  Id.  
 By contrast, the protester’s second price EN explained that none of the protester’s subcontractors provided a price narrative or explanation of fringe benefits  at all, and the 
EN asked the protester to provide price narratives including specific fringe benefit  
information for its subcontractors.  AR, Tab 34, Mission Essential Price EN R1 at 2.  Significantly, the protester’s EN is expansive enough that the protester could provide precisely the type of narrow revisions that WWLR is being permitted to make 
(justifications of its subcontractor fringe rates) in addition to other significant categories 
of revisions ( fully revising its absent subcontractor price narratives and fringe benefit 
explanations ).  Id.  That is, the protester’s EN is much broader in scope because it fully  Page 5 B-421745.4  encompasses the scope of WWLR’s EN and extends beyond it .  Moreover, we note that 
the third offeror, SOSi, was given no opportunity to amend this aspect of its price 
proposal.  Therefore, while the protester is correct that these ENs differ between the offerors, we see no reasonable basis to conclude that the protester was competitively prejudiced by these differences because the protester received the most expansive set of oppor tunities for revision of its price proposal among the three offerors.  
 Turning to the management plan EN  addressed to WWLR , we likewise see no basis to

3 While it is not dispositive to our analysis, we also note that the nature of the issues 
raised by the management plan EN and WWLR’s proposed response were both relatively minor in scope.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2.  
Specifically, WWLR represented that this inconsistency was an administrative error and that it would amend the second table to move the additional [DELETED] percent from 
veteran owned small businesses to WOSBs so that the second table would match exactly what WWLR proposed in the first table in its management plan.  Id.   In essence, 
WWLR proposed to conform its proposal to correct what amounted to a clerical error.    Page 7 B-421745.4  materially  the protester’s potential for award.  Id.  However, the protester argues that the 
agency did not raise all such areas in the protester’s proposal, falsely leading the 
protester to believe that the agency had no concerns about areas that it did not raise.  Id.  Specifically, the protester notes that its price is approximately $50 million (or 
34 percent) higher than the next lowest -priced offeror, but the agency did not call that 
out in its initial discussions and has not now provided the protester  with an opportunity 
to revisit its price.  Id. 
 In response, the agency notes that during the corrective action reevaluation, the agency identified no deficiencies or significant weaknesses in the protester’s proposal, but did issue the price ENs discussed above to identify areas the protester could rev ise to 
improve its potential for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 18 -19.  The agency 
notes that the FAR encourages contracting officers to discuss other aspects of the offeror’s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance materially the 
propos al’s potential for award, but expressly notes that t he contracting officer is not 
required to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved.   Id. at 17.  
Accordingly, the agency  contends that these discussions are meaningful and not 
misleading, and exceeded the minimum requirements established by the FAR.  Id.  
at 19.   
 Discussions must, at a minimum, address significant weaknesses, deficiencies and 
adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond.  FAR 15.306(d)(3); American States Utilities Servs., Inc. , 
B-291307.3, June 30, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 150 at 6 .  Moreover, while issues pertaining to 
price are within the ambit of discussions these issues are treated distinctly from 
significant weaknesses and deficiencies in the non- price proposal.  See e.g. , FAR  
15.306(d) (discussions may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract) .  In this regard, contracting officers are 
specifically given the discretion, rather than charged with the obligation, to discuss 
whether an offeror’s price is considered to be too high or too low.  FAR 15.306(e)(3); 
see also Theodor Wille Intertrade AG , B-409976.3, Jan. 22, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 65 at 4 
(discussing the discretion given to contracting officers with respect to discussions related to price).   
 In short, on the facts present here, where the agency did not conclude that the protester’s price is unreasonably high and the agency has not otherwise raised comparative price with other offerors, our decisions are clear that a contracting officer is not obligated to raise the fact that an offeror’s price is higher than other offerors in 
discussions.   See, e.g., NOVA Dine, LLC , B-420454, B -420454.2, Apr. 15, 2022, 
2022 CPD ¶ 101 at 6 (“[T]here is no requirement for an agency to inform an offeror 
during dis cussions that its price may be too high, where the offeror’s price is not 
considered excessive or unreasonable”); SOC LLC,  B-419977,  B-419977.2, Oct. 15, 
2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 370 (notwithstanding the fact that the agency engaged in wide-ranging discussions and included several other discussion questions concerning price,   Page 8 B-421745.4  the agency was not required to raise the fact that the protester’s price was higher than 
other offerors’ prices because the protester’s price was not unreasonably high).  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest.  
 The protest is denied.

B-423364,"April 28, 2025",SGL-HCI Joint Venture,"Protest is dismissed where matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of 
competent jurisdiction.  
DECISION  
 SGL-HCI Joint Venture (SHJV), a small,  disadvantaged business JV of Quantico, 
Virginia, protests the issuance of a basic ordering agreement (BOA) order to Red River Science and Technology , LLC  (RRST) , under request for proposals (RFP) 
No. W519TC -23-R-0088, issued by the Department of the Army for logistics support 
services.  The protester challenges the Army’s evaluation of SHJV’s past performance, 
asserting the evaluation had been “tainted”  by false negative information about SHJV’s 
performance on a prior BOA order .  Protest at 14.  
 We dismiss the protest  because the subject matter of the protest, specifically the Army’s 
evaluation and source selection decision under RFP No. W519TC -23-R-0088, currently 
is pending before a court of competent jurisdiction.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On July 19, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation part  15, the 
Army issued the solicitation to holders of the agency’s Enhanced Army  Global Logistics 
Enterprise (EAGLE) BOAs.  Protest exh. 1, RPF at 1- 2; Req. for Dismissal at 1.
1  The 
solicitation sought proposals for the provision of logistics support services , including 
maintenance, supply, and transportation support services, at Fort Knox, Kentucky.   RFP 
at 2.  The solicitation provided for issuance of a single hybrid order with both cost -plus-
fixed -fee and fixed- price elements  consisting of a 1- year base period and four 1- year

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2     B-423364   option periods.  Id .  The solicitation established that award would be made on a 
best-value basis, considering the following three evaluation factors:  (1) technical; 
(2) past performance; and (3) cost/price.  Id.  Specifically, the solicitation set forth that 
award would be made to the offeror “determined to be the lowest evaluated (fair and 
reasonable) priced proposal that is determined Technically Acceptable with Substantial Confidence in Past Performance.”  Id.   
 The Army received five timely proposals, including those submitted by the protester, SHJV, and the awardee, RRST.  Req. for Dismissal at 2.  In accordance with the award 
methodology specified in the solicitation, the source selection authority (SSA) “determined that R RST is the Offeror whose Technically Acceptable proposal 
represents the lowest Total Evaluated Price with a Substantial Confidence Past Performance Rating.”  Protest exh. 3, Source Selection Decision Document at 9.  The SSA found Red River’s pr ice fair and reasonable as well as realistic for the work to be 
performed and selected Red River’s proposal for award in the amount of 
$68,056,924.33.  Id.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of SHJV’s past performance.   
Pursuant to section 21.11 of our Bid Protest Regulations, the Army requests dismissal of SHJV’s protest because “the solicitation at issue in SHJV’s GAO protest is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.”  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   
The protester opposes dismissal .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  For the reasons 
explained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate here.  
 The Two Protests  
 The solicitation stated the agency would “ assess the contract references provided in the 
Offeror’s task order proposal to date, and other information available from sources other than those identified by the Offeror .”  RFP at 54.   The solicitation provided detailed 
instructions establishing the formatting and specifying the type of content to be included 
in offerors’ past performance references .  Id. generally at 41-45.  Relevant here, the 
solicitation specifically required offerors to “identify all recent contracts where it or its proposed JV Partners or Subcontractor experienced any performance problems that occurred within three years prior to the closing date of this  RFP, ” and to provide various 
information about the nature of the problems, including providing “copies of all Level III Corrective Action Reports (CARs).”   RFP at 44- 45.   
 The protester included six past performance references and past performance questionnaires (PPQs) in its proposal , one of which was for SHJV’s work on a prior 
EAGLE BOA order  at Aberdeen Providing Ground (APG), Maryland--contract order 
No. W519TC -23-G-0008/W519TC24F0081.  Protest at 12; Protest exh. 5A, SHJV Past 
Performance Proposal at 50.   The protest refers to this order as the “APG  Task Order”  
or “APG EAGLE Task Order.”  Protest at 12.   With regards to performance on that 
order, t he protester maintains:   Page 3     B-423364   Since the commencement of performance, SHJV has been met by APG 
EAGLE Task Order Senior Leadership with negative, if not resentful, and factually unsupported sentiments characterized by a two shop divide between ACC -RI and AMC
[2] regarding a historical preference for the 
incumbent Bowhead who did not win the award in what SHJV has 
described as suggestive “ole boys club” to DOD  [Department of D efense] 
investigators whereunder a clear CAR issuance proclivity preference 
would be the means of effecting APG’s clear intent to attempt to 
undermine SHJV’s performance capabilities through unwarranted, 
substantial non[ -]payments and issuance of unwarranted CARS to set 
forth a narrative under which APG could effect  an uncompleted sole 
source award to incumbent Bowhead and remove SHJV from APG EAGLE Task Order without any basis.  
 Id.  SHJV represents that these issues “are now under investigation of the DOD 
Inspector General and AMC Inspector General respectively for reprisal and abuse of authority (discretion).”  Id. at 14. 
 The protester argues  the agency’s consideration of the PPQ for the APG Task Order as 
part of the past performance evaluation “was unreasonably prejudicial because the APG PPQ was tainted by false information and was only one of six eligible past performance questionnaire submissions --5 of which, the Army’s debriefing reflects were determined 
to support a Substantial Confidence Rating.”   Protest at 14.  Additionally, the protester 
asserts the agency failed to consider information that was “too close at hand to ignore” regarding the ongoing inspector general investigations into the APG Task Order.  Id. 
at 17.  The protester contends that “[b]ut for the Army’s unreasonably prejudicial 
overweighting of the SHJV APG PPQ, [the] Army would have had a high expectation 
(i.e., Substantial Confidence) that SHJV would successfully perform,” which would have 
resulted in SHJV’s lower -priced, technically  acceptable proposal being selected for 
award.  Id.  at 14, 17- 18. 
 After SHJV filed its protest , the Army informed our Office  that “another unsuccessful 
offeror (i.e.  Gemini Tech Services, LLC) filed a protest at the U.S. Court of Federal 
Claims (COFC) involving the same solicitation at issue in SHJV’s GAO protest ,” and 
requested dismissal of SHJV’s protest.   Req. for Dismissal at 2.   At the COFC, Gemini 
challenges the agency’s evaluation and resulting decision to award to R RST under  the 
same solicitation (RFP No. W519TC -23-R-0088) .  Req. for Dismissal Tab 1, Redacted 
COFC Complaint at 2.   According to Gemini , had the Army  reasonably evaluated 
proposals, Gemini’s lower proposed price means  it would have had “ a substantial 
chance for award. ”  Id. at 3-4. 
 
 
2 ACC- RI is the U.S. Army Contracting Command--Rock Island, which is the office that 
issued the solicitation at issue in this protest.  Req. for Dismissal at 1; RFP at 1 .  AMC 
refers to the U.S. Army Materiel Command .  Page 4     B-423364   Court of Competent Jurisdiction  
 
Our regulations require the dismissal of any protest where the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction, or where the matter involved has been decided by the court.   4 C.F.R. § 21.11(b)  (“GAO will dismiss any case where 
the matter involved is the subject of litigation before, or has been decided on the merits by, a court of competent jurisdiction.”) .  Our decisions have explained consistently that , 
even where the issues before the court are not the same as those raised in our Office 
by a protester or are brought by a party other than the protester, we will not consider the protest if the court’s disposition of the matter could render a decision by our Office academic.   Blue Rose Consulting Group, Inc. , B-421229, Nov. 22, 2022, 2022 CPD

 Underpinning our policy of dismissing matters that currently are the subject of litigation 
before a court of competition jurisdiction is the prudential consideration that deference 
to a court’s resolution of similar protest issues obviates the risk of inconsistent 
resolution of such issues between forums.  Continental Serv. Group, Inc.; et al. , 
B-416443.3 et al. , Nov.  19, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶  393 at 7; see also Robinson Enters. --
Req. for Recon. , B-238594, Apr.  19, 1990, 90- 1 CPD ¶ 402 at 2 (affirming dismissal of 
protest challenging protester’s exclusion from competitive range where second disappointed offeror filed a protest in court challenging evaluation of proposals because potential relief our Office could grant in the dismissed protest --i.e. reevaluation of 
proposals --was virtually identical to the remedies that could be granted by the court).   
Relatedly , while not directly at issue here,  our policy of dismissing matters that  already  
have been decided on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is consistent with 
the doctrine of res judicata; that is, because a court’s determination is final and binding 
on the protester and the agency  “it would be pointless for” our Office to consider the 
merits of an already adjudicated protest issue.  Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-218241, June 18, 
1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 696 at 2.   
 The protester  opposes dismissal , arguing that  the Competition in Contracting Act 
(CICA) “both expressly and indirectly speaks to Congress’s intent that the GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Court over protests of the same procurement under the circumstances.”   Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2 .  In support of this argument, SHJV 
include s the following citations to CICA in its protest:  
 
31 U.S.C. [§] 3551(a) (“ [n]othing contained in this section shall be 
construed to give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over 
protests”); 31 U.S.C. [§] 3551(e) (“[a]n interested party adversely affected 
or aggrieved by the action or failure of a government agency to act with 
respect to a solicitation or award may obtain judicial review  thereof to 
the extent provided by section 702 through 706 of title 5 including 
determinations necessary to resolve disputed material facts or when 
otherwise appropriate.”)   Page 5     B-423364   Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2.   Relying on these citations, SHJV asserts that 
“Congress’s intent that GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction is clear,” and that it is 
“clearly appropriate for the GAO to exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with CICA’s 
Congressional delegation of authority where protests involve different factors, different plaintiffs, and where[,]  as here; the Gemini protest falls flat on its face.”  Id. 
 Further, SHJV  maintains  “that implementing regulations must constitutionally comport 
with Congressional statutory intent, not derivate, in lieu of a Congressional Act to the contrary.”  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2.  On this basis, SHJV asserts “[t]here is no 
constitutional basis for the GAO’s rule at 4 C.F.R. § 21.11 implementing Congress’s CICA in a manner departing from the CICA’s express jurisdictional grant to the GAO and the underlying intent of Congress that the GAO exercise bid protest j urisdict ion 
concurrently regardless of whether the same procurement is being protested in proceedings before the Court.”   Id.  Thus, according to the protester , because “CICA 
expressly provides the GAO with concurrent jurisdiction under the circumstances”  this 
means “SHJV’s protest cannot be dismissed.”  Id. 
 As an initial matter, we note that the sections of CICA --to which the protester purports to 
reference-- do not exist ; there is no section 3551(a) or section 3551(e) in title 31 of the 
United States Code.   Rather, section 3551 of title 31 is divided into numbered, not 
lettered, subparagraphs --e.g.,  3551(1) --that set out the definitions of the terms “protest,” 
“interested party,” and “Federal agency,” as used in CICA.   31 U.S.C. §§ 3551(1) -(3).  
Nor do any of the numbered subparagraphs of section 3551 include the language SHJV 
claims to quote from CICA.  Compare 31 U.S.C. § 3551 with  Resp. to Req. for 
Dismissal at 2.   Rather, with respect to the “ nonexclusivity of remedies ,” CICA simply 
provides : 
 
Nonexclusivity of remedies; matters included in agency record  This subchapter does not give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the United States Court  of Federal Claims . 
 31 U.S.C. § 3556.   
 Our Office has decided bid protests for decades  prior to CICA’s 1984 codification of our 
bid protest jurisdiction.
3  See e.g., Comptroller General McCarl to R.P. Brown, 
disbursing clerk, Department of Labor , A-25283, Dec. 13, 1928, 8 Comp. Gen. 299; 
Comptroller General McCarl to the Secretary of Commerce, A -12660, Jan. 28, 1926, 
5 Comp. Gen. 546.   Prior to the passage of CICA , it was the policy of our Office--as it 
remains now--not to hear protests  where the material issues presented were pending 
 
3 The provisions of CICA codifying our Office’s bid protest jurisdiction were enacted as 
part of the Deficit Reduction Act  of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98- 369, §  2741, 98 Stat.  
1199- 1203 (July 18, 1984) .  Page 6     B-423364   before a court of competent jurisdiction.  See e.g., Space Age Eng’g, Inc. , B-205594, 
Jan. 18, 1982, 82- 1 CPD ¶ 40 at  1 (dismissing protest  where protester filed both with 
our Office and with a court of competent jurisdiction on “substantially the same” bases , 
citing 4 C.F.R. § 21.10  (1981) ); A&J Produce, Inc.; D&D Poultry , B-203201.2, 
B-203201.3, Jan. 25, 1982, 82- 1 CPD ¶ 52 at 1 (dismissing protests where one of two 
protesters in our forum also filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in a court of 
competent jurisdiction, stating , “It is our policy not to decide protests where the material 
issues are before a court of competent jurisdiction unless the court requests, expects, or otherwise expresses an interest in our decision,” citing  4 C.F.R. § 21.10 (1981) ). 
 Shortly after CICA’s enactment, our Office had cause to consider whether CICA’s statutory provisions  impacted our policy  of not considering matters where the material 
issues are before a court of competent jurisdiction.  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon. , 
B-218188.2, June 27, 1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 733.  Lear Siegler had filed a protest with our 
Office challenging the Navy’s award of a contract  for aircraft fuel tanks .  Lear Siegler, 
Inc., B-218188, Apr.  8, 1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 403 at 1.  Concurrently, Lear Siegler  filed su it 
in the United States District Court  for the Central District of California , seeking injunctive 
and declaratory relief .  Id.  In this connection, the suit raised “ substantially the same 
issues raised”  in the protest before GAO .  Id.  The district court expressed an interest in 
our opinion on the matter  and, as a result, we issued what was, in effect, an advisory 
opinion, deny ing Lear Siegler’s protest.  Id.   Lear Siegler later requested reconsideration 
of our decision, and we dismissed the request pursuant to what was then section 21.9(a) of our regulations  (1985) , which is equivalent to section 21.11(b) of  our current 
regulations.  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1.   
 
Lear Siegler argued against dismissal, contending--similar to SHJV here--that our 
regulations did not require dismissal  because CICA “contemplates parallel judicial and 
administrative remedies.”  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1.  We disagreed.  Id.   In 
dismissing Lear Siegler’s request  for reconsideration, our Office  explained:  
 
Further, as reflected in our regulations, 4 C.F.R. § 21.9(a)  (1985), our 
policy of not considering protests where the issues presented are before a court of competent jurisdiction, and there has been no expression of interest for our opinion from the court, has remained unchanged under CICA.  See C&M Glass Co. , B-218227, Apr. 15, 1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 430; 
Grafton McClintock, Inc; BGM Corp., B -218549, Apr. 18, 1985, 85- 1 CPD 
¶ 448.  The reason for this policy is that the court’s determination on the 
merits will constitute a final adjudication and take precedence over a 
decision by our Office.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-218241, June 18, 1985, 
85-1 CPD ¶ 696.  Similarly, we see nothing in CICA requiring our Office to 
change its policy against considering requests for reconsideration in the 
absence of an expression of interest from the court to which our opinion 
was fur nished.  
 
Id. at 1-2.   Page 7     B-423364   The prudential considerations  underpinning our policy of not considering protests where 
the issues presented are before or have been decided by  a court of competent 
jurisdiction --i.e., avoiding inconsistent outcomes and honoring the principle of res 
judicata--are as firmly in place today as they were forty years ago when we decided 
Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon.   Nor have there been any statutory developments over the 
past forty years that have changed our view of CICA’s language vis- à-vis matters that 
are the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.  
 As discussed above,  the CICA provision  at issue states :  “This subchapter does not give 
the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the Uni ted States Court  of Federal Claims .”  
31 U.S.C. § 3556.  To interpret this language, “[w]e begin with the familiar canon of 
statutory construction that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of 
the statute itself.”  Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. , 447 U.S. 102, 
108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1980); KeyLogic Assocs., Inc.; KSD Techs., LLC, B-421346 et al. , Mar. 8, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 65 at 8.   In starting with the language 
of the statute, we give “the words used their ordinary meaning.”  Ingalls Shipbuilding, 
Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs , 519 U.S. 248, 255, 117 S. 
Ct. 796, 136 L.  Ed. 2d 736 (1997); KeyLogic Assocs., Inc.; KSD Techs., LLC, supra; 
Oracle America, Inc., B -416061, May 31, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 180 at 16.  If the statutory 
language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ends with the plain meaning.  Myore v. 
Nicholson , 489 F.3d 1207, 1211 (Fed. Cir. 2007); KeyLogic Assocs., Inc.; KSD Techs., 
LLC, supra at 8-9; .Oracle America, Inc., supra . 
 
Looking to the plain language of CICA,  we see that it refers not to “concurrent 
jurisdiction,” but to the “nonexclusivity of remedies”  in specifying  that our Office is not  
granted exclusive jurisdiction over protests.  31 U.S.C. § 3556.  T his language makes 
clear that protesters may choose to file their protests with  our forum or  with other  
designated  fora.  Contrary to the protester’s contentions, however, nothing in the plain 
language of CICA dictates that we retain jurisdiction over a protest  if a related matter is 
filed in another forum .  Rather, it is plain that CICA and our regulations “are designed to 
prevent protesters from maintaining the same action in separate forums .”  Systems 
Eng’g and Mgmt. Co. --Recon. , B-234047.4, Aug. 20, 1990, 90- 2 CPD ¶ 144 at  6.  
Further, even where the matter before a court of competent jurisdiction and our Office are not pr ecisely the same, it would be inappropriate for our Office to purport to take any 
action possibly limiting the potential relief to be granted by the court, as any eventual order from the court is binding on an agency , while decisions by our Office result in non-
binding recommendations to an agency .  Id.  Accordingly, we find nothing in the plain 
language of CICA to support the protester’s argument that we are required to exercise concurrent jurisdiction, or that we are barred from dismissing a protest under  section 
21.11(b) of our regulations.   See  Id.; Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1-2.    
  Page 8     B-423364   Effect of Judicial Proceedings  
 Beyond objecting to section 21.11 of our regulations generally, the protester also 
opposes dismissal  because, in SHJV’s view, Gemini’s protest before the COFC will not 
moot SHJV’s protest with our Office .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  According to 
SHJV, Gemini’s protest “will be dismissed or denied by the Court of Federal Claims 
because Gemini lacks standing.”  Id.  In SHJV’s  assessment , the “Army will as likely as 
not seek dismissal of Gemini’s protest at the Court for failure to state [a] claim, [or] lack 
of jurisdiction as Gemini is not an interested party, and/or will successfully defend against the same.”  Id.  The protester insists that “Gemini’s protest will be dismissed 
and/or denied,” and “therefore, the Gemini protest cannot and will not render [SHJV’s] protest along with possible, necessary outcomes academic.”  Id.    
 While SHJV claims to know how the court  will adjudicate Gemini’s protest, our Office 
has no basis --factual, legal, or otherwise--to reach such a conclusion.  Moreover, if 
dismissal of a protest in our forum were dependent on how our Office speculates or perceives a court will dispose of  a protest before it, such a result would vitiate the 
prudential considerations underlying the purpose of section 21.11.   Rather, in resolving 
the agency ’s request for dismissal, the standard we apply is whether a court’s 
consideration of an issue may  render a decision by our Office academic.  Continental 
Serv. Group, Inc.; et al., supra at 7 n.5.  As noted above, our decisions have explained 
that this is the appropriate standard because, as a prudential matter, deference to a court’s resolution of similar protest issues obviates the risk of an inconsistent resolution of such issues between forums.  Id. at 7; see also Robinson Enters. --Req. for Recon. , 
supra.   
 Here, both SHJV’s protest before our Office and Gemini’s protest before the COFC 
challenge aspects of the Army’s evaluation and source selection under the same solicitation, and notwithstanding SHJV’s insistence to the contrary, it is possible that the court  will adjudicate the merits of Gemini’s protest, find in Gemini’s favor, and order the 
Army to re -open the evaluation process, potentially leading to a new source selection

the COFC could render SHJV’s protest before our Office academic, dismissal is 
appropriate here.  Continental Serv. Group, Inc.; et al., supra at 7, 7 n.5; Robinson Enters. --Req. for Recon., supra; AECOM Mgmt. Servs., Inc.; et al., B -417506.2 et al. ,

 Furthermore, to the extent that the court ’s resolution of Gemini’s protest does not

 In the event, however, that the court proceedings do not result in a final adjudication on the merits or result in a narrow adjudication on the merits of only some issues, generally a protester whose initial protest was dismissed by our Office pursuant to section 21.11 of our regulations may file a new protest , reasserting its unaddressed prior protest

 CONCLUSION  
 In sum, as the matter involved in SHJV’s protest is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction, we find that dismissal is appropriate under section 21.11(b) of our regulations.  Further, we find that nothing in CICA acts to create a bar to such dismissal.  Finally, we note that this dismissal does not automatically preclude SHJV 
from filing a future protest with our Office , challenging the Army’s actions in connection

DIGEST  
 
Protest is dismissed where matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of 
competent jurisdiction.  
DECISION  
 SGL-HCI Joint Venture (SHJV), a small,  disadvantaged business JV of Quantico, 
Virginia, protests the issuance of a basic ordering agreement (BOA) order to Red River Science and Technology , LLC  (RRST) , under request for proposals (RFP) 
No. W519TC -23-R-0088, issued by the Department of the Army for logistics support 
services.  The protester challenges the Army’s evaluation of SHJV’s past performance, 
asserting the evaluation had been “tainted”  by false negative information about SHJV’s 
performance on a prior BOA order .  Protest at 14.  
 We dismiss the protest  because the subject matter of the protest, specifically the Army’s 
evaluation and source selection decision under RFP No. W519TC -23-R-0088, currently 
is pending before a court of competent jurisdiction.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On July 19, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation part  15, the 
Army issued the solicitation to holders of the agency’s Enhanced Army  Global Logistics 
Enterprise (EAGLE) BOAs.  Protest exh. 1, RPF at 1- 2; Req. for Dismissal at 1.
1  The 
solicitation sought proposals for the provision of logistics support services , including 
maintenance, supply, and transportation support services, at Fort Knox, Kentucky.   RFP 
at 2.  The solicitation provided for issuance of a single hybrid order with both cost -plus-
fixed -fee and fixed- price elements  consisting of a 1- year base period and four 1- year

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2     B-423364   option periods.  Id .  The solicitation established that award would be made on a 
best-value basis, considering the following three evaluation factors:  (1) technical; 
(2) past performance; and (3) cost/price.  Id.  Specifically, the solicitation set forth that 
award would be made to the offeror “determined to be the lowest evaluated (fair and 
reasonable) priced proposal that is determined Technically Acceptable with Substantial Confidence in Past Performance.”  Id.   
 The Army received five timely proposals, including those submitted by the protester, SHJV, and the awardee, RRST.  Req. for Dismissal at 2.  In accordance with the award 
methodology specified in the solicitation, the source selection authority (SSA) “determined that R RST is the Offeror whose Technically Acceptable proposal 
represents the lowest Total Evaluated Price with a Substantial Confidence Past Performance Rating.”  Protest exh. 3, Source Selection Decision Document at 9.  The SSA found Red River’s pr ice fair and reasonable as well as realistic for the work to be 
performed and selected Red River’s proposal for award in the amount of 
$68,056,924.33.  Id.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of SHJV’s past performance.   
Pursuant to section 21.11 of our Bid Protest Regulations, the Army requests dismissal of SHJV’s protest because “the solicitation at issue in SHJV’s GAO protest is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.”  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   
The protester opposes dismissal .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  For the reasons 
explained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate here.  
 The Two Protests  
 The solicitation stated the agency would “ assess the contract references provided in the 
Offeror’s task order proposal to date, and other information available from sources other than those identified by the Offeror .”  RFP at 54.   The solicitation provided detailed 
instructions establishing the formatting and specifying the type of content to be included 
in offerors’ past performance references .  Id. generally at 41-45.  Relevant here, the 
solicitation specifically required offerors to “identify all recent contracts where it or its proposed JV Partners or Subcontractor experienced any performance problems that occurred within three years prior to the closing date of this  RFP, ” and to provide various 
information about the nature of the problems, including providing “copies of all Level III Corrective Action Reports (CARs).”   RFP at 44- 45.   
 The protester included six past performance references and past performance questionnaires (PPQs) in its proposal , one of which was for SHJV’s work on a prior 
EAGLE BOA order  at Aberdeen Providing Ground (APG), Maryland--contract order 
No. W519TC -23-G-0008/W519TC24F0081.  Protest at 12; Protest exh. 5A, SHJV Past 
Performance Proposal at 50.   The protest refers to this order as the “APG  Task Order”  
or “APG EAGLE Task Order.”  Protest at 12.   With regards to performance on that 
order, t he protester maintains:   Page 3     B-423364   Since the commencement of performance, SHJV has been met by APG 
EAGLE Task Order Senior Leadership with negative, if not resentful, and factually unsupported sentiments characterized by a two shop divide between ACC -RI and AMC
[2] regarding a historical preference for the 
incumbent Bowhead who did not win the award in what SHJV has 
described as suggestive “ole boys club” to DOD  [Department of D efense] 
investigators whereunder a clear CAR issuance proclivity preference 
would be the means of effecting APG’s clear intent to attempt to 
undermine SHJV’s performance capabilities through unwarranted, 
substantial non[ -]payments and issuance of unwarranted CARS to set 
forth a narrative under which APG could effect  an uncompleted sole 
source award to incumbent Bowhead and remove SHJV from APG EAGLE Task Order without any basis.  
 Id.  SHJV represents that these issues “are now under investigation of the DOD 
Inspector General and AMC Inspector General respectively for reprisal and abuse of authority (discretion).”  Id. at 14. 
 The protester argues  the agency’s consideration of the PPQ for the APG Task Order as 
part of the past performance evaluation “was unreasonably prejudicial because the APG PPQ was tainted by false information and was only one of six eligible past performance questionnaire submissions --5 of which, the Army’s debriefing reflects were determined 
to support a Substantial Confidence Rating.”   Protest at 14.  Additionally, the protester 
asserts the agency failed to consider information that was “too close at hand to ignore” regarding the ongoing inspector general investigations into the APG Task Order.  Id. 
at 17.  The protester contends that “[b]ut for the Army’s unreasonably prejudicial 
overweighting of the SHJV APG PPQ, [the] Army would have had a high expectation 
(i.e., Substantial Confidence) that SHJV would successfully perform,” which would have 
resulted in SHJV’s lower -priced, technically  acceptable proposal being selected for 
award.  Id.  at 14, 17- 18. 
 After SHJV filed its protest , the Army informed our Office  that “another unsuccessful 
offeror (i.e.  Gemini Tech Services, LLC) filed a protest at the U.S. Court of Federal 
Claims (COFC) involving the same solicitation at issue in SHJV’s GAO protest ,” and 
requested dismissal of SHJV’s protest.   Req. for Dismissal at 2.   At the COFC, Gemini 
challenges the agency’s evaluation and resulting decision to award to R RST under  the 
same solicitation (RFP No. W519TC -23-R-0088) .  Req. for Dismissal Tab 1, Redacted 
COFC Complaint at 2.   According to Gemini , had the Army  reasonably evaluated 
proposals, Gemini’s lower proposed price means  it would have had “ a substantial 
chance for award. ”  Id. at 3-4. 
 
 
2 ACC- RI is the U.S. Army Contracting Command--Rock Island, which is the office that 
issued the solicitation at issue in this protest.  Req. for Dismissal at 1; RFP at 1 .  AMC 
refers to the U.S. Army Materiel Command .  Page 4     B-423364   Court of Competent Jurisdiction  
 
Our regulations require the dismissal of any protest where the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction, or where the matter involved has been decided by the court.   4 C.F.R. § 21.11(b)  (“GAO will dismiss any case where 
the matter involved is the subject of litigation before, or has been decided on the merits by, a court of competent jurisdiction.”) .  Our decisions have explained consistently that , 
even where the issues before the court are not the same as those raised in our Office 
by a protester or are brought by a party other than the protester, we will not consider the protest if the court’s disposition of the matter could render a decision by our Office academic.   Blue Rose Consulting Group, Inc. , B-421229, Nov. 22, 2022, 2022 CPD

 Underpinning our policy of dismissing matters that currently are the subject of litigation 
before a court of competition jurisdiction is the prudential consideration that deference 
to a court’s resolution of similar protest issues obviates the risk of inconsistent 
resolution of such issues between forums.  Continental Serv. Group, Inc.; et al. , 
B-416443.3 et al. , Nov.  19, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶  393 at 7; see also Robinson Enters. --
Req. for Recon. , B-238594, Apr.  19, 1990, 90- 1 CPD ¶ 402 at 2 (affirming dismissal of 
protest challenging protester’s exclusion from competitive range where second disappointed offeror filed a protest in court challenging evaluation of proposals because potential relief our Office could grant in the dismissed protest --i.e. reevaluation of 
proposals --was virtually identical to the remedies that could be granted by the court).   
Relatedly , while not directly at issue here,  our policy of dismissing matters that  already  
have been decided on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is consistent with 
the doctrine of res judicata; that is, because a court’s determination is final and binding 
on the protester and the agency  “it would be pointless for” our Office to consider the 
merits of an already adjudicated protest issue.  Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-218241, June 18, 
1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 696 at 2.   
 The protester  opposes dismissal , arguing that  the Competition in Contracting Act 
(CICA) “both expressly and indirectly speaks to Congress’s intent that the GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Court over protests of the same procurement under the circumstances.”   Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2 .  In support of this argument, SHJV 
include s the following citations to CICA in its protest:  
 
31 U.S.C. [§] 3551(a) (“ [n]othing contained in this section shall be 
construed to give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over 
protests”); 31 U.S.C. [§] 3551(e) (“[a]n interested party adversely affected 
or aggrieved by the action or failure of a government agency to act with 
respect to a solicitation or award may obtain judicial review  thereof to 
the extent provided by section 702 through 706 of title 5 including 
determinations necessary to resolve disputed material facts or when 
otherwise appropriate.”)   Page 5     B-423364   Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2.   Relying on these citations, SHJV asserts that 
“Congress’s intent that GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction is clear,” and that it is 
“clearly appropriate for the GAO to exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with CICA’s 
Congressional delegation of authority where protests involve different factors, different plaintiffs, and where[,]  as here; the Gemini protest falls flat on its face.”  Id. 
 Further, SHJV  maintains  “that implementing regulations must constitutionally comport 
with Congressional statutory intent, not derivate, in lieu of a Congressional Act to the contrary.”  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2.  On this basis, SHJV asserts “[t]here is no 
constitutional basis for the GAO’s rule at 4 C.F.R. § 21.11 implementing Congress’s CICA in a manner departing from the CICA’s express jurisdictional grant to the GAO and the underlying intent of Congress that the GAO exercise bid protest j urisdict ion 
concurrently regardless of whether the same procurement is being protested in proceedings before the Court.”   Id.  Thus, according to the protester , because “CICA 
expressly provides the GAO with concurrent jurisdiction under the circumstances”  this 
means “SHJV’s protest cannot be dismissed.”  Id. 
 As an initial matter, we note that the sections of CICA --to which the protester purports to 
reference-- do not exist ; there is no section 3551(a) or section 3551(e) in title 31 of the 
United States Code.   Rather, section 3551 of title 31 is divided into numbered, not 
lettered, subparagraphs --e.g.,  3551(1) --that set out the definitions of the terms “protest,” 
“interested party,” and “Federal agency,” as used in CICA.   31 U.S.C. §§ 3551(1) -(3).  
Nor do any of the numbered subparagraphs of section 3551 include the language SHJV 
claims to quote from CICA.  Compare 31 U.S.C. § 3551 with  Resp. to Req. for 
Dismissal at 2.   Rather, with respect to the “ nonexclusivity of remedies ,” CICA simply 
provides : 
 
Nonexclusivity of remedies; matters included in agency record  This subchapter does not give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the United States Court  of Federal Claims . 
 31 U.S.C. § 3556.   
 Our Office has decided bid protests for decades  prior to CICA’s 1984 codification of our 
bid protest jurisdiction.
3  See e.g., Comptroller General McCarl to R.P. Brown, 
disbursing clerk, Department of Labor , A-25283, Dec. 13, 1928, 8 Comp. Gen. 299; 
Comptroller General McCarl to the Secretary of Commerce, A -12660, Jan. 28, 1926, 
5 Comp. Gen. 546.   Prior to the passage of CICA , it was the policy of our Office--as it 
remains now--not to hear protests  where the material issues presented were pending 
 
3 The provisions of CICA codifying our Office’s bid protest jurisdiction were enacted as 
part of the Deficit Reduction Act  of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98- 369, §  2741, 98 Stat.  
1199- 1203 (July 18, 1984) .  Page 6     B-423364   before a court of competent jurisdiction.  See e.g., Space Age Eng’g, Inc. , B-205594, 
Jan. 18, 1982, 82- 1 CPD ¶ 40 at  1 (dismissing protest  where protester filed both with 
our Office and with a court of competent jurisdiction on “substantially the same” bases , 
citing 4 C.F.R. § 21.10  (1981) ); A&J Produce, Inc.; D&D Poultry , B-203201.2,

protesters in our forum also filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in a court of 
competent jurisdiction, stating , “It is our policy not to decide protests where the material 
issues are before a court of competent jurisdiction unless the court requests, expects, or otherwise expresses an interest in our decision,” citing  4 C.F.R. § 21.10 (1981) ). 
 Shortly after CICA’s enactment, our Office had cause to consider whether CICA’s statutory provisions  impacted our policy  of not considering matters where the material 
issues are before a court of competent jurisdiction.  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon. , 
B-218188.2, June 27, 1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 733.  Lear Siegler had filed a protest with our 
Office challenging the Navy’s award of a contract  for aircraft fuel tanks .  Lear Siegler, 
Inc., B-218188, Apr.  8, 1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 403 at 1.  Concurrently, Lear Siegler  filed su it 
in the United States District Court  for the Central District of California , seeking injunctive 
and declaratory relief .  Id.  In this connection, the suit raised “ substantially the same 
issues raised”  in the protest before GAO .  Id.  The district court expressed an interest in 
our opinion on the matter  and, as a result, we issued what was, in effect, an advisory 
opinion, deny ing Lear Siegler’s protest.  Id.   Lear Siegler later requested reconsideration 
of our decision, and we dismissed the request pursuant to what was then section 21.9(a) of our regulations  (1985) , which is equivalent to section 21.11(b) of  our current 
regulations.  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1.   
 
Lear Siegler argued against dismissal, contending--similar to SHJV here--that our 
regulations did not require dismissal  because CICA “contemplates parallel judicial and 
administrative remedies.”  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1.  We disagreed.  Id.   In 
dismissing Lear Siegler’s request  for reconsideration, our Office  explained:  
 
Further, as reflected in our regulations, 4 C.F.R. § 21.9(a)  (1985), our 
policy of not considering protests where the issues presented are before a court of competent jurisdiction, and there has been no expression of interest for our opinion from the court, has remained unchanged under CICA.  See C&M Glass Co. , B-218227, Apr. 15, 1985, 85- 1 CPD ¶ 430; 
Grafton McClintock, Inc; BGM Corp., B -218549, Apr. 18, 1985, 85- 1 CPD 
¶ 448.  The reason for this policy is that the court’s determination on the 
merits will constitute a final adjudication and take precedence over a 
decision by our Office.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-218241, June 18, 1985, 
85-1 CPD ¶ 696.  Similarly, we see nothing in CICA requiring our Office to 
change its policy against considering requests for reconsideration in the 
absence of an expression of interest from the court to which our opinion 
was fur nished.  
 
Id. at 1-2.   Page 7     B-423364   The prudential considerations  underpinning our policy of not considering protests where 
the issues presented are before or have been decided by  a court of competent 
jurisdiction --i.e., avoiding inconsistent outcomes and honoring the principle of res 
judicata--are as firmly in place today as they were forty years ago when we decided 
Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon.   Nor have there been any statutory developments over the 
past forty years that have changed our view of CICA’s language vis- à-vis matters that 
are the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.  
 As discussed above,  the CICA provision  at issue states :  “This subchapter does not give 
the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the Uni ted States Court  of Federal Claims .”  
31 U.S.C. § 3556.  To interpret this language, “[w]e begin with the familiar canon of 
statutory construction that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of 
the statute itself.”  Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. , 447 U.S. 102, 
108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1980); KeyLogic Assocs., Inc.; KSD Techs., LLC, B-421346 et al. , Mar. 8, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 65 at 8.   In starting with the language 
of the statute, we give “the words used their ordinary meaning.”  Ingalls Shipbuilding, 
Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs , 519 U.S. 248, 255, 117 S. 
Ct. 796, 136 L.  Ed. 2d 736 (1997); KeyLogic Assocs., Inc.; KSD Techs., LLC, supra; 
Oracle America, Inc., B -416061, May 31, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 180 at 16.  If the statutory 
language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ends with the plain meaning.  Myore v. 
Nicholson , 489 F.3d 1207, 1211 (Fed. Cir. 2007); KeyLogic Assocs., Inc.; KSD Techs., 
LLC, supra at 8-9; .Oracle America, Inc., supra . 
 
Looking to the plain language of CICA,  we see that it refers not to “concurrent 
jurisdiction,” but to the “nonexclusivity of remedies”  in specifying  that our Office is not  
granted exclusive jurisdiction over protests.  31 U.S.C. § 3556.  T his language makes 
clear that protesters may choose to file their protests with  our forum or  with other  
designated  fora.  Contrary to the protester’s contentions, however, nothing in the plain 
language of CICA dictates that we retain jurisdiction over a protest  if a related matter is 
filed in another forum .  Rather, it is plain that CICA and our regulations “are designed to 
prevent protesters from maintaining the same action in separate forums .”  Systems 
Eng’g and Mgmt. Co. --Recon. , B-234047.4, Aug. 20, 1990, 90- 2 CPD ¶ 144 at  6.  
Further, even where the matter before a court of competent jurisdiction and our Office are not pr ecisely the same, it would be inappropriate for our Office to purport to take any 
action possibly limiting the potential relief to be granted by the court, as any eventual order from the court is binding on an agency , while decisions by our Office result in non-
binding recommendations to an agency .  Id.  Accordingly, we find nothing in the plain 
language of CICA to support the protester’s argument that we are required to exercise concurrent jurisdiction, or that we are barred from dismissing a protest under  section 
21.11(b) of our regulations.   See  Id.; Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1-2.    
  Page 8     B-423364   Effect of Judicial Proceedings  
 Beyond objecting to section 21.11 of our regulations generally, the protester also 
opposes dismissal  because, in SHJV’s view, Gemini’s protest before the COFC will not 
moot SHJV’s protest with our Office .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  According to 
SHJV, Gemini’s protest “will be dismissed or denied by the Court of Federal Claims 
because Gemini lacks standing.”  Id.  In SHJV’s  assessment , the “Army will as likely as 
not seek dismissal of Gemini’s protest at the Court for failure to state [a] claim, [or] lack 
of jurisdiction as Gemini is not an interested party, and/or will successfully defend against the same.”  Id.  The protester insists that “Gemini’s protest will be dismissed 
and/or denied,” and “therefore, the Gemini protest cannot and will not render [SHJV’s] protest along with possible, necessary outcomes academic.”  Id.    
 While SHJV claims to know how the court  will adjudicate Gemini’s protest, our Office 
has no basis --factual, legal, or otherwise--to reach such a conclusion.  Moreover, if 
dismissal of a protest in our forum were dependent on how our Office speculates or perceives a court will dispose of  a protest before it, such a result would vitiate the 
prudential considerations underlying the purpose of section 21.11.   Rather, in resolving 
the agency ’s request for dismissal, the standard we apply is whether a court’s 
consideration of an issue may  render a decision by our Office academic.  Continental 
Serv. Group, Inc.; et al., supra at 7 n.5.  As noted above, our decisions have explained 
that this is the appropriate standard because, as a prudential matter, deference to a court’s resolution of similar protest issues obviates the risk of an inconsistent resolution of such issues between forums.  Id. at 7; see also Robinson Enters. --Req. for Recon. , 
supra.   
 Here, both SHJV’s protest before our Office and Gemini’s protest before the COFC

Army to re -open the evaluation process, potentially leading to a new source selection 
decision.  Accordingly , because it is possible that the adjudication of Gemini’s protest by 
the COFC could render SHJV’s protest before our Office academic, dismissal is 
appropriate here.  Continental Serv. Group, Inc.; et al., supra at 7, 7 n.5; Robinson Enters. --Req. for Recon., supra; AECOM Mgmt. Servs., Inc.; et al., B -417506.2 et al. ,

 In the event, however, that the court proceedings do not result in a final adjudication on the merits or result in a narrow adjudication on the merits of only some issues, generally a protester whose initial protest was dismissed by our Office pursuant to section 21.11 of our regulations may file a new protest , reasserting its unaddressed prior protest 
grounds.  See e.g., Res Rei Dev., Inc. , B-410466.7, Oct. 16, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 320

 CONCLUSION  
 In sum, as the matter involved in SHJV’s protest is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction, we find that dismissal is appropriate under section 21.11(b) of our regulations.  Further, we find that nothing in CICA acts to create a bar to such dismissal.  Finally, we note that this dismissal does not automatically preclude SHJV 
from filing a future protest with our Office , challenging the Army’s actions in connection 
with RFP No.  W519TC -23-R-0088, provided such future protest is fil ed in accordance 
with our regulations.

Engineers, for m iscellaneous design-b uild civil works construction projects throughout 
the Memphis District area of responsibility.

1 The Memphis District encompasses six states:  Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, 
Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.  RFP at 110.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423394  BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the RFP on May 9, 2024, using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 procedures, with the competition set aside for small businesses.  Contracting Officer Statement (COS) at 1.  The RFP contemplated the award of one or more indefini te-delivery, indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) contracts
2 with fixed -price task orders 
and a period of performance consisting of a 12- month based period and four additional 
12-month ordering periods.  RFP at 19, 22.3  The RFP stated that the procurement 
would be conducted in two phases, and up to 10 of the most highly qualified offerors would be invited to submit phase two proposals following the phase one evaluation.  Id.  
at 23.  
 The RFP stated that phase one proposals would be evaluated under the following three technical f actor s, listed in descending order of importance:  past performance; 
construction execution approach; and organization management team.  Id. at 24.  Past 
performance was to be evaluated to assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of the performance and assigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, limited, or no confidence.
4  Id. at 34 -35.  The remaining technical 
factors would be evaluated and assigned one of the following adjectival ratings:  outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 35.  The RFP stated:   
 
Any proposal that receives less than an “Acceptable” rating in a technical factor or less than a “Satisfactory Confidence” past performance rating will be ineligible for award and will not participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  Based upon the ratings, the Government will select the most 
highly rated Offerors to participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  
 
Id. at 34.  
 The agency evaluated 21 phase one proposals received in response to the solicitation, including a proposal from RKE.  AR, Tab 13, Down- Select Decision Document at 4- 5.  
RKE received a past performance rating of s atisfactory confidence with a relevancy 
rating of somewhat relevant .  Id. at 5.  RKE was rated as marginal under the 
construction execution approach factor, and acceptable under the organization 
 
2 Elsewhere, the RFP identified “a target of up to [five IDIQ contracts] awarded to Small 
Businesses.”  Agency Report (AR), Tab 4, RFP at 23.  
3 The RFP was amended four times.  Citations to the RFP in this decision are to the 
final conformed RFP provided by the agency as tab 4.  Additionally, all page citations in this decision are to Adobe Acrobat PDF page numbers.  
4 The RFP defined recent as “completed, or currently in progress with at least 50 
[percent] construction completed, within the past ten (10) years as of the date the solicitation was issued.”  RFP at 29.  Additionally, relevancy would be assessed for scope,  magnitude of effort, and complexity, and assigned the following ratings:  very 
relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant.  Id.  at 34.   Page 3 B-423394  management team factor.  Id.  The source selection authority (SSA) concurred with all 
the evaluation findings.  Because of its marginal rating under the construction execution 
factor, RKE’s proposal  was not included amongst the ten most highly qualified 
proposals  invited to phase two.  Id. at 5, 17.   
 On March 10, 2025, RKE received a debriefing that explained the agency’s rationale for 
the elimination of its proposal from phase two of the procurement.  AR, Tab 14, RKE Debriefing.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably and irrationally eliminated RKE from phase two of the competition.  According to the protester, the ratings assigned by the agency are unreasonable given RKE’s capabilities and the information provided in i ts 
proposal.  Protest at 1.  The protester challenges its evaluation under each of the phase one evaluation factors, including the ratings assigned and all weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and a deficiency identified by the evaluators.  Id. at 10- 33. 
 At the outset, we note that in reviewing protests challenging the evaluation of an offeror’s proposal, it is not our role to reevaluate proposals; rather, our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency’s judgment was reasonable, and in acco rdance with applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Patriot Def. Grp., 
LLC, B-418720.3, Aug. 5, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 265 at 7.  A protester’s disagreement with 
the agency’s evaluation, without more, does not establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  A -P-T Research, Inc. , B-414825, B -414825.2, Sept. 27, 2017, 2017 
CPD ¶ 337 at 4.  
 For the reasons explained below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  We find that the agency reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to the protester’s proposal under the construction execution approach factor and that, as a result, the protester cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with regard to its remaining challenges.  While our decision does not address every variation of every argument raised by the protester, our Office has considered them all and find none afford a basis on whic h to 
sustain the protest.  
 Evaluation of RKE’s Construction Execution Approach  
 The protester argues that its proposal addressed all the minimum requirements to be rated acceptable rather than marginal under the construction execution approach factor, and the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Protest at 15- 16.  Specificall y, the 
protester challenges a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the agency, arguing the evaluation findings were flawed because the RFP did not require the level of detail the agency evaluated as missing from RKE’s  proposal.  
Alternatively, the protester argues that the agency failed to fully consider the information that RKE provided in its proposal.  Id.  at 15- 27. 
  Page 4 B-423394  The agency argues that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the 
evaluation criteria, and that it properly rated RKE’s proposal as marginal and deemed it ineligible for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 4.  In particular, the agency 
argues t hat the RFP emphasized the importance of experience performing 
preconstruction services , which RKE’s proposal failed to address, and that all the 
challenged findings validly stemmed from a common issue--a severe lack of detail in 
RKE’s  proposal . 
 Id. at 4-10.  We agree with the agency.  
 As relevant to the protester’s arguments, regarding construction execution approach, section 6.1.1 of the RFP required that offerors provide a narrative approach to address 
the following eight challenges : 
 a) Understanding of the process to adequately address and anticipate both the benefits  and risks associated with Design- Build projects for U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers  or other [Department of Defense]  component.  
 b) Discussion on the utilization of alternative delivery methods and preconstruction services as identified in paragraph 5.2.2 to include a comparison of differences between the public and private sector constraints.
[5] 
 c) Sourcing and management of major materials (e.g., borrow material, steel, concrete, etc.) and mitigation of major supply chain issues.  
 d) Obtaining access to work locations.  
 e) Coordination with local property owners and stakeholders.  
 f) Compliance with contractual, administrative, and other requirements.  
 g) Hiring qualified laborers and maintaining a qualified workforce.  
 h) Coordination with multiple contractors on site.  
 RFP at 30- 31.  The RFP limited narrative responses to 10 pages.  Id.   Section 6.1.2 of 
the RFP stated the agency would evaluate the narrative response provided in the proposal as follows:    
a) Offerors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable.  
 
 
5 Paragraph 5.2.2 of the RFP referred to a number of different preconstruction services, 
including cost estimation, evaluation of design documents for constructability, recommendations on construction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other  things.  RFP at 29.   Page 5 B-423394  b) Evidence of understanding and mitigating the construction execution 
challenges specific to Civil Works Program through traditional Design- Bid-
Build and Design- Build processes may be considered a strength.  
 c) Offerors should demonstrate understanding and experience in the execution of preconstruction services.  An acceptable discussion would identify experience performing preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project success, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the owner and/or stakeholders.  
 d) Approaches that provided innovative means and/or methods for operating in unforeseen conditions including, but not limited to, emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, real estate coordination, restricted access, supply chain demands, on site coordination, environmental compliance issues, and long lead  
item procurement process may be considered a strength.  
 Id. at 31.  The RFP stated that the narratives should substantiate the offeror’s 
construction approach by relating technical solutions and project execution challenges, and that the government would evaluate “the offeror’s technical approach on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its relevance to the work” required by the RFP.  Id.  
 The evaluators identified the following deficiency in RKE’s proposal under the construction execution approach factor:  “ Instead of listing how the work would be 
achieved, the Offeror repeated what was in the RFP as a response to Section 6.1.1.  
The SSEB [Source Selection Evaluation Board] noted that the offeror’s proposal 
occasionally reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the solicitation and does not provide adequate details to demonstrate understanding of the requirements. ”  AR, Tab 11, Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  This deficiency 
was in addition to three significant weaknesses and four weaknesses, each of which to varying degrees identify RKE’s failure to discuss or adequately detail its approach to various aspects of the requirement.  For example, one significant weakness stated:  “The importance and usage of preconstruction services (as specified in Section 6.1.2.C) is not discussed within this proposal.”  Id.    
 The evaluators provided the following rationale for assigning a marginal rating:  
 
Overall, the construction execution approach proposed by [RKE] does not demonstrate an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is high. . . .  [RKE] does not demonstrate that they have a thorough approa ch to construction 
execution.  The information provided does not provide sufficient detail when describing their experience or knowledge of design- build and the 
important elements necessary for success as listed in this solicitation.  [RFP] Section 6.1.2.C  states that the offeror should demonstrate  Page 6 B-423394  understanding and experience in execution of preconstruction services.  
The application of preconstruction services is one of the main benefits of the Design- Build process and the proposal “has not demonstrated an 
adequate understanding of the requirements ” by leaving out 
preconstruction services. . . .  The proposal indicates a marginal approach and understanding of the requirements of the solicitation such that the SSEB is confident that the risk of unsuccessful performance is high.  
 Id.  The agency argues that the evaluators reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to 
RKE’s construction execution approach, and in accordance with the RFP its proposal 
was properly deemed ineligible for award.  MOL at 3 -4. The agency explains that the 
protester’s proposal did not include an adequate discussion of preconstruction services, including cost estimating, evaluation of design documents for constructability, identification of construction related problems or errors in design, recommendations on cons truction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other things required by 
the solicitation.  Id.  at 5. 
 In a negotiated procurement, it is an offeror’s responsibility to submit a well -written 
proposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Probity, 
Inc., B-420210, Dec. 21, 2021, 2023 CPD ¶ 38 at 3.  If a proposal omits, inadequately 
addresses, or fails to clearly convey required information, the offeror runs the risk of an adverse agency evaluation.  See Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc. , B-418375.2,  May 28, 
2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 207 at 4.  
 
On this record, we find that the protester has not demonstrated that the agency’s 
evaluation was flawed.  The protester argues that its proposal did indeed address 
preconstruction services, along with the utilization of alternate delivery methods, as requi red by the RFP.  Protest at 21- 22 (citing AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal  
at 69- 70).  In support of its position, RKE points to the following paragraph of its 
proposal under the heading “ Construction Manager as Constructor (CMC) and 
Construction Manager at Risk ( CMAR) ,” which states as follows:  
 
A defining characteristic of a Construction Manager  [as Constructor]  
(CMC) contract (of any type) is the timing of their  involvement in the 
project.  In the traditional Design- Bid-Build delivery method, the 
construction entity is  not involved until the “Bid” portion of the project. 
Design occurs without the involvement of a  construction entity.   When a 
construction manager is involved by contract, they are involved in “preconstruction”  activities.  Therefore, during design, they can be 
contracted to offer s chedule, budget, and constructability input or 
feedback to the owner.  This early involvement can be beneficial if the owner and/or design firm do not have strong construction experience to draw upon internally.  
 AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal at 69 (emphasis added).    Page 7 B-423394   
The paragraph quoted above, however, is the only place with any mention of preconstruction, and the protester has not cited to any other portion of its proposal to demonstrate that it provided “[a] n acceptable discussion [identify ing] experience 
performing preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project 
success, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the 
owner and/or stakeholders ,” as required by the RFP.  See  RFP at 31.  Instead, the 
remaining three paragraphs in this section of the proposal provide a general discussion of the relationships under a CMC and CMAR approach but fail to provide specific experience with a project in which RKE performed preconstruction services, their influence on the succ ess of the project, or how the services mitigated risks and provided 
benefits to owners of and stakeholders of the project.  See generally  AR, Tab 9, RKE 
Proposal at 69- 70.  We also note RKE’s proposal provided less than four full pages of 
narrative response, less than half of the 10 pages the RFP permitted for offerors to explain their construction execution approach.  Id. at 68 -71. 
 After review of the agency report, RKE cites to additional sections of its proposal and argues that in addition to addressing preconstruction services generally, its proposal also addressed the preconstruction services of cost estimating, constructability,  
identification of construction- related problems, and value engineering.
6  See  Comments 
at 3-6.  The protester argues that “[a]t best, [the agency] can suggest that that portion of 
the proposal focused too heavily on alternative delivery methods to the detriment of preconstruction services . . . and fails to understand the relations hip between alternative 
delivery methods and preconstruction services.”  Id. at 4.  However, as noted above, 
while the RFP required offerors to address their utilization of alternative delivery 
methods and preconstruction services, the evaluation criteria emphasized that offerors 
should “demonstrate understanding and experience in  the execution of preconstruction 
services.”  RFP at 31.  RKE failed to heed this directive at the risk of an unfavorable evaluation.  Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc., supra.  Moreov er, the language from RKE’s 
proposal that it cites as examples of where it addressed preconstruction services provides limited detail and instead often simply restates solicitation requirements, which is why the agency assessed the deficiency under this factor.  
 To the extent the protester now seeks to more clearly articulate the information provided in its proposal to address preconstruction services, our review is limited to RKE’s proposal as submitted.  In this regard, contracting agencies are not responsible f or 
evaluating information that is not included in a quotation or proposal.  Patriot Def . Grp., 
LLC, supra at 9.  I t was incumbent upon RKE  to submit a clear and adequate proposal 
for evaluation and its explanation in comments  filed in a post -award protest provides no 
 
6 For example, the protester contends its proposal discussed cost estimating where it 
stated that it produces reports that “at a minimum produce the basis for future design, site concepts, and well thought out construction cost estimates ,” and addressed value 
engineering where it stated that having the principal contractor engaged early “allows the contractor to have an input in the design of the scheme and suggest value engineering changes .”  Comments at 4.   Page 8 B-423394  basis to question the agency’s contemporaneous evaluation of the proposal as 
submitted.  
 The protester also argues that the lack of detail the agency claims was absent in its proposal is an unstated evaluation criterion and otherwise insufficient to support a rating of marginal.  Protest at 15- 18.  The crux of RKE’s argument is that “according to the 
RFP, merely addressing the eight challenges would result in an Acceptable rating.  There was no minimum detail threshold specified to achieve such.”  Id. at 16; see also 
Comments at 7 (“[T]his supposed issue with details was unsupported by the RFP criteria when the RFP merely said that offerors must ‘address’ each of the eight challenges.”).   
 Here, the RFP defined a rating of marginal as a proposal that “has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is high.”  RFP at 35.  As noted, the marginal rating assigned to RKE was  
the result of a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the evaluators, all of which stemmed from the lack of information provided in RKE’s proposal.  AR, Tab 11, RKE Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  For example, t he 
four weaknesses stated:   
 
The offeror identifies the necessity for coordination efforts for access to work locations but gives very little detail  as to what that looks like.  
 The offeror does not include any details  about coordination with owners or 
stakeholders and simply states they will coordinate when necessary.  
 The offeror describes how they will comply with contractual, administrative, and regulatory requirements by simply referencing their success in past performance and t hey do not include any details  of how 
this success is accomplished.  
 The offeror does not address specifics  on how to mitigate problems when 
dealing with emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, restricted access, supply chain demands, or on- site coordination.  
 Id. (emphasis added).  The RFP defined a weakness as a flaw in the proposal that 
increases the risk of unsuccessful performance.  RFP at 35.  The RFP further defined a deficiency  as “a material failure of a proposal to meet a government  requirement or a 
combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk  of 
unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. ”  Id.   
 To the extent the protester’s argument is that mere mention of each of the eight challenges was enough to earn a rating of acceptable, we do not agree.  Although the RFP stated that “offerors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable,” the RFP also stated that the agency would 
evaluate construction execution approach “on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its  Page 9 B-423394  relevance to the work that will be required in the Solicitation.”  RFP at 31.  The RFP also 
cautioned offerors that to evaluate proposals effectively and equitably, the agency had to receive “information containing sufficient detail to allow review and evaluation by the [g]overnment.”  Id. at 22.  Despite its claims that the agency ignored information in its 
proposal, the protester has not cited anything in its proposal to demonstrate that any of the weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiency identi fied by the agency are 
unreasonable.  Given the terms of the solicitation, which expressly contemplated evaluating the breadth, depth, and detail of information provided by an offeror, we find no basis to conclude that the rating of marginal is unreasonabl e, where the protester’s 
proposal did not discuss certain RFP requirements like preconstruction services, and therefore did not demonstrate an “adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.”  Accordingly, we deny these allegations.  
 Prejudice  
 Based on our resolution of the protest grounds above, we find that RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest.  We will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that but for the agency’s error, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  E.g. , Technica LLC , B-417177 et 
al., Mar. 21, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 125 at 5- 7.  Where the record establishes no possibil ity 
of competitive prejudice, we will not sustain the protest even if a defect in the procurement is found.  Procentrix, Inc., B -414629, B -414629.2, Aug. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 255 at 11- 12.   
 
Here, RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  This includes the protester’s challenges to its evaluation under the past performance and o rganization  management team factors.  Under the 
express terms of the RFP, a proposal that received less than an acceptable rating under a technical factor was ineligible to participate in phase two of the solicitation.  RFP at 34.  As explained above, the agency reasonably assigned RKE’s proposal a rating of 
margi nal under the construction execution approach factor, thus making RKE’s proposal 
ineligible for phase two of the competition and award even if it should have received higher ratings under the other factors.  Because RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to its remaining protest grounds, t hey are dismissed.  See The

Any proposal that receives less than an “Acceptable” rating in a technical factor or less than a “Satisfactory Confidence” past performance rating will be ineligible for award and will not participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  Based upon the ratings, the Government will select the most 
highly rated Offerors to participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  
 
Id. at 34.  
 The agency evaluated 21 phase one proposals received in response to the solicitation, including a proposal from RKE.  AR, Tab 13, Down- Select Decision Document at 4- 5.  
RKE received a past performance rating of s atisfactory confidence with a relevancy 
rating of somewhat relevant .  Id. at 5.  RKE was rated as marginal under the 
construction execution approach factor, and acceptable under the organization

the evaluation findings.  Because of its marginal rating under the construction execution 
factor, RKE’s proposal  was not included amongst the ten most highly qualified 
proposals  invited to phase two.  Id. at 5, 17.   
 On March 10, 2025, RKE received a debriefing that explained the agency’s rationale for 
the elimination of its proposal from phase two of the procurement.  AR, Tab 14, RKE Debriefing.  This protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably and irrationally eliminated RKE from phase two of the competition.  According to the protester, the ratings assigned by the agency are unreasonable given RKE’s capabilities and the information provided in i ts 
proposal.  Protest at 1.  The protester challenges its evaluation under each of the phase one evaluation factors, including the ratings assigned and all weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and a deficiency identified by the evaluators.  Id. at 10- 33. 
 At the outset, we note that in reviewing protests challenging the evaluation of an offeror’s proposal, it is not our role to reevaluate proposals; rather, our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency’s judgment was reasonable, and in acco rdance with applicable procurement statutes and regulations.

 For the reasons explained below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  We find that the agency reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to the protester’s proposal under the construction execution approach factor and that, as a result, the protester cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with regard to its remaining challenges.  While our decision does not address every variation of every argument raised by the protester, our Office has considered them all and find none afford a basis on whic h to 
sustain the protest.  
 Evaluation of RKE’s Construction Execution Approach  
 The protester argues that its proposal addressed all the minimum requirements to be rated acceptable rather than marginal under the construction execution approach factor, and the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Protest at 15- 16.  Specificall y, the 
protester challenges a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the agency, arguing the evaluation findings were flawed because the RFP did not require the level of detail the agency evaluated as missing from RKE’s  proposal.  
Alternatively, the protester argues that the agency failed to fully consider the information that RKE provided in its proposal.  Id.  at 15- 27. 
  Page 4 B-423394  The agency argues that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the 
evaluation criteria, and that it properly rated RKE’s proposal as marginal and deemed it ineligible for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 4.  In particular, the agency 
argues t hat the RFP emphasized the importance of experience performing 
preconstruction services , which RKE’s proposal failed to address, and that all the 
challenged findings validly stemmed from a common issue--a severe lack of detail in 
RKE’s  proposal . 
 Id. at 4-10.  We agree with the agency.  
 As relevant to the protester’s arguments, regarding construction execution approach, section 6.1.1 of the RFP required that offerors provide a narrative approach to address 
the following eight challenges : 
 a) Understanding of the process to adequately address and anticipate both the benefits  and risks associated with Design- Build projects for U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers  or other [Department of Defense]  component.  
 b) Discussion on the utilization of alternative delivery methods and preconstruction services as identified in paragraph 5.2.2 to include a comparison of differences between the public and private sector constraints.
[5] 
 c) Sourcing and management of major materials (e.g., borrow material, steel, concrete, etc.) and mitigation of major supply chain issues.  
 d) Obtaining access to work locations.  
 e) Coordination with local property owners and stakeholders.  
 f) Compliance with contractual, administrative, and other requirements.  
 g) Hiring qualified laborers and maintaining a qualified workforce.  
 h) Coordination with multiple contractors on site.  
 RFP at 30- 31.  The RFP limited narrative responses to 10 pages.  Id.   Section 6.1.2 of 
the RFP stated the agency would evaluate the narrative response provided in the proposal as follows:    
a) Offerors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable.  
 
 
5 Paragraph 5.2.2 of the RFP referred to a number of different preconstruction services, 
including cost estimation, evaluation of design documents for constructability, recommendations on construction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other  things.  RFP at 29.   Page 5 B-423394  b) Evidence of understanding and mitigating the construction execution 
challenges specific to Civil Works Program through traditional Design- Bid-
Build and Design- Build processes may be considered a strength.  
 c) Offerors should demonstrate understanding and experience in the execution of preconstruction services.  An acceptable discussion would identify experience performing preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project success, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the owner and/or stakeholders.  
 d) Approaches that provided innovative means and/or methods for operating in unforeseen conditions including, but not limited to, emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, real estate coordination, restricted access, supply chain demands, on site coordination, environmental compliance issues, and long lead  
item procurement process may be considered a strength.  
 Id. at 31.  The RFP stated that the narratives should substantiate the offeror’s 
construction approach by relating technical solutions and project execution challenges, and that the government would evaluate “the offeror’s technical approach on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its relevance to the work” required by the RFP.  Id.  
 The evaluators identified the following deficiency in RKE’s proposal under the construction execution approach factor:  “ Instead of listing how the work would be 
achieved, the Offeror repeated what was in the RFP as a response to Section 6.1.1.  
The SSEB [Source Selection Evaluation Board] noted that the offeror’s proposal 
occasionally reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the solicitation and does not provide adequate details to demonstrate understanding of the requirements. ”  AR, Tab 11, Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  This deficiency 
was in addition to three significant weaknesses and four weaknesses, each of which to varying degrees identify RKE’s failure to discuss or adequately detail its approach to various aspects of the requirement.  For example, one significant weakness stated:  “The importance and usage of preconstruction services (as specified in Section 6.1.2.C) is not discussed within this proposal.”  Id.    
 The evaluators provided the following rationale for assigning a marginal rating:  
 
Overall, the construction execution approach proposed by [RKE] does not demonstrate an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is high. . . .  [RKE] does not demonstrate that they have a thorough approa ch to construction 
execution.  The information provided does not provide sufficient detail when describing their experience or knowledge of design- build and the 
important elements necessary for success as listed in this solicitation.  [RFP] Section 6.1.2.C  states that the offeror should demonstrate  Page 6 B-423394  understanding and experience in execution of preconstruction services.  
The application of preconstruction services is one of the main benefits of the Design- Build process and the proposal “has not demonstrated an 
adequate understanding of the requirements ” by leaving out 
preconstruction services. . . .  The proposal indicates a marginal approach and understanding of the requirements of the solicitation such that the SSEB is confident that the risk of unsuccessful performance is high.  
 Id.  The agency argues that the evaluators reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to 
RKE’s construction execution approach, and in accordance with the RFP its proposal 
was properly deemed ineligible for award.  MOL at 3 -4. The agency explains that the 
protester’s proposal did not include an adequate discussion of preconstruction services, including cost estimating, evaluation of design documents for constructability, identification of construction related problems or errors in design, recommendations on cons truction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other things required by 
the solicitation.  Id.  at 5. 
 In a negotiated procurement, it is an offeror’s responsibility to submit a well -written 
proposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Probity, 
Inc., B-420210, Dec. 21, 2021, 2023 CPD ¶ 38 at 3.  If a proposal omits, inadequately 
addresses, or fails to clearly convey required information, the offeror runs the risk of an adverse agency evaluation.  See Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc. , B-418375.2,  May 28, 
2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 207 at 4.  
 
On this record, we find that the protester has not demonstrated that the agency’s 
evaluation was flawed.  The protester argues that its proposal did indeed address 
preconstruction services, along with the utilization of alternate delivery methods, as requi red by the RFP.  Protest at 21- 22 (citing AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal  
at 69- 70).  In support of its position, RKE points to the following paragraph of its 
proposal under the heading “ Construction Manager as Constructor (CMC) and 
Construction Manager at Risk ( CMAR) ,” which states as follows:  
 
A defining characteristic of a Construction Manager  [as Constructor]  
(CMC) contract (of any type) is the timing of their  involvement in the 
project.  In the traditional Design- Bid-Build delivery method, the 
construction entity is  not involved until the “Bid” portion of the project. 
Design occurs without the involvement of a  construction entity.   When a 
construction manager is involved by contract, they are involved in “preconstruction”  activities.  Therefore, during design, they can be 
contracted to offer s chedule, budget, and constructability input or 
feedback to the owner.  This early involvement can be beneficial if the owner and/or design firm do not have strong construction experience to draw upon internally.  
 AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal at 69 (emphasis added).    Page 7 B-423394   
The paragraph quoted above, however, is the only place with any mention of preconstruction, and the protester has not cited to any other portion of its proposal to demonstrate that it provided “[a] n acceptable discussion [identify ing] experience 
performing preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project 
success, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the 
owner and/or stakeholders ,” as required by the RFP.  See  RFP at 31.  Instead, the 
remaining three paragraphs in this section of the proposal provide a general discussion of the relationships under a CMC and CMAR approach but fail to provide specific experience with a project in which RKE performed preconstruction services, their influence on the succ ess of the project, or how the services mitigated risks and provided 
benefits to owners of and stakeholders of the project.  See generally  AR, Tab 9, RKE 
Proposal at 69- 70.  We also note RKE’s proposal provided less than four full pages of 
narrative response, less than half of the 10 pages the RFP permitted for offerors to explain their construction execution approach.  Id. at 68 -71. 
 After review of the agency report, RKE cites to additional sections of its proposal and argues that in addition to addressing preconstruction services generally, its proposal also addressed the preconstruction services of cost estimating, constructability,  
identification of construction- related problems, and value engineering.
6  See  Comments 
at 3-6.  The protester argues that “[a]t best, [the agency] can suggest that that portion of 
the proposal focused too heavily on alternative delivery methods to the detriment of preconstruction services . . . and fails to understand the relations hip between alternative 
delivery methods and preconstruction services.”  Id. at 4.  However, as noted above, 
while the RFP required offerors to address their utilization of alternative delivery 
methods and preconstruction services, the evaluation criteria emphasized that offerors 
should “demonstrate understanding and experience in  the execution of preconstruction 
services.”  RFP at 31.  RKE failed to heed this directive at the risk of an unfavorable evaluation.  Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc., supra.  Moreov er, the language from RKE’s 
proposal that it cites as examples of where it addressed preconstruction services provides limited detail and instead often simply restates solicitation requirements, which is why the agency assessed the deficiency under this factor.  
 To the extent the protester now seeks to more clearly articulate the information provided in its proposal to address preconstruction services, our review is limited to RKE’s proposal as submitted.  In this regard, contracting agencies are not responsible f or 
evaluating information that is not included in a quotation or proposal.  Patriot Def . Grp., 
LLC, supra at 9.  I t was incumbent upon RKE  to submit a clear and adequate proposal 
for evaluation and its explanation in comments  filed in a post -award protest provides no 
 
6 For example, the protester contends its proposal discussed cost estimating where it 
stated that it produces reports that “at a minimum produce the basis for future design, site concepts, and well thought out construction cost estimates ,” and addressed value 
engineering where it stated that having the principal contractor engaged early “allows the contractor to have an input in the design of the scheme and suggest value engineering changes .”  Comments at 4.   Page 8 B-423394  basis to question the agency’s contemporaneous evaluation of the proposal as 
submitted.  
 The protester also argues that the lack of detail the agency claims was absent in its proposal is an unstated evaluation criterion and otherwise insufficient to support a rating of marginal.  Protest at 15- 18.  The crux of RKE’s argument is that “according to the 
RFP, merely addressing the eight challenges would result in an Acceptable rating.  There was no minimum detail threshold specified to achieve such.”  Id. at 16; see also 
Comments at 7 (“[T]his supposed issue with details was unsupported by the RFP criteria when the RFP merely said that offerors must ‘address’ each of the eight challenges.”).   
 Here, the RFP defined a rating of marginal as a proposal that “has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is high.”  RFP at 35.  As noted, the marginal rating assigned to RKE was  
the result of a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the evaluators, all of which stemmed from the lack of information provided in RKE’s proposal.  AR, Tab 11, RKE Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  For example, t he 
four weaknesses stated:   
 
The offeror identifies the necessity for coordination efforts for access to work locations but gives very little detail  as to what that looks like.  
 The offeror does not include any details  about coordination with owners or 
stakeholders and simply states they will coordinate when necessary.  
 The offeror describes how they will comply with contractual, administrative, and regulatory requirements by simply referencing their success in past performance and t hey do not include any details  of how 
this success is accomplished.  
 The offeror does not address specifics  on how to mitigate problems when 
dealing with emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, restricted access, supply chain demands, or on- site coordination.  
 Id. (emphasis added).  The RFP defined a weakness as a flaw in the proposal that 
increases the risk of unsuccessful performance.  RFP at 35.  The RFP further defined a deficiency  as “a material failure of a proposal to meet a government  requirement or a 
combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk  of 
unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. ”  Id.   
 To the extent the protester’s argument is that mere mention of each of the eight challenges was enough to earn a rating of acceptable, we do not agree.  Although the RFP stated that “offerors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable,” the RFP also stated that the agency would 
evaluate construction execution approach “on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its  Page 9 B-423394  relevance to the work that will be required in the Solicitation.”  RFP at 31.  The RFP also 
cautioned offerors that to evaluate proposals effectively and equitably, the agency had to receive “information containing sufficient detail to allow review and evaluation by the [g]overnment.”  Id. at 22.  Despite its claims that the agency ignored information in its 
proposal, the protester has not cited anything in its proposal to demonstrate that any of the weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiency identi fied by the agency are 
unreasonable.  Given the terms of the solicitation, which expressly contemplated evaluating the breadth, depth, and detail of information provided by an offeror, we find no basis to conclude that the rating of marginal is unreasonabl e, where the protester’s 
proposal did not discuss certain RFP requirements like preconstruction services, and therefore did not demonstrate an “adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.”  Accordingly, we deny these allegations.  
 Prejudice  
 Based on our resolution of the protest grounds above, we find that RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest.  We will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that but for the agency’s error, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  E.g. , Technica LLC , B-417177 et 
al., Mar. 21, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 125 at 5- 7.  Where the record establishes no possibil ity 
of competitive prejudice, we will not sustain the protest even if a defect in the procurement is found.  Procentrix, Inc., B -414629, B -414629.2, Aug. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD 
¶ 255 at 11- 12.   
 
Here, RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  This includes the protester’s challenges to its evaluation under the past performance and o rganization  management team factors.  Under the 
express terms of the RFP, a proposal that received less than an acceptable rating under a technical factor was ineligible to participate in phase two of the solicitation.  RFP at 34.  As explained above, the agency reasonably assigned RKE’s proposal a rating of 
margi nal under the construction execution approach factor, thus making RKE’s proposal 
ineligible for phase two of the competition and award even if it should have received higher ratings under the other factors.  Because RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to its remaining protest grounds, t hey are dismissed.  See The 
Mission Essential Grp., LLC , B-423053, B -423053.2, Jan. 15, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶ 39 at

Reston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a call order to i3, LLC,  a small business  of 
Fairfax, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  MPO -TEM -SCO R-4, issued by 
the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for management  of the 
agency’s information technology enterprise,  mobile device products and data plans.   
The protester argues that the agency  unreasonably evaluated vendors’ quotations and 
that the resultant  best-value determination and source selection decision were flawed . DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423190; B -423190.2    
We deny the protest . 
 BACKGROUND  
 On September 20, 2024, the FBI  issued the RFQ to holders of the information 
technology supplies and support services (ITSSS -2) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) 
pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4.   
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1.
1  The solicitation contemplated the 
issuance of a call order to provide professional services “to support the [agency] in the 
management of FBI IT [information technology] mobile device products funded and supported for the enterprise[,]” with an expectation that the contractor would manage “at 
least 40,000- 50,000 mobile devices along with their inventory and carrier voice/data 
plans.”  Id .  The RFQ anticipated a 1- year base period of performance along with four 1 -
year options, and an additional 6- month option to extend services.  Agency Report  (AR), 
Tab 3.1, RFQ at  7.  
 
The RFQ advised that the FBI  intended to issue the call order to the vendor whose 
quotation represented the best value to the government, and that determination of the best-value quotation would be made using a tradeoff process.  Id. at 31.  The RFQ 
provided that in determining the best -value quotation, the agency would consider the 
following factors , listed in descending order of importance:  (1) technical approach; 
(2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id.  The solicitation stated that the agency “is more 
concerned with obtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government.”  Id. at 32.  
 The RFQ stated that for each non- price factor, the FBI  would assess one of the 
following confidence ratings:  low confidence, some confidence, or high confidence.  Id . 
at 34.  The rating was  based on the vendor’s  demonstrated ability to understand the 
requirement, whether the vendor proposed a sound approach or demonstrated  similar 
past performance to the current requirement , and the degree to which the government 
determined  the vendor could be successful in performing the requirement without 
government int ervention.  Id .   
 For the price factor, the RFQ instructed vendors  to complete a pricing template, 
including proposing labor categories necessary to meet the objectives of the solicitation and in accordance with the labor categories contained in the vendors’ underlying BPA s.  
Id. at 31;  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  For each labor category 
proposed, the template required vendors to include their  fully burdened labor rates 
(FBRs) from their underlying BPAs.   AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.   
Each vendor could then, if it desired, propose for each labor category  a percentage 
discount to the FBR to arrive at a quoted price rate for each labor category .  Id.  The 
total evaluated price would be determined by adding together the quoted price for each 
 
1 All page number citations refer to the Adobe Acrobat PDF page numbers of the 
versions of documents provided by the parties.   Page 3    B-423190; B -423190.2   labor category across the base year and all option years (including the 6- month option 
to extend services), in addition to certain fixed costs provided by the agency.  Id. at 3.    
The RFQ advised that price would be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  
RFQ at 33.  With regard to completeness, quotations would be assessed base d on their 
responsiveness in providing price data for all solicitation requirements.  To be complete, a quotation had to contain “all prices necessary to support the quote[,]” and was required to “be accurate with no mathematical error s.”  Id.    
 The FBI  received quotations from eight vendors , including IMTA S and i3.  AR, Tab 8, 
Basis of Award  at 2.  The agency ’s evaluation of quotations under the solicitation’s 
non-price factors yielded the following relevant results:  
 
 IMTA S i3 
Technical Approach  Low Confidence  High Confidence  
Corp. Experience  Low Confidence  High Confidence  
Price  $5,767,769  $6,030,960  
 Id. at 6, 7.  With respect to the price factor , the FBI evaluated IMTA S’s quotation for 
completeness and reasonableness as prescribed by the solicitation.  Though the agency determined that the protester’s total evaluated price of $5,767,769 was 
reasonable, the agency also determined that the protester’s pricing was “ incomplete. ”  
AR, Tab 7, Price Report at 3.  The agency found that one of the FBR’s on IMTA S’s 
pricing template did not match the rate in its underlying BPA across option years 1, 2, 3, 4, and the 6- month option to extend services.  Id.  Specifically, for one of t he mid- level 
database administrator positions IMTAS’s quotation identified an FBR that was $0.01-$0.02 less than the FBR from the underlying BPA.  See id.   As a result,  the FBI 
excluded the protester’s quotation from further consideration, and did not include it in its best-value tradeoff  determination.   AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 9.  
 Ultimately, the FBI selected i3 for the call order at a price of $6, 030,960.  The agency 
provided a brief notice of explanation to vendors, including IMTA S, on November 12, 
and the protester subsequently timely filed this protest with our Office.   
 DISCUSSION  IMTA S raises various challenges to the FBI’s evaluation of quotations and best -value 
tradeoff  determination.  See  Protest at 15- 29; Comments & Supp. Protest at 2 -21.  For 
the reasons explained below,  although we find that the agency unreasonably evaluated 
the protester’s price quotation, we also conclude that the protest er has not established it 
was competitively  prejudiced  in this regard and therefore deny the challenge to the price 
evaluation.  W e also deny the protester’s remaining challenges .

2 Though our decision does not address every argument raised by the protester, our 
Office has considered all of them and find that none afford a basis on which to sustain 
the protest.   Page 4    B-423190; B -423190.2    
Price Evaluation  
 IMTA S argues that the FBI’s evaluation of the price factor was unreasonable.  As noted 
above, the agency determined that the protester’s price quotation was incomplete because the FBR for one of the labor categories did not match the labor rate in the protester’s underlying BPA.  The protester contends that this decision was unreasonabl e because the mismatched labor rate was the result of  a “$0.01 scrivener’s 
error in a single [s]chedule [r]ate” which “did not impact the total price” proposed.  Protest at 27.  Furthermore, the protester argues that the agency “had all required information to ascertain the exact amount” of its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  IMTA S additionally contends that the agency abused its discretion by not 
permitting IMTAS  to correct the issue through clarifications.   Protest at 27.  
 The FBI argues that the protester’s quotation contained a “clear and undisputable error,” and that i ts determination that the protester’s pricing was incomplete was because the 
pricing failed to meet the clear instruction and requirements of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (M OL) at 14.  The agency contends that it was due to this 
“material non- compliance in the price quotation” that the protester’s quotation was 
“removed from the competition prior to the [a]gency’s tradeoff analysis.”  Id. at 16.  
Finally, the agency argues that the solicitation did not require the agency to engage in clarifications and that, in any event, any exchanges with the protester would have resulted in quotation revisions that amounted to discussions.  Id . at 15.  
 In reviewing protests of an agency’s evaluation, we do not reevaluate quotations or 
substitute ou r judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of quotations is a 
matter within the agency’s discretion.  DigiFlight, Inc. , B-419590, B -419590.2, May 24, 
2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 206 at 5.  Rather, we will review the record to determine if the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id .  Based on our review of the 
record, we find the agency unreasonably evaluat ed the protester’s pricing and 
subsequently abused its discretion in excluding the protester’s quotation from the 
best-value tradeoff analysis .  However, as discussed below, we conclude that the 
protest er has not shown competitive prejudice with respect to this error and therefore 
decline to sustain the protest on this basis.  
 As explained above, the RFQ required vendors to complete a pricing template, which in 
part required vendors to propose labor categories and include corresponding FBRs from 
their underlying BPAs.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  In this 
regard, the solicitation stated that each vendor “shall populate the [FBR] [c]olumns [of the pricing template] to match the [vendor’s] published [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate” and that vendors could “apply discounts to the FBR by populating the [percent] in [the] [d]iscount [c]olumns [of the spreadsheet].”   Id.  The product of the FBR and any proposed discount 
represented the vendor’s “quoted rate” for a particular labor category  and accordingly 
contributed to the vendor’s total evaluated price.   See  id at 2.   
  Page 5    B-423190; B -423190.2   The agency would evaluate v endors’ pricing for completeness and reasonableness  in 
the manner described above.  RFQ  at 33.  The solicitation further contained general 
provisions permitting, but not requiring, the agency to find vendors’ quotations ineligible 
for award.  For example, the RFQ stated that “[f]ailure to comply with the solicitation requirements may result in the [vendor’s] submission being deemed ineligible for 
award[,]” and that “[f]ailure to submit the information or documentation required by [the] RFQ . . . may result in the [quotation] being deemed non -compliant and rejected by the 
[g]overnment.”  Id. at 28, 34.  
 IMTA S proposed two mid -level database administrator positions  as part of  its pricing for 
the base period of performance, each option year, and the 6- month option to extend 
services.   AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quot ation at 2.  Using the protester’s  option year 1 
data as an example,
3 the record reflects that one of these  positions listed an FBR of 
$124.89, and a proposed discount of  [DELETED]  percent; the resultant quoted price 
was an hourly  rate of $ [DELETED] .  Id.  The parties agree that  the FBR and the 
resultant quoted price for this  first position are accurate .  However, for  the second 
mid-level database administrator  position, the protester ’s quotation id entified an FBR of 
$124.88 instead of $124.89, and a proposed discount of [DELETED]  percent .  The 
resultant quoted price was a n hourly  rate of  $[DELETED] --the same quoted rate as that 
for IMTAS’s first mid -level database administrator .  Id.  The dispute here concerns the 
FBR for the second database administrator .  It is undisputed that the correct option 
year 1 FBR from the BPA  was $ 124.89, rather than $124.88--the error in the protester’s 
quotation for the option year 1 FBR was thus in the amount of $0.01.    
 The FBI determined that, though reasonable, IMTA S’s pricing was incomplete for 
“failing to provide the accurate [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate”  for one of  the mid -level database 
administrator positions  in option year 1 through the 6- month extension of services.  AR, 
Tab 7, Price Report at 3.  Although the agency completed its evaluation of IMTAS’s price quotation, due to this error, the FBI “removed [the quotation] from the tradeoff decision” and did not further consider IMTA S for the call order.  AR, Tab 8, Basis  of 
Award at 9.  
 Under these unique circumstances, we find the FBI  unreasonably determined IMTA S’s 
pricing to be incomplete.   The solicitation  established the following requirements :  
(1) vendors were required to submit pricing templates containing FBRs that matched the 
vendors’ underlying BPA rates for each labor category; (2) the quoted rate for each 
labor category , which was used to arrive at the total evaluated price,  was derived from 
the vendors’ FBR rates multiplied by any proposed discount; (3) pricing would be evaluated for completeness, including whether the quotation “provide[d] all prices 
necessary to support the quote[,] ” and was free of “mathematical errors”; and ( 4) a 
 
3 This decision uses the data from option year 1 as an example throughout.  As 
previously explained, option years 2, 3, and 4, and the 6- month option to extend 
services contained similar typographical errors  with respect to the FBR , some in the 
amount of $0.01 and some in the amount of $0.02.  See  AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price 
Quot ation at 2.  Page 6    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation that failed to provide the information required by the solicitation “may” result in 
the quotation being deemed ineligible for award.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ attach. 2 , Pricing 
Template at 1; RFQ at 33- 34. 
 
IMTA S does not dispute the fact that its quotation listed an FBR for one of its proposed 
mid-level database administrator positions  that did not match the rate on its underlying 
BPA.  Rather, the protester asserts that this error did not matter, and the FBI’s subsequent determination that its proposed pricing was incomplete was unreasonable, because the error “did not factor into the calculation of the overall quoted cost at all [,]” 
and that the agency otherwise had all of the information it needed to evaluate its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  In this regard, the protester maintains that the q uoted 
rate it provided for the labor category  in question was  ultimately  correct, so the agency’s 
focus on an error with the underlying BPA rate was misplaced.  Id .  We agree with 
IMTA S.   
 The basis of the FBI’s  finding that IMTAS’s  pricing was incomplete was that the 
protester failed to accurately  identify the underlying rates from IMTAS’s FSS BPA for 
one of its two mid -level database administrator  positions.  We find the agency’s 
determination in this regard unreasonable.   The FBR from a vendor’s BPA was not  the 
basis for the evaluation of a vendor’s price, it was the “quoted price,” and the quoted price was based on a discount from the vendor ’s FBR on its BPA.   As the protester 
explains, although one of its proposed FBRs contained a $0.01 error, its  discount rate 
adjusted by 0.01 percent arrived at the  quoted labor rate the protester intended to 
propose.   Specifically , for the first mid -level database administrator position, IMTAS  
used the correct  FBR from its BPA  of $124.89 with a [DELETED] percent discount , 
which yielded a quoted pri ce of $[DELETED] .  For the second position, with the 
“erroneous” FBR  from its BPA of $124.88 and a [DELETED]  percent discount --as the 
protester ’s pricing template provided--yield ed an identical  quoted price of $[DELETED] .  
See AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quotation at  2.     
 Importantly, the FBI was indisputably aware that IMTAS had submitted accurate pricing 
for the  other identical  mid-level database administrator position, for which the protester 
included the correct FBR of $124.89 for option year 1.
  For that line item, the protester’s 
quoted price was a rate of $[DELETED] .  The protester’s quoted price for the other 
midlevel database administrator position, in dispute here, was also $[DELETED] .  
Despite the incorrect underlying FBR, the quoted price matched that of the other mid-level database administrator position that the agency knew was accurate; t he 
protester’s mere typographical error for one of its positions thus cannot constitute a 
material omission,  where the correct information was contained within the protester’s 
quotation (on the line above the incorrect information) .  This  is particularly evident 
where the actual “quoted price,”  i.e., the price used for the evaluation, was the same for 
the identical labor categories .   
 Consistent with the terms of the solicitation, the protester’s quotation did contain “all prices necessary to support the quote” and did not contain any actual “mathematical errors .” RFQ at 33.   The agency has not alleged that it could not evaluate IMTAS’s price  Page 7    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation; in fact, the agency determined that the protester’s overall price was 
reasonable.   
 Furthermore, the solicitation did not require the FBI  to determine IMTAS’s  quotation 
ineligible, instead providing that the failure to include required  information “may” result in 
the quotation being determined ineligible for award.  See RFQ at 28, 34.   In the face of 
other pricing information for the same accurate labor category, we find the agency’s 
decision to exclude the protester’s quotation from the best -value tradeoff based on a 
$0.01 typographical error that had no impact on the protester’s overall  quoted price to 
be unreasonable.  However, because IMTAS cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice as a result of this error, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.  
 The intervenor argues that even if the agency erred in excluding IMTAS from the best -
value tradeoff, the protester cannot show prejudice because it “would still not have had a substantial chance of receiving the award because . . . its technical and past performance ratings were substantially lower than i3’s and those factors were more 
important than price.”  Intervenor Comments at 19.  We agree.  
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency ’s actions, it would have had a substantial 
chance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Cargo Transport Sys. Co. , B-411646.6, B -411646.7, Oct. 17, 
2016, 2016  CPD ¶ 294 at 9 n.14.  Based on our review of the record, IMTAS has not 
demonstrated competitive prejudice because it has not shown that it had a substantial chance of receiving award even if the agency had accepted its price quotation and 
considered its quotation as part of the best -value tradeoff.  See Orbit Research, LLC , 
B-417462, July 17, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 258, at  7. 
 The solicitation stated that the technical approach factor was more important than  the 
past performance factor and that both these factors were more important than price.  RFQ at 3 1.  The RFQ also informed vendors that the agency “is more concerned with 
obtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government”  but that the agency would not make award at a “significantly higher 
overall cost to achieve slightly superior technical skills.”   Id. at 32.   
 The agency assigned IMTAS’s quotation ratings of  low confidence --the lowest possible 
rating--to each of the non-price factors.  Although IMTAS challenges these ratings, as 
explained below, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester’s quotation as low confidence under both the technical and past performance factors.  Accordingly, IMTAS’s quotation offered the lowest ratings on the more important non- price factors 
and had a lower price than the awardee by less than five percent.  In contrast , the 
awardee i3 received ratings of high confidence--the highest possible rating--in each non-price factor with a price that was approximately  $263,200 higher than the 
protester’s price.  
  Page 8    B-423190; B -423190.2   On this record, we conclude that the protester has not established  that the agency’s 
unreasonable decision to exclude the protester from the best-value tradeoff decision 
based on the price evaluation resulted in competitive prejudice.  In this regard, even if 
the agency included IMTAS’s quotation in the best -value determination, its low 
confidence ratings and minimal cost savings  do not support a conclusion that IMTAS 
would have a substantial chance of receiving award.   The solicitation provided that the 
agency was more concerned with obtaining superior technical skills than awarding at the lowest overall price.  RFQ at 32.  Here, i3’s high conf idence ratings on both the non-
price factors indicate that its quotation demonstrated superior technical skills as compared to the low confidence ratings that IMTAS received.  Moreover, at less than a five percent premium, i3’s quotation does not represent  a “significantly higher overall 
cost” to achieve the superior technical skills.  Because IMTAS has not established that it 
had a substantial chance of receiving award even with the agency’s unreasonable price evaluation, w e deny this protest ground.
  
 Technical Approach Evaluation  
 IMTA S raises various arguments challenging the FBI’s evaluation of its quotation under 
the technical approach factor.  The protester contends that the agency’s assessment of a rating of low confidence under the factor was unreasonable because its quotation received “an equal number of areas of increased confidence and decreased confidence” that should have merited a rating of at least some confidence.  Protest at 16.  The protester also argues that each of the agency’s decreased confidence findings were inconsistent with the stated evaluation criteria or , in the alternative,  otherwise 
demonstrated by its quotation.  Id . at 16- 23. 
 The FBI argues that its evaluation of IMTA S’s technical approach was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and that the protester’s arguments amount to mere disagreement with its reasonable judgment.  M OL at 3.   The agency maintains 
that the solicitation did not require the assessment of a certain confidence rating based on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings, “bu t rather, the 
[g]overnment’s level of confidence in the [vendors’] understanding of the requirement .”  
Id.; COS at 5.  Furthermore, the agency contends that the  decreased confidence 
findings w ere not based on unstated evaluation criteria and that the protester’s 
arguments in the alternative, that the protester did meet the allegedly unstated requirements, should fail because the protester did not provide sufficient detail in its plan for meeting the requirements.  See MOL at 5 -8. 
 Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the issuance of an order, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitat ion and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  DataSavers of 
Jacksonville, Inc. , B-415113.3, Aug. 24, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 290 at 4.  Furthermore, our 
Office has consistently stated that the evaluation of proposals and the assignment of adjectival ratin gs should not be based upon a simple count of strengths and 
weaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals consistent with the  Page 9    B-423190; B -423190.2   evaluation scheme.  Perspecta Eng’g, Inc. , B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, 
2022 CPD ¶ 314 at 10.  Adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and 
not a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Id. 
 At the outset, we find that IMTA S’s argument that it should have received at least a 
rating of some confidence under the technical approach factor because its quotation was assessed an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings is meritless.  Though the protester argues i t “is difficult to conceive” how it could have 
received a rating of low confidence and that “pure logic dictates” that an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings merits at least a some confidence 
rating,  its argument is premised on the number of increased and decreased confidence 
findings the agency assessed to its quotation.  Protest at 16; Comments & Supp. 
Protest at 7.  
 Notably, here the RFQ did not prescribe the assessment of a particular adjectival rating for the non- price evaluation factors  based upon the number of increased confidence or 
decreased confidence findings that a quotation was assessed.  See  RFQ at 34.  As 
explained above, adjectival ratings reflect  a qualitative assessment of quotations, and 
the protester’s focus on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings does not establish a basis to sustain the protest where the RFQ did not require a cer tain 
confidence rating be assessed for a quotation containing a certain number increased or decreased confidence findings.  See Inalab Consulting, Inc. , B-422438 et al. , June 18, 
2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 145 at 7.  
 The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably assessed all three of the 
decreased confidence findings under the technical approach factor .  Based on our 
review of the record, we find that the agency reasonably assessed all three of the 
decreased confidence findings .  We address a representative sample.  
 The RFQ instructed vendors to provide a written approach that demonstrated their  
ability to meet the technical requirements contained in sections three and four of the RFQ.  RFQ at 30.  This approach was to include, inter alia , a plan to support the agency 
telecommunications expense management team and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  Id .  Sections three and four of the RFQ contained specific 
requirements and information relating to the data capture and analysis component of the technical approach factor .  For example, the RFQ advised that the successful 
contract or would be responsible for merging carrier data with FBI data.  RFQ at 13.   
 The FBI further clarified through solicitation questions and answers (Q&A), which were incorporated into the solicitation by amendment , certain aspects of the solicitation 
requirement concerning vendors’ approaches to improving data capture and analysis .  
See AR, Tab 3.6, RFQ Q&A.  For example, the agency advised that mobile “ [c]arriers 
provide raw data exports that are imported into FBI systems[,]” and that the successful 
contract or would “be responsible for maintaining  the relationship with carriers in support 
of the FBI.”  Id . at 2 -3.  
  Page 10    B-423190; B -423190.2   The RFQ provided that vendors’ approaches would be evaluated based on the agency’s 
level of confidence that the proposed methods would be successful, including the clarity 
of any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  RFQ  at 32.   As explained 
above, the RFQ provided that the technical approach factor would be assessed an adjectival rating of low, some, or high confidence based in part on the agency’s “confidence that the [vendor] understands the requirement” and “proposes a sound approach.”  Id . at 34.  
 IMTAS submitted its technical volume to include its approach to data capture and analysis.  In this regard, the protester described the platforms used to merge carrier data and included its approach to vendor management and support.  Specifically, the protester provided that it would “ensure vendor partnerships are effectively managed[,]” 
and that it would “have regular interactions [with carriers] to ensure dependencies are met, services levels for data extraction are maintained[,] and identify mechanisms to enhance, automate and improve the data collection in ingestion process.”  AR, Tab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Approach at 11.   The FBI assessed a decreased finding to IMTAS’s technical approach, stating that “IMTAS does not identify [a] relationship with carriers on how they will obtain raw data for ingestion which decreases confidence [to] support the [agency] and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  This lack of specificity decreases confidence as the vendor would not be able to support the specific carrier relationships.”  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 13.  
 We find no basis to question the FBI’s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in 
this regard.  The RFQ provided that vendors were required to explain their methods and submit approaches to improving data capture and analysis, as identified in the requirements section of the solicitation.  That section explained that part of the agency’s requirement involved merging carrier data with FBI data, and the questions and 
answers  clarified both that carriers would be providing the raw data, and that the 
successful contractor would be responsible for maintaining relationships with those carriers.  As the decreased confidence finding indicates, and t he contracting officer  
further  explains , the protester’s failure to demonstrate how it would maintain a 
relationship with carriers regarding data capture and analysis was the contributing basis to this decreased confidence finding.  COS at  6-7; AR Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation 
at 13.  Thus, we find the agency’s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in this 
regard was consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  
 Furthermore, we disagree with IMTAS’s argument that its quotation in fact demonstrated the required methods and approach to improving data capture and analysis through a relationship with carriers.  In response to the protest, the contracting officer indic ates that the protester’s offered approach of “ensur[ing] vendor partnerships 
are effectively managed” and “leverag[ing] structured management practices” and “participat[ing] in weekly [] program meetings” does not provide sufficient detail to demonstrate a plan for improving data capture and analysis requirements.  COS at 7.   Page 11    B-423190; B -423190.2   We have no basis to find  the agency’s conclusion in this regard unreasonable .4  
Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.5   
 
Past Performance Evaluation  
 IMTA S also  challenges the FBI’s past performance evaluation for both its own and i3’s 
quotations.   We discuss the challenges in turn below.  
 
IMTA S’s Past Performance 
 IMTA S initially contends that because it received more increased confidence findings 
(3) than decreased confidence findings  (2) under the past performance factor , the 
agency’s assessment of a rating of low confidence overall was unreasonable.  Protest at 23.  The protester also challenges the FBI’s specific decreased confidence findings  
assessed to its quotation under this factor .  In this regard, the protester alleges that the 
agency faulted the protester’s past performance submission for failing to demonstrate experience with “SAFe [m]ethodologies,”
6 despite the solicitation not specifying such 
experience as a requirement.  Id. at 24.  IMTAS  also contends that the agency had 
information “too close at hand” to ignore regarding the protester’s experience with SAFe methodologies.  Id . at 25.  Finally, the protester maintains that the agency’s assessment 
 
4 The protester also argues that it demonstrated the solicitation requirement through the 
experience of one of its key personnel, a program manager.  Protest at 17.  As with the protester’s  other argument, the agency explains that proposing this program manager 
and documenting his experience with “vendor interaction” and “vendor communications” is insufficient to show a plan and approach to improving data capture and analysis methods, and we find no basis to question the agency’s judgment in this regard.  Protest at 17; COS at 8.   
5 IMTAS also challenges the FBI’s assessment of a decreased confidence finding for 
failing to offer a plan or approach to increase efficiencies or reduce costs.  Protest at 20-23.  In response, the agency argues that IMTAS’s quotation merely regurgitated 
solicitation requirements, in violation of the solicitation instruction that vendors not 
“simply rephrase or restate” the requirements.  The contracting officer provided specific 
sections of both the RFQ and the protester’s quotation as examples of where the protester merely restated RFQ requirements.  In its comments the protester restated the 
same arguments from its protest and did not otherwise meaningfully respond to the FBI’s arguments.  We therefore find this find this aspect of the protest to be abandoned.  
See Zin Technologies, Inc. , B-422405, B -422405.2, June 13, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 154 
at 13 n.12 (dismissing protest ground as abandoned where protester failed to 
meaningfully respond to specific information provided by the agency and otherwise provided a near verbatim recitation previous arguments).  
6 “SAFe” refers to scaled agile framework , which is “an enterprise agility framework that 
helps organizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization. ”  RFQ at 9 ; IntelliBridge, LLC , B-421560.9, Aug. 8, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 188 
at 2.  Page 12    B-423190; B -423190.2   of a decreased confidence finding with respect to its third past performance example 
amounted to application of an unstated evaluation criterion, because the solicitation did not require vendors to submit three past performance examples.  Id . at 26. 
 The FBI  argues that it reasonably evaluated IMTA S’s past performance submission in a 
manner consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  T he agency maintains that the 
solicitation did not require an assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence findings, so the protester’s argument that it should have received a higher rating because it had a greater number of increased confidence findings is meritless.  MOL at 9.  
 The agency further contends that the solicitation expressly required vendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies  in their past performance volumes , 
and the protester’s contention otherwise is meritless.  Id . at 10.  To the extent the 
protester argues its past performance demonstrates experience “consistent with” SAFe methodologies, the agency argues this is different than meeting the solicitation’s plain requirement  to show actual experience with SAFe methodologies .  Id. at 11.   Finally, the 
agency argues that it did not require vendors to submit three examples of past 
performance, as this was contrary to the terms of the solicitation, and that it simply evaluated the examples the protester submitted.  MOL at  13; COS at 15- 16. 
 Our Office will examine an agency’s evaluation of an offeror’s past performance and experience only to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the stated 
evaluation criteria and applicable statutes and regulations, since determining the relative merit of an offeror’s past performance is primarily a matter within the agency’s 
discretion.  Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , B-417475.3, B -417475.4, Sept. 23, 2019,

2018, 2018  CPD ¶ 345 at 6 .  While we will not substitute our judgment for that of the 
agency, we will sustain a protest where the agency’s conclusions are inconsistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria, undocumented, or not reasonably based.  Conley & Assocs., Inc. , B-415458.3, B -415458.4, Apr. 26, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 161 at 5.  
 With respect to past performance, the RFQ instructed vendors t o provide up to three 
past performance examples “ that demonstrate [] experience with providing similar 
technical support” to that  required by the solicitation.  RFQ at 30.  The RFQ advised that 
the examples “should demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment’s requirement” and that the example contracts “shall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described” by the solicitation.  Id . at 33.  The examples submitted were to “provide clear 
evidence” that the vendor has demonstrated technical expertise “in all areas identified in [] [s]ection 3 [of the RFQ].”  Id .  The agency would assess an overall confidence rating 
(low, some, or high) to quotations based on its level of confidence that the vendor demonstrated it understood the requirement and showed similar past performance, and the degree to which the government had confidence that the vendor could perf orm 
without government intervention.  Id. at 34.   The RFQ did not require vendors to submit, 
or the agency to evaluate, any past performance reviews ( e.g., a past performance  Page 13    B-423190; B -423190.2   questionnaire or contractor performance assessment reports)  of the  quality of the work 
performed on the example projects.  Nor did the solicitation provide for a neutral rating 
under the past performance factor.   Accordingly, the focus of the past performance 
factor was determining whether vendors had prior experience with t he technical 
expertise needed for this procurement, and not on how well they had previously performed similar work.  
 IMTA S submitted three example projects in its past performance volume.  One of the 
projects involved IMTA S’s work under an order that was issued against the same BPA 
as the order contemplated by the solicitation here.  AR, Tab 4.3, IMTA S Past 
Performance Volume at 3- 4.  The other two examples concerned work performed by 
IMTA S’s teaming partner, WidePoint.  Id . at 5 -8.  
 In its evaluation of IMTA S’s past performance, the FBI documented three findings that 
increased confidence in the protester’s quotation, and two findings that decreased confidence.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  For the first decreased confidence finding, the agency explained that across all past performance examples, the protester did “not show experience practicing [SAFe] methodologies (or any project management methodology ),” which lowered the agency’s confidence in the protester’s 
ability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.  Id.  For the second decreased 
confidence finding, the agency found that one of the protester’s past performance examples discussing the work of its teaming partner WidePoint  involved WidePoint 
“only provid[ing] support for 7,140 devices and 5,910 users across 13 countries,” in addition to being a lower value contract than that contemplated by the solicitation.  Because the scope and value of this  example was less than the anticipated 
procurement, it  lowered the government’s confidence in the protester’s ability to meet 
the requi rements of the solicitation.  Id.  
 On this record, we find no basis to sustain the protest based on the protester’s 
argument that it should have received a higher confidence rating because the agency 
assessed more findings of increased confidence than decreased confidence to the protester’s quotation for past performance.  Similar to the evaluation criteria for the technical approach factor, the RFQ did not require the assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence and decreased confidence findings.  Accordingly, the argument that the agency acted unreasonably in 
assessing a rating of low confidence to the protester’s quotation despite the protester 
having three increased confidence findings versus two decreased confidence findings, 
without more, is meritless.
7  See Inalab Consulting, supra.   
 
7 IMTAS also contends that  the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable because it 
received a rating of low confidence despite having some experience, whereas a vendor without any relevant experience would have received a rating of neutral.  See  Protest  
at 23; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  As explained above, t he RFQ did not 
contemplate a neutral rating under the past performance factor , therefore the premise of 
the protester’s argument is without a basis.   Page 14    B-423190; B -423190.2   With regard to the protester’s challenges to the two decreased confidence findings, w e 
conclude that the FBI  evaluat ed IMTAS’s  quotation reasonabl y and consistent with the 
stated evaluation criteria.  The protester’s argument that the solicitation did not require 
vendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies is contradicted by the plain terms of the solicitation.  The RFQ required that past performance examples 
provide clear evidence that vendors have demonstrated technical expertise in all areas identified in section 3 of the RFQ; section 3 of the RFQ stat ed that the successful 
contractor “shall perform all required program management duties,” including practicing “[s]caled [a]gile [f]ramework (SAFe) methodologies during contract performance.”  RFQ at 12- 13.  The protester’s argument that demonstration of SAFe methodologies was not 
a solicitation requirement under the past performance factor is thus meritless.
8 
 
IMTA S collaterally argues that the FBI had information “too close at hand” to ignore 
concerning its past performance and experience with practicing SAFe methodologies.  
Comments & Supp. Protest at 18.  In this regard, the protester argues that the first example project it submitted, which was an order issued against the same BPA as the 
order contemplated by the procurement  here, “involved work consistent with” SAFe 
methodologies.  Id . 
 Our Office has, in certain circumstances, explained that an agency “may” consider past performance information that is “ too close  at hand” to ignore in evaluating proposals.  
VectorCSP, LLC , B-421764, B -421764.4, Sept. 27, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 229 at 9.   
However, we have declined to extend the close- at-hand line of decisions beyond the 
area of past performance so as to require an agency to consider close- at-hand 
information in the context of an experience evaluation.  Id.   Moreover, the “too close at 
hand” line of decisions is not intended to remedy an off eror’s failure to include 
information in its proposal.  Id.   Such circumstances are instead governed by the well -
established principle that offerors are responsible for submitting a well -written proposal 
 
8 To the extent the protester argues that the solicitation unreasonably required each 
vendor to “ restate its entire technical volume within the text of its past performance 
volume” to show experience practicing SAFe methodologies, we find this argument is also meritless.   Protest at 25.   Under the technical approach factor, vendors were 
required to submit a plan and approach that included a demonstration of experience practicing SAFe methodologies.  RFQ at 32.  This requirement was in addition to at least seven other enumerated areas that the agency would review under this factor.  See id . at 32- 33.  The protester’s contention that it would have to “ restate its entire 
technical volume” is thus a gross mischaracterization of the solicitation’s requirements.   
Comments & Supp. Protest at 17.   Furthermore, notwithstanding that the protester’s 
technical approach discussed the use of SAFe methodologies, it did so without specific reference to an example contract  where this expertise was demonstrated.   See AR, 
Tab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Volume at  8.  As explained above, the solicitation required 
examples of demonstrated expertise in all areas of section 3 of the RFQ (including SAFe methodologies), and even in the protester’s technical approach, specific examples of such expertise were not provided.    Page 15    B-423190; B -423190.2   with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the 
procuring agency.  Id . 
 We find IMTA S’s argument meritless for two primary reasons.   First,  the agency made a 
finding of decreased confidence because IMTAS did “not show experience” practicing SAFe methodologies on prior contracts.  The protester argues that it did have experience working with SAFe methodologies under the same overarching BPA and that it was unreasonable for the agency to “ignore this ‘close at hand’ experience.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 18.  As noted above, the “close at hand” line of decisions does not extend to information in the context of an experience evaluation.  Here, although the factor was titled  “past performance, ” the evaluation focused on vendors 
demonstrating their experience with different technical skills.  Given this, we conclude that the “too close at hand” decisions  do not apply here and the agency was not 
required to consider this experience information.  At any rate, IMTAS explained its prior experience as involving work “consistent with” SAFe methodologies .  This  is different 
than actually practic ing SAFe methodologies , which is what the solicitation required.   
 Second, the protester submitted as a past performance example the project which it claims demonstrated work consistent with SAFe methodologies.  See  AR, Tab 4.3, 
IMTA S Past Performance Volume at 3- 4.  Despite including this example and 
attempting to mirror section 3 requirements of the RFQ, the protester ’s quotation failed 
to demonstrate the required experience with SAFe methodologies , and otherwise failed 
to demonstrate in its quotation how its experience on the example project was consistent with SAFe methodolo gies.  Therefore, this was not a case of the agency 
failing to consider “close at hand” information, but instead represents the failure of the 
protester to submit a well -written quotation that allowed for meaningful review by the 
agency.  See VectorCSP, LLC,  supra.  This protest ground is denied.  
 We also find the FBI’s second decreased confidence finding ass essed to IMTA S’s 
quotation reasonable.  As explained above, the RFQ advised that the past performance examples submitted by vendors “should demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment’s requirement” and that t he 
example contracts “shall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described” by the solicitation.  RFQ at 33.  The third example submitted by IMTA S involved a contract performed by its teaming partner that the record 
demonstrates was for support of only 7,140 devices and 5,910 users --well short of the 
expected 40,000- 50,000 devices contemplated by the current order.  AR, Tab 4.3, 
IMTAS Past Performance Volume at 7; AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  Accordingly, and consistent with the evaluation criterion’s requirement that examples “shall be” similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the present  
requirement, the agency’s as sessment of a decreased confidence finding was 
reasonable.  
   
Moreover, there is nothing in the record to support IMTA S’s position that the FBI 
required three examples of past performance in order to merit a rating of some or high confidence.  The RFQ stated that vendors could submit “up to three” past performance  Page 16    B-423190; B -423190.2   examples.  The protester was therefore not required, but instead elected, to submit a 
third past performance example that fell short of the solicitation requirements for past 
performance.   In this regard, the agency made a finding of decreased confidence 
because across all three examples, IMTAS failed to demonstrate experience practicing 
SAFe methodologies.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  In addition, the agency made a decreased c onfidence finding because IMTAS’s third example was not similar in   
size, scope, and magnitude as the effort contemplated by the solicitation.  Id.   Thus, the 
record does not demonstrate that the FBI required three past performance examples in order to receive a rating of some or high confidence.  Rather, the record shows that the agency assessed a rating of  low confidence to IMTAS’s quotation because the 
quotation did not sufficiently demonstrate the required experience in a manner that was 
comparable to what is required for this procurement across all three of its example projects.  We find this reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria and deny 
this protest ground.       
  i3’s Past Performance  and Disparate Treatment   
 IMTA S also challenges the FBI’s evaluation of i3’s past performance in various 
respects.  In this regard, the protester argues that the record demonstrates that the FBI unreasonably considered information outside of the awardee’s past performance volume in eval uating the awardee’s  quotation, and that by failing to similarly consider 
information outside its own past performance volume, the agency engaged in disparate 
treatment in evaluating proposals.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3- 5.  In support of its 
argument the protester points to statements in the evaluation record under the past 
performance factor that attribute certain past performance experience to the awardee or 
its subcontractor even though the awardee or subcontractor did not perform on that respective past performance example.  The protester also contends that the agency “[i]mproperly [d]ouble- [c]ounted” an increased confidence finding with respect to one of 
the awardee’s past performance example projects.
9  Id. at 6-7. 
 The FBI contends that its evaluation o f i3’s past performance volume was reasonable 
and adhered to the solicitation’s instructions and requirements.  Supp. COS at 2.  In this 
regard, the agency explains that it “did not and could not” consider information 
contained in other volumes of the awardee’s quotation as the protester argues, because 
the solicitation precluded such consideration explaining that the solicitation provided 
 
9 The protester initially challenged the agency’s evaluation of i3’s past performance on 
the basis that the awardee could not meet the solicitations’ minimum size and scope requirements for past performance references.  Protest at 27- 28.  The agency report 
discussed the FBI’s evaluation of the awardee’s past performance in detail and specifically responded to the protester’s argument, taking the position that the awardee’s submitted examples did meet the RFQ’s requirements.  MOL at 18 -19.  The 
protester did not meaningfully respond to this particular aspect of the agency’s argument, and instead filed the supplemental protest grounds explained above.  Accordingly, we consider this aspect of the protest abandoned.  See Zin Technologies, Inc., supra.   Page 17    B-423190; B -423190.2   that:  “the [g]overnment will base its evaluation only on the information presented” in the 
vendors’ submissions.  Id .  The agency maintains that it evaluated both vendors’ 
quotations in such a manner.  Id .  With respect to the statements in the past 
performance evaluation record that form the basis of the protester ’s argument , the 
agency explains that its contemporaneous evaluation documents contained minor 
errors, but that the documents otherwise demonstrate that it evaluated the awardee’s quotation based only on information contained in the awardee’s past performance 
submission.  Id. at 3 -4.  With regard to the protester’s position that the agency 
improperly “double counted” increased confidence findings for one of the submitted projects , the agency maintains that the findings were assessed for different 
requirements in the RFQ that the agency found were reflected in the awardee’s 
performance of that project .  Id. at 7 -8.

2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 169 at 6.   Furthermore, our Office has explained that our review of 
the record is not limited to contemporaneous evidence, and that we will also consider post-protest explanations that provide a detailed rationale for contemporaneous 
conclusions , and fill in previously unrecorded details, when those explanations are 
credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Ruchman and Assocs., Inc. ,

The record demonstrates that i3 submitted three past performance examples, including one example (example 1) from its partner 3rd  Eye Technologies, Inc.  AR, Tab 5, i3 
Past Performance Volume.  The FBI documented various increased confidence findings associated with the awardee’s past performance on each of the three examples .  AR, 
Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at  9-10.  The increased confidence findings were listed in 
numerical order , by example,  to match the example numbers submitted by the awardee.  
See id .  One of the findings read:  “Example 1 –  i’3’s T[ier]3/T[ier]4 personnel assisted 
users with software, hardware.  . . .”  Id. at 9.  This finding referenced the awardee, i3, 
despite example 1 being performed by the awardee’s teaming partner, 3rd  Eye.  
Compare id. with AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5.  Another finding was 
listed in the evaluation document between the increased confidence findings labeled as 
“Example 1” and “Example 2.”  It read:  “Example 3 –  3rd Eye offers custom app 
architecture, development, testing data recovery . . . .”  Id.  This finding referenced 
“Example 3” and “3rd Eye”  despite example 3 being an i3 project, and not a 3rd Eye 
project.  Compare id.  with AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 8- 9. 
 IMTAS argues that the contemporaneous past performance record reflected that the 
agency attribut ed to i3 work performed by 3rd Eye on example 1.   Comments & Supp. 
Protest at 3- 4.  Similarly, the protester contends that the agency attributed work under 
example 3 to 3rd Eye, despite example 3 being performed by i3.   Id. at 4.  Given these 
disparities, t he protester asserts that the only way the agency could have assessed  Page 18    B-423190; B -423190.2   increased confidence findings in this regard is if the agency improperly located the 
information supporting these  findings in another part of i’3’s quotation, such as its 
technical approach, or from outside the awardee’s quotation entirely.   Id. at 5 -6.  The 
protester further asserts the agency’s treatment of the awardee’s quotation was disparate from its own, because the agency did not seek information from outside the protester’s past performance volume in evaluating the protester’s quotation.   Id. at 5.  
 In response to IMTAS’s argument, t he contracting officer explains that the awardee’s 
example 1 project was performed by its teaming partner 3rd E ye, and that i3 was not 
involved.  Supp. COS at 3.  The agency explains that the increased confidence finding in question “inadvertently left out the word ‘partner’ as the finding was intended to refer to 3rd Eye’s experience under [ e]xample 1. ”  Id.  Similarly, the agency explains that for 
the other challenged increased confidence finding, it “inadvertently mistyped Example 3 when it should have [ read]  Example 1.”  Id .  Notwithstanding these minor errors, the 
contracting officer explains that the basis of each of the underlying increased confidence findings can be readily traced to the awardee’s quotation.  Thus, contrary to the protester’s argument, the agency  contends that it  did not consider information from 
outside of i3’s past performance volume and there was no unequal treatment  of 
vendors .  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency similarly ties each of its increased confidence findings 
with respect to i3’s past performance to a section of the awardee’s past performance volume.  Id . at 4 -6. 
 On this record, w e find no basis to question the FBI’s evaluation of quotations in this 
regard and conclude that the protester has not demonstrated the agency disparately evaluated quotations.  T he agency’s post -protest explanations of the typographical 
errors in its contemporaneous documentation are reasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  For example, it is evident that for example 1, the agency intended to refer to i3’s partner, 3rd Eye.  This is supported by the two other increased confidence findings that reference 3rd Eye with respect to example 1 in the contemporaneous documentation.  See AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  Further, the substance of 
the increased confidence finding is reflected in the awardee’s quotation under the 3rd Eye example, example 1.  
   
Similarly, the FBI  reasonably explains that the erroneous reference to “Example 3”  for 
one of the increased confidence findings  should have read “Example 1.”  This is 
supported by the fact that the increased confidence findings were listed in numerical order by past performance example number , and again, because the substance of the 
finding is reflected in the awardee’s past performance volume under the 3rd Eye 
example project.  See id. ; AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5. 
 On this record, we find that IMTA S cannot demonstrate that the FBI disparately 
evaluated quotations  by considering information from outside the awardee’s quotation.   
The agency tied each of its increased confidence findings for the awardee to a relevant section of the awardee’s past performance volume.  Thus, the record belies  the 
protester’s argument that the agency must have considered information outside of the awardee’s past performance volume (that is,  by considering either information  Page 19    B-423190; B -423190.2   contained in the awardee’s  technical approach, or through the evaluators’ personal 
knowledge of i3’s previous work ).  The agency’s explanation that the evaluation record 
contained some minor errors is supported by the record.  Any difference in the ratings 
assessed to the vendors’ under t he past performance factor was thus plainly the result 
of the different content of their quotations, as documented by the agency.10 
 The record also demonstrates the FBI assessed two increased confidence findings to i3’s quotation with respect to project example 2, a previous i3 contract.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  One of the findings was specifically for the awardee’s work  
“managing cost data” for the Department of the Interior, utilizing a “cutting- edge analytic 
hub that can detect fraud[.]”  Id.  The other finding, which related to the same 
Department of the Interior contract, was assessed because of the awardee’s “ability to successfully manage the [] project, which has a contract value of nearly twice that [of the current requirement,]” and that “increase[ d] [our] confidence in i3’s ability to manage 
the [current] program.”  Id .  
 We find the FBI’s assessment of the two separate increased confidence findings to i3’s 
past performance example 2 was reasonable, and did not constitute a “double counting of strength s” as alleged by IMTAS.  The agency reasonably explains that the separate 
findings were with respect to two different aspects of the solicitation’s requirements.  Specifically, the agency explains that the RFQ contained a requirement for the 
 
10 In its supplemental comments, the protester raises  for the first time  various 
arguments concerning the increased confidence findings assessed to the awardee’s 
quotation under the past performance factor  that we find untimely .  The agency 
produced the awardee’s entire past performance volume, as well as its evaluation thereof , with its initial agency report.  The protester timely raised the arguments 
described above i n its comments and supplemental protest, however, IMTAS then 
raised additional arguments for the first time in its supplemental comments concerning the content of the increased confidence findings . 
For example, the protester argues that the awardee was assessed an increased confidence finding for its tier 3 and tier 4 personnel providing end users with troubleshooting support and response to service tickets, but that its own quotation also demonstrated these types of services yet did not receive an increased confidence finding.  Supp. Comments at 4- 5.  Our regulations do not contemplate the piecemeal 
presentation or development of protest issues through later submissions providing alternate or more specific legal arguments missing from earlier general allegations of impropriety.  CORMAC Corp , B-421532, B -421532.2, June 14, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 142 
at 4-5 n.8.  We will dismiss a protester’s piecemeal presentation of arguments that could 
have been raised earlier in the protester process.  Here, the protester knew that the agency had assessed an increased confidence finding to the awardee’s quotation for  
experience providing certain troubleshooting and end user support services when the 
initial agency report was filed, however, it chose not to challenge this  aspect of the 
finding until it filed its supplemental comments.  This amounts to piecemeal presentation of protest issues that our Office will not consider.   Page 20    B-423190; B -423190.2   contractor to perform “ [d]ata analysis for cost avoidance . . . to save FBI funding and

explained above, the agency’s evaluation of past performance considered whether the 
vendor has demonstrated technical expertise “in all areas identified in [] [s]ection 3 [of the RFQ].”  Id. at 33.   The awardee’s demonstrated experience, specifically with 
managing cost data and detecting fraud, demonstrated expertise with the cost avoida nce requirement.   
  
The agency explains that the other increased confidence finding encompassed the awardee’s demonstrated ability to “manage and administer [an] entire program,” which is different than the specific finding related to cost avoidance explained above.   Supp. 
COS at 8.   As one specific example, the agency explains that the awardee’s example 
project demonstrated experience with SAFe methodologies that are required by the current solicitation.   Id.  We find the agency’s assessment of two separate findings of 
increased confidence in this regard to be reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and find no basis to sustain the protest .

DECISION  
 Innovative Management and Technology Approaches, Inc. (IMTA S), a small business  of 
Reston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a call order to i3, LLC,  a small business  of 
Fairfax, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  MPO -TEM -SCO R-4, issued by 
the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for management  of the 
agency’s information technology enterprise,  mobile device products and data plans.   
The protester argues that the agency  unreasonably evaluated vendors’ quotations and 
that the resultant  best-value determination and source selection decision were flawed . DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423190; B -423190.2    
We deny the protest . 
 BACKGROUND  
 On September 20, 2024, the FBI  issued the RFQ to holders of the information 
technology supplies and support services (ITSSS -2) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) 
pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4.   
Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 1.
1  The solicitation contemplated the 
issuance of a call order to provide professional services “to support the [agency] in the 
management of FBI IT [information technology] mobile device products funded and supported for the enterprise[,]” with an expectation that the contractor would manage “at 
least 40,000- 50,000 mobile devices along with their inventory and carrier voice/data 
plans.”  Id .  The RFQ anticipated a 1- year base period of performance along with four 1 -
year options, and an additional 6- month option to extend services.  Agency Report  (AR), 
Tab 3.1, RFQ at  7.  
 
The RFQ advised that the FBI  intended to issue the call order to the vendor whose 
quotation represented the best value to the government, and that determination of the best-value quotation would be made using a tradeoff process.  Id. at 31.  The RFQ 
provided that in determining the best -value quotation, the agency would consider the 
following factors , listed in descending order of importance:  (1) technical approach; 
(2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id.  The solicitation stated that the agency “is more 
concerned with obtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government.”  Id. at 32.  
 The RFQ stated that for each non- price factor, the FBI  would assess one of the 
following confidence ratings:  low confidence, some confidence, or high confidence.  Id . 
at 34.  The rating was  based on the vendor’s  demonstrated ability to understand the 
requirement, whether the vendor proposed a sound approach or demonstrated  similar 
past performance to the current requirement , and the degree to which the government 
determined  the vendor could be successful in performing the requirement without 
government int ervention.  Id .   
 For the price factor, the RFQ instructed vendors  to complete a pricing template, 
including proposing labor categories necessary to meet the objectives of the solicitation and in accordance with the labor categories contained in the vendors’ underlying BPA s.  
Id. at 31;  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  For each labor category 
proposed, the template required vendors to include their  fully burdened labor rates 
(FBRs) from their underlying BPAs.   AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.   
Each vendor could then, if it desired, propose for each labor category  a percentage 
discount to the FBR to arrive at a quoted price rate for each labor category .  Id.  The 
total evaluated price would be determined by adding together the quoted price for each 
 
1 All page number citations refer to the Adobe Acrobat PDF page numbers of the 
versions of documents provided by the parties.   Page 3    B-423190; B -423190.2   labor category across the base year and all option years (including the 6- month option 
to extend services), in addition to certain fixed costs provided by the agency.  Id. at 3.    
The RFQ advised that price would be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  
RFQ at 33.  With regard to completeness, quotations would be assessed base d on their 
responsiveness in providing price data for all solicitation requirements.  To be complete, a quotation had to contain “all prices necessary to support the quote[,]” and was required to “be accurate with no mathematical error s.”  Id.    
 The FBI  received quotations from eight vendors , including IMTA S and i3.  AR, Tab 8, 
Basis of Award  at 2.  The agency ’s evaluation of quotations under the solicitation’s 
non-price factors yielded the following relevant results:  
 
 IMTA S i3 
Technical Approach  Low Confidence  High Confidence  
Corp. Experience  Low Confidence  High Confidence  
Price  $5,767,769  $6,030,960  
 Id. at 6, 7.  With respect to the price factor , the FBI evaluated IMTA S’s quotation for 
completeness and reasonableness as prescribed by the solicitation.  Though the agency determined that the protester’s total evaluated price of $5,767,769 was 
reasonable, the agency also determined that the protester’s pricing was “ incomplete. ”  
AR, Tab 7, Price Report at 3.  The agency found that one of the FBR’s on IMTA S’s 
pricing template did not match the rate in its underlying BPA across option years 1, 2, 3, 4, and the 6- month option to extend services.  Id.  Specifically, for one of t he mid- level 
database administrator positions IMTAS’s quotation identified an FBR that was $0.01-$0.02 less than the FBR from the underlying BPA.  See id.   As a result,  the FBI 
excluded the protester’s quotation from further consideration, and did not include it in its best-value tradeoff  determination.   AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 9.  
 Ultimately, the FBI selected i3 for the call order at a price of $6, 030,960.  The agency 
provided a brief notice of explanation to vendors, including IMTA S, on November 12, 
and the protester subsequently timely filed this protest with our Office.   
 DISCUSSION  IMTA S raises various challenges to the FBI’s evaluation of quotations and best -value 
tradeoff  determination.  See  Protest at 15- 29; Comments & Supp. Protest at 2 -21.  For 
the reasons explained below,  although we find that the agency unreasonably evaluated 
the protester’s price quotation, we also conclude that the protest er has not established it 
was competitively  prejudiced  in this regard and therefore deny the challenge to the price 
evaluation.  W e also deny the protester’s remaining challenges .
2 
 
2 Though our decision does not address every argument raised by the protester, our 
Office has considered all of them and find that none afford a basis on which to sustain 
the protest.   Page 4    B-423190; B -423190.2    
Price Evaluation  
 IMTA S argues that the FBI’s evaluation of the price factor was unreasonable.  As noted 
above, the agency determined that the protester’s price quotation was incomplete because the FBR for one of the labor categories did not match the labor rate in the protester’s underlying BPA.  The protester contends that this decision was unreasonabl e because the mismatched labor rate was the result of  a “$0.01 scrivener’s 
error in a single [s]chedule [r]ate” which “did not impact the total price” proposed.  Protest at 27.  Furthermore, the protester argues that the agency “had all required information to ascertain the exact amount” of its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  IMTA S additionally contends that the agency abused its discretion by not 
permitting IMTAS  to correct the issue through clarifications.   Protest at 27.  
 The FBI argues that the protester’s quotation contained a “clear and undisputable error,” and that i ts determination that the protester’s pricing was incomplete was because the 
pricing failed to meet the clear instruction and requirements of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (M OL) at 14.  The agency contends that it was due to this 
“material non- compliance in the price quotation” that the protester’s quotation was 
“removed from the competition prior to the [a]gency’s tradeoff analysis.”  Id. at 16.  
Finally, the agency argues that the solicitation did not require the agency to engage in clarifications and that, in any event, any exchanges with the protester would have resulted in quotation revisions that amounted to discussions.  Id . at 15.  
 In reviewing protests of an agency’s evaluation, we do not reevaluate quotations or 
substitute ou r judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of quotations is a 
matter within the agency’s discretion.  DigiFlight, Inc. , B-419590, B -419590.2, May 24, 
2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 206 at 5.  Rather, we will review the record to determine if the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id .  Based on our review of the 
record, we find the agency unreasonably evaluat ed the protester’s pricing and 
subsequently abused its discretion in excluding the protester’s quotation from the 
best-value tradeoff analysis .  However, as discussed below, we conclude that the 
protest er has not shown competitive prejudice with respect to this error and therefore 
decline to sustain the protest on this basis.  
 As explained above, the RFQ required vendors to complete a pricing template, which in 
part required vendors to propose labor categories and include corresponding FBRs from 
their underlying BPAs.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  In this 
regard, the solicitation stated that each vendor “shall populate the [FBR] [c]olumns [of the pricing template] to match the [vendor’s] published [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate” and that vendors could “apply discounts to the FBR by populating the [percent] in [the] [d]iscount [c]olumns [of the spreadsheet].”   Id.  The product of the FBR and any proposed discount 
represented the vendor’s “quoted rate” for a particular labor category  and accordingly 
contributed to the vendor’s total evaluated price.   See  id at 2.   
  Page 5    B-423190; B -423190.2   The agency would evaluate v endors’ pricing for completeness and reasonableness  in 
the manner described above.  RFQ  at 33.  The solicitation further contained general 
provisions permitting, but not requiring, the agency to find vendors’ quotations ineligible 
for award.  For example, the RFQ stated that “[f]ailure to comply with the solicitation requirements may result in the [vendor’s] submission being deemed ineligible for 
award[,]” and that “[f]ailure to submit the information or documentation required by [the] RFQ . . . may result in the [quotation] being deemed non -compliant and rejected by the 
[g]overnment.”  Id. at 28, 34.  
 IMTA S proposed two mid -level database administrator positions  as part of  its pricing for 
the base period of performance, each option year, and the 6- month option to extend 
services.   AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quot ation at 2.  Using the protester’s  option year 1 
data as an example,
3 the record reflects that one of these  positions listed an FBR of 
$124.89, and a proposed discount of  [DELETED]  percent; the resultant quoted price 
was an hourly  rate of $ [DELETED] .  Id.  The parties agree that  the FBR and the 
resultant quoted price for this  first position are accurate .  However, for  the second 
mid-level database administrator  position, the protester ’s quotation id entified an FBR of 
$124.88 instead of $124.89, and a proposed discount of [DELETED]  percent .  The 
resultant quoted price was a n hourly  rate of  $[DELETED] --the same quoted rate as that 
for IMTAS’s first mid -level database administrator .  Id.  The dispute here concerns the 
FBR for the second database administrator .  It is undisputed that the correct option 
year 1 FBR from the BPA  was $ 124.89, rather than $124.88--the error in the protester’s 
quotation for the option year 1 FBR was thus in the amount of $0.01.    
 The FBI determined that, though reasonable, IMTA S’s pricing was incomplete for 
“failing to provide the accurate [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate”  for one of  the mid -level database 
administrator positions  in option year 1 through the 6- month extension of services.  AR, 
Tab 7, Price Report at 3.  Although the agency completed its evaluation of IMTAS’s price quotation, due to this error, the FBI “removed [the quotation] from the tradeoff decision” and did not further consider IMTA S for the call order.  AR, Tab 8, Basis  of 
Award at 9.  
 Under these unique circumstances, we find the FBI  unreasonably determined IMTA S’s 
pricing to be incomplete.   The solicitation  established the following requirements :  
(1) vendors were required to submit pricing templates containing FBRs that matched the 
vendors’ underlying BPA rates for each labor category; (2) the quoted rate for each 
labor category , which was used to arrive at the total evaluated price,  was derived from 
the vendors’ FBR rates multiplied by any proposed discount; (3) pricing would be evaluated for completeness, including whether the quotation “provide[d] all prices 
necessary to support the quote[,] ” and was free of “mathematical errors”; and ( 4) a 
 
3 This decision uses the data from option year 1 as an example throughout.  As 
previously explained, option years 2, 3, and 4, and the 6- month option to extend 
services contained similar typographical errors  with respect to the FBR , some in the 
amount of $0.01 and some in the amount of $0.02.  See  AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price 
Quot ation at 2.  Page 6    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation that failed to provide the information required by the solicitation “may” result in 
the quotation being deemed ineligible for award.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ attach. 2 , Pricing 
Template at 1; RFQ at 33- 34. 
 
IMTA S does not dispute the fact that its quotation listed an FBR for one of its proposed 
mid-level database administrator positions  that did not match the rate on its underlying 
BPA.  Rather, the protester asserts that this error did not matter, and the FBI’s subsequent determination that its proposed pricing was incomplete was unreasonable, because the error “did not factor into the calculation of the overall quoted cost at all [,]” 
and that the agency otherwise had all of the information it needed to evaluate its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  In this regard, the protester maintains that the q uoted 
rate it provided for the labor category  in question was  ultimately  correct, so the agency’s 
focus on an error with the underlying BPA rate was misplaced.  Id .  We agree with 
IMTA S.   
 The basis of the FBI’s  finding that IMTAS’s  pricing was incomplete was that the 
protester failed to accurately  identify the underlying rates from IMTAS’s FSS BPA for 
one of its two mid -level database administrator  positions.  We find the agency’s 
determination in this regard unreasonable.   The FBR from a vendor’s BPA was not  the 
basis for the evaluation of a vendor’s price, it was the “quoted price,” and the quoted price was based on a discount from the vendor ’s FBR on its BPA.   As the protester 
explains, although one of its proposed FBRs contained a $0.01 error, its  discount rate 
adjusted by 0.01 percent arrived at the  quoted labor rate the protester intended to 
propose.   Specifically , for the first mid -level database administrator position, IMTAS  
used the correct  FBR from its BPA  of $124.89 with a [DELETED] percent discount , 
which yielded a quoted pri ce of $[DELETED] .  For the second position, with the 
“erroneous” FBR  from its BPA of $124.88 and a [DELETED]  percent discount --as the 
protester ’s pricing template provided--yield ed an identical  quoted price of $[DELETED] .  
See AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quotation at  2.     
 Importantly, the FBI was indisputably aware that IMTAS had submitted accurate pricing 
for the  other identical  mid-level database administrator position, for which the protester 
included the correct FBR of $124.89 for option year 1.
  For that line item, the protester’s 
quoted price was a rate of $[DELETED] .  The protester’s quoted price for the other 
midlevel database administrator position, in dispute here, was also $[DELETED] .  
Despite the incorrect underlying FBR, the quoted price matched that of the other mid-level database administrator position that the agency knew was accurate; t he 
protester’s mere typographical error for one of its positions thus cannot constitute a 
material omission,  where the correct information was contained within the protester’s 
quotation (on the line above the incorrect information) .  This  is particularly evident 
where the actual “quoted price,”  i.e., the price used for the evaluation, was the same for 
the identical labor categories .   
 Consistent with the terms of the solicitation, the protester’s quotation did contain “all prices necessary to support the quote” and did not contain any actual “mathematical errors .” RFQ at 33.   The agency has not alleged that it could not evaluate IMTAS’s price  Page 7    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation; in fact, the agency determined that the protester’s overall price was 
reasonable.   
 Furthermore, the solicitation did not require the FBI  to determine IMTAS’s  quotation 
ineligible, instead providing that the failure to include required  information “may” result in 
the quotation being determined ineligible for award.  See RFQ at 28, 34.   In the face of 
other pricing information for the same accurate labor category, we find the agency’s 
decision to exclude the protester’s quotation from the best -value tradeoff based on a 
$0.01 typographical error that had no impact on the protester’s overall  quoted price to 
be unreasonable.  However, because IMTAS cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice as a result of this error, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.  
 The intervenor argues that even if the agency erred in excluding IMTAS from the best -
value tradeoff, the protester cannot show prejudice because it “would still not have had a substantial chance of receiving the award because . . . its technical and past performance ratings were substantially lower than i3’s and those factors were more 
important than price.”  Intervenor Comments at 19.  We agree.  
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency ’s actions, it would have had a substantial 
chance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Cargo Transport Sys. Co. , B-411646.6, B -411646.7, Oct. 17, 
2016, 2016  CPD ¶ 294 at 9 n.14.  Based on our review of the record, IMTAS has not 
demonstrated competitive prejudice because it has not shown that it had a substantial chance of receiving award even if the agency had accepted its price quotation and 
considered its quotation as part of the best -value tradeoff.  See Orbit Research, LLC , 
B-417462, July 17, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 258, at  7. 
 The solicitation stated that the technical approach factor was more important than  the 
past performance factor and that both these factors were more important than price.  RFQ at 3 1.  The RFQ also informed vendors that the agency “is more concerned with 
obtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government”  but that the agency would not make award at a “significantly higher 
overall cost to achieve slightly superior technical skills.”   Id. at 32.   
 The agency assigned IMTAS’s quotation ratings of  low confidence --the lowest possible 
rating--to each of the non-price factors.  Although IMTAS challenges these ratings, as 
explained below, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester’s quotation as low confidence under both the technical and past performance factors.  Accordingly, IMTAS’s quotation offered the lowest ratings on the more important non- price factors 
and had a lower price than the awardee by less than five percent.  In contrast , the 
awardee i3 received ratings of high confidence--the highest possible rating--in each non-price factor with a price that was approximately  $263,200 higher than the 
protester’s price.  
  Page 8    B-423190; B -423190.2   On this record, we conclude that the protester has not established  that the agency’s 
unreasonable decision to exclude the protester from the best-value tradeoff decision 
based on the price evaluation resulted in competitive prejudice.  In this regard, even if 
the agency included IMTAS’s quotation in the best -value determination, its low 
confidence ratings and minimal cost savings  do not support a conclusion that IMTAS 
would have a substantial chance of receiving award.   The solicitation provided that the 
agency was more concerned with obtaining superior technical skills than awarding at the lowest overall price.  RFQ at 32.  Here, i3’s high conf idence ratings on both the non-
price factors indicate that its quotation demonstrated superior technical skills as compared to the low confidence ratings that IMTAS received.  Moreover, at less than a five percent premium, i3’s quotation does not represent  a “significantly higher overall 
cost” to achieve the superior technical skills.  Because IMTAS has not established that it 
had a substantial chance of receiving award even with the agency’s unreasonable price evaluation, w e deny this protest ground.
  
 Technical Approach Evaluation  
 IMTA S raises various arguments challenging the FBI’s evaluation of its quotation under 
the technical approach factor.  The protester contends that the agency’s assessment of a rating of low confidence under the factor was unreasonable because its quotation received “an equal number of areas of increased confidence and decreased confidence” that should have merited a rating of at least some confidence.  Protest at 16.  The protester also argues that each of the agency’s decreased confidence findings were inconsistent with the stated evaluation criteria or , in the alternative,  otherwise 
demonstrated by its quotation.  Id . at 16- 23. 
 The FBI argues that its evaluation of IMTA S’s technical approach was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and that the protester’s arguments amount to mere disagreement with its reasonable judgment.  M OL at 3.   The agency maintains 
that the solicitation did not require the assessment of a certain confidence rating based on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings, “bu t rather, the 
[g]overnment’s level of confidence in the [vendors’] understanding of the requirement .”  
Id.; COS at 5.  Furthermore, the agency contends that the  decreased confidence 
findings w ere not based on unstated evaluation criteria and that the protester’s 
arguments in the alternative, that the protester did meet the allegedly unstated requirements, should fail because the protester did not provide sufficient detail in its plan for meeting the requirements.  See MOL at 5 -8. 
 Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the issuance of an order, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitat ion and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  DataSavers of 
Jacksonville, Inc. , B-415113.3, Aug. 24, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 290 at 4.  Furthermore, our 
Office has consistently stated that the evaluation of proposals and the assignment of adjectival ratin gs should not be based upon a simple count of strengths and 
weaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals consistent with the  Page 9    B-423190; B -423190.2   evaluation scheme.  Perspecta Eng’g, Inc. , B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, 
2022 CPD ¶ 314 at 10.  Adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and 
not a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Id. 
 At the outset, we find that IMTA S’s argument that it should have received at least a 
rating of some confidence under the technical approach factor because its quotation was assessed an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings is meritless.  Though the protester argues i t “is difficult to conceive” how it could have 
received a rating of low confidence and that “pure logic dictates” that an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings merits at least a some confidence 
rating,  its argument is premised on the number of increased and decreased confidence 
findings the agency assessed to its quotation.  Protest at 16; Comments & Supp. 
Protest at 7.  
 Notably, here the RFQ did not prescribe the assessment of a particular adjectival rating for the non- price evaluation factors  based upon the number of increased confidence or 
decreased confidence findings that a quotation was assessed.  See  RFQ at 34.  As 
explained above, adjectival ratings reflect  a qualitative assessment of quotations, and 
the protester’s focus on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings does not establish a basis to sustain the protest where the RFQ did not require a cer tain 
confidence rating be assessed for a quotation containing a certain number increased or decreased confidence findings.  See Inalab Consulting, Inc. , B-422438 et al. , June 18, 
2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 145 at 7.  
 The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably assessed all three of the 
decreased confidence findings under the technical approach factor .  Based on our 
review of the record, we find that the agency reasonably assessed all three of the 
decreased confidence findings .  We address a representative sample.  
 The RFQ instructed vendors to provide a written approach that demonstrated their  
ability to meet the technical requirements contained in sections three and four of the RFQ.  RFQ at 30.  This approach was to include, inter alia , a plan to support the agency 
telecommunications expense management team and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  Id .  Sections three and four of the RFQ contained specific 
requirements and information relating to the data capture and analysis component of the technical approach factor .  For example, the RFQ advised that the successful 
contract or would be responsible for merging carrier data with FBI data.  RFQ at 13.   
 The FBI further clarified through solicitation questions and answers (Q&A), which were incorporated into the solicitation by amendment , certain aspects of the solicitation 
requirement concerning vendors’ approaches to improving data capture and analysis .  
See AR, Tab 3.6, RFQ Q&A.  For example, the agency advised that mobile “ [c]arriers 
provide raw data exports that are imported into FBI systems[,]” and that the successful 
contract or would “be responsible for maintaining  the relationship with carriers in support 
of the FBI.”  Id . at 2 -3.  
  Page 10    B-423190; B -423190.2   The RFQ provided that vendors’ approaches would be evaluated based on the agency’s 
level of confidence that the proposed methods would be successful, including the clarity 
of any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  RFQ  at 32.   As explained 
above, the RFQ provided that the technical approach factor would be assessed an adjectival rating of low, some, or high confidence based in part on the agency’s “confidence that the [vendor] understands the requirement” and “proposes a sound approach.”  Id . at 34.  
 IMTAS submitted its technical volume to include its approach to data capture and analysis.  In this regard, the protester described the platforms used to merge carrier data and included its approach to vendor management and support.  Specifically, the protester provided that it would “ensure vendor partnerships are effectively managed[,]” 
and that it would “have regular interactions [with carriers] to ensure dependencies are met, services levels for data extraction are maintained[,] and identify mechanisms to enhance, automate and improve the data collection in ingestion process.”  AR, Tab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Approach at 11.   The FBI assessed a decreased finding to IMTAS’s technical approach, stating that “IMTAS does not identify [a] relationship with carriers on how they will obtain raw data for ingestion which decreases confidence [to] support the [agency] and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  This lack of specificity decreases confidence as the vendor would not be able to support the specific carrier relationships.”  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 13.  
 We find no basis to question the FBI’s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in 
this regard.  The RFQ provided that vendors were required to explain their methods and submit approaches to improving data capture and analysis, as identified in the requirements section of the solicitation.  That section explained that part of the agency’s requirement involved merging carrier data with FBI data, and the questions and 
answers  clarified both that carriers would be providing the raw data, and that the 
successful contractor would be responsible for maintaining relationships with those carriers.  As the decreased confidence finding indicates, and t he contracting officer  
further  explains , the protester’s failure to demonstrate how it would maintain a 
relationship with carriers regarding data capture and analysis was the contributing basis to this decreased confidence finding.  COS at  6-7; AR Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation 
at 13.  Thus, we find the agency’s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in this 
regard was consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  
 Furthermore, we disagree with IMTAS’s argument that its quotation in fact demonstrated the required methods and approach to improving data capture and analysis through a relationship with carriers.  In response to the protest, the contracting officer indic ates that the protester’s offered approach of “ensur[ing] vendor partnerships 
are effectively managed” and “leverag[ing] structured management practices” and “participat[ing] in weekly [] program meetings” does not provide sufficient detail to demonstrate a plan for improving data capture and analysis requirements.  COS at 7.   Page 11    B-423190; B -423190.2   We have no basis to find  the agency’s conclusion in this regard unreasonable .4  
Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.5   
 
Past Performance Evaluation  
 IMTA S also  challenges the FBI’s past performance evaluation for both its own and i3’s 
quotations.   We discuss the challenges in turn below.  
 
IMTA S’s Past Performance 
 IMTA S initially contends that because it received more increased confidence findings 
(3) than decreased confidence findings  (2) under the past performance factor , the 
agency’s assessment of a rating of low confidence overall was unreasonable.  Protest at 23.  The protester also challenges the FBI’s specific decreased confidence findings  
assessed to its quotation under this factor .  In this regard, the protester alleges that the 
agency faulted the protester’s past performance submission for failing to demonstrate experience with “SAFe [m]ethodologies,”
6 despite the solicitation not specifying such 
experience as a requirement.  Id. at 24.  IMTAS  also contends that the agency had 
information “too close at hand” to ignore regarding the protester’s experience with SAFe methodologies.  Id . at 25.  Finally, the protester maintains that the agency’s assessment 
 
4 The protester also argues that it demonstrated the solicitation requirement through the 
experience of one of its key personnel, a program manager.  Protest at 17.  As with the protester’s  other argument, the agency explains that proposing this program manager 
and documenting his experience with “vendor interaction” and “vendor communications” is insufficient to show a plan and approach to improving data capture and analysis methods, and we find no basis to question the agency’s judgment in this regard.  Protest at 17; COS at 8.   
5 IMTAS also challenges the FBI’s assessment of a decreased confidence finding for 
failing to offer a plan or approach to increase efficiencies or reduce costs.  Protest at 20-23.  In response, the agency argues that IMTAS’s quotation merely regurgitated 
solicitation requirements, in violation of the solicitation instruction that vendors not 
“simply rephrase or restate” the requirements.  The contracting officer provided specific 
sections of both the RFQ and the protester’s quotation as examples of where the protester merely restated RFQ requirements.  In its comments the protester restated the 
same arguments from its protest and did not otherwise meaningfully respond to the FBI’s arguments.  We therefore find this find this aspect of the protest to be abandoned.  
See Zin Technologies, Inc. , B-422405, B -422405.2, June 13, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 154 
at 13 n.12 (dismissing protest ground as abandoned where protester failed to 
meaningfully respond to specific information provided by the agency and otherwise provided a near verbatim recitation previous arguments).  
6 “SAFe” refers to scaled agile framework , which is “an enterprise agility framework that 
helps organizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization. ”  RFQ at 9 ; IntelliBridge, LLC , B-421560.9, Aug. 8, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 188 
at 2.  Page 12    B-423190; B -423190.2   of a decreased confidence finding with respect to its third past performance example 
amounted to application of an unstated evaluation criterion, because the solicitation did not require vendors to submit three past performance examples.  Id . at 26. 
 The FBI  argues that it reasonably evaluated IMTA S’s past performance submission in a 
manner consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  T he agency maintains that the 
solicitation did not require an assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence findings, so the protester’s argument that it should have received a higher rating because it had a greater number of increased confidence findings is meritless.  MOL at 9.  
 The agency further contends that the solicitation expressly required vendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies  in their past performance volumes , 
and the protester’s contention otherwise is meritless.  Id . at 10.  To the extent the 
protester argues its past performance demonstrates experience “consistent with” SAFe methodologies, the agency argues this is different than meeting the solicitation’s plain requirement  to show actual experience with SAFe methodologies .  Id. at 11.   Finally, the 
agency argues that it did not require vendors to submit three examples of past 
performance, as this was contrary to the terms of the solicitation, and that it simply evaluated the examples the protester submitted.  MOL at  13; COS at 15- 16. 
 Our Office will examine an agency’s evaluation of an offeror’s past performance and experience only to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the stated 
evaluation criteria and applicable statutes and regulations, since determining the relative merit of an offeror’s past performance is primarily a matter within the agency’s 
discretion.  Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , B-417475.3, B -417475.4, Sept. 23, 2019,

2018, 2018  CPD ¶ 345 at 6 .  While we will not substitute our judgment for that of the 
agency, we will sustain a protest where the agency’s conclusions are inconsistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria, undocumented, or not reasonably based.  Conley & Assocs., Inc. , B-415458.3, B -415458.4, Apr. 26, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 161 at 5.  
 With respect to past performance, the RFQ instructed vendors t o provide up to three 
past performance examples “ that demonstrate [] experience with providing similar 
technical support” to that  required by the solicitation.  RFQ at 30.  The RFQ advised that 
the examples “should demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment’s requirement” and that the example contracts “shall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described” by the solicitation.  Id . at 33.  The examples submitted were to “provide clear 
evidence” that the vendor has demonstrated technical expertise “in all areas identified in [] [s]ection 3 [of the RFQ].”  Id .  The agency would assess an overall confidence rating 
(low, some, or high) to quotations based on its level of confidence that the vendor demonstrated it understood the requirement and showed similar past performance, and the degree to which the government had confidence that the vendor could perf orm 
without government intervention.  Id. at 34.   The RFQ did not require vendors to submit, 
or the agency to evaluate, any past performance reviews ( e.g., a past performance  Page 13    B-423190; B -423190.2   questionnaire or contractor performance assessment reports)  of the  quality of the work 
performed on the example projects.  Nor did the solicitation provide for a neutral rating 
under the past performance factor.   Accordingly, the focus of the past performance 
factor was determining whether vendors had prior experience with t he technical 
expertise needed for this procurement, and not on how well they had previously performed similar work.  
 IMTA S submitted three example projects in its past performance volume.  One of the 
projects involved IMTA S’s work under an order that was issued against the same BPA 
as the order contemplated by the solicitation here.  AR, Tab 4.3, IMTA S Past 
Performance Volume at 3- 4.  The other two examples concerned work performed by 
IMTA S’s teaming partner, WidePoint.  Id . at 5 -8.  
 In its evaluation of IMTA S’s past performance, the FBI documented three findings that 
increased confidence in the protester’s quotation, and two findings that decreased confidence.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  For the first decreased confidence finding, the agency explained that across all past performance examples, the protester did “not show experience practicing [SAFe] methodologies (or any project management methodology ),” which lowered the agency’s confidence in the protester’s 
ability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.  Id.  For the second decreased 
confidence finding, the agency found that one of the protester’s past performance examples discussing the work of its teaming partner WidePoint  involved WidePoint 
“only provid[ing] support for 7,140 devices and 5,910 users across 13 countries,” in addition to being a lower value contract than that contemplated by the solicitation.  Because the scope and value of this  example was less than the anticipated 
procurement, it  lowered the government’s confidence in the protester’s ability to meet 
the requi rements of the solicitation.  Id.  
 On this record, we find no basis to sustain the protest based on the protester’s 
argument that it should have received a higher confidence rating because the agency 
assessed more findings of increased confidence than decreased confidence to the protester’s quotation for past performance.  Similar to the evaluation criteria for the technical approach factor, the RFQ did not require the assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence and decreased confidence findings.  Accordingly, the argument that the agency acted unreasonably in 
assessing a rating of low confidence to the protester’s quotation despite the protester 
having three increased confidence findings versus two decreased confidence findings, 
without more, is meritless.
7  See Inalab Consulting, supra.   
 
7 IMTAS also contends that  the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable because it 
received a rating of low confidence despite having some experience, whereas a vendor without any relevant experience would have received a rating of neutral.  See  Protest  
at 23; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  As explained above, t he RFQ did not 
contemplate a neutral rating under the past performance factor , therefore the premise of 
the protester’s argument is without a basis.   Page 14    B-423190; B -423190.2   With regard to the protester’s challenges to the two decreased confidence findings, w e 
conclude that the FBI  evaluat ed IMTAS’s  quotation reasonabl y and consistent with the 
stated evaluation criteria.  The protester’s argument that the solicitation did not require 
vendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies is contradicted by the plain terms of the solicitation.  The RFQ required that past performance examples 
provide clear evidence that vendors have demonstrated technical expertise in all areas identified in section 3 of the RFQ; section 3 of the RFQ stat ed that the successful 
contractor “shall perform all required program management duties,” including practicing “[s]caled [a]gile [f]ramework (SAFe) methodologies during contract performance.”  RFQ at 12- 13.  The protester’s argument that demonstration of SAFe methodologies was not 
a solicitation requirement under the past performance factor is thus meritless.

IMTA S collaterally argues that the FBI had information “too close at hand” to ignore 
concerning its past performance and experience with practicing SAFe methodologies.  
Comments & Supp. Protest at 18.  In this regard, the protester argues that the first example project it submitted, which was an order issued against the same BPA as the 
order contemplated by the procurement  here, “involved work consistent with” SAFe 
methodologies.  Id . 
 Our Office has, in certain circumstances, explained that an agency “may” consider past performance information that is “ too close  at hand” to ignore in evaluating proposals.  
VectorCSP, LLC , B-421764, B -421764.4, Sept. 27, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 229 at 9.   
However, we have declined to extend the close- at-hand line of decisions beyond the 
area of past performance so as to require an agency to consider close- at-hand 
information in the context of an experience evaluation.  Id.   Moreover, the “too close at 
hand” line of decisions is not intended to remedy an off eror’s failure to include 
information in its proposal.  Id.   Such circumstances are instead governed by the well -
established principle that offerors are responsible for submitting a well -written proposal 
 
8 To the extent the protester argues that the solicitation unreasonably required each 
vendor to “ restate its entire technical volume within the text of its past performance 
volume” to show experience practicing SAFe methodologies, we find this argument is also meritless.   Protest at 25.   Under the technical approach factor, vendors were 
required to submit a plan and approach that included a demonstration of experience practicing SAFe methodologies.  RFQ at 32.  This requirement was in addition to at least seven other enumerated areas that the agency would review under this factor.  See id . at 32- 33.  The protester’s contention that it would have to “ restate its entire 
technical volume” is thus a gross mischaracterization of the solicitation’s requirements.   
Comments & Supp. Protest at 17.   Furthermore, notwithstanding that the protester’s 
technical approach discussed the use of SAFe methodologies, it did so without specific reference to an example contract  where this expertise was demonstrated.   See AR, 
Tab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Volume at  8.  As explained above, the solicitation required 
examples of demonstrated expertise in all areas of section 3 of the RFQ (including SAFe methodologies), and even in the protester’s technical approach, specific examples of such expertise were not provided.    Page 15    B-423190; B -423190.2   with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the 
procuring agency.  Id . 
 We find IMTA S’s argument meritless for two primary reasons.   First,  the agency made a 
finding of decreased confidence because IMTAS did “not show experience” practicing SAFe methodologies on prior contracts.  The protester argues that it did have experience working with SAFe methodologies under the same overarching BPA and that it was unreasonable for the agency to “ignore this ‘close at hand’ experience.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 18.  As noted above, the “close at hand” line of decisions does not extend to information in the context of an experience evaluation.  Here, although the factor was titled  “past performance, ” the evaluation focused on vendors 
demonstrating their experience with different technical skills.  Given this, we conclude that the “too close at hand” decisions  do not apply here and the agency was not 
required to consider this experience information.  At any rate, IMTAS explained its prior experience as involving work “consistent with” SAFe methodologies .  This  is different 
than actually practic ing SAFe methodologies , which is what the solicitation required.   
 Second, the protester submitted as a past performance example the project which it claims demonstrated work consistent with SAFe methodologies.  See  AR, Tab 4.3, 
IMTA S Past Performance Volume at 3- 4.  Despite including this example and 
attempting to mirror section 3 requirements of the RFQ, the protester ’s quotation failed 
to demonstrate the required experience with SAFe methodologies , and otherwise failed 
to demonstrate in its quotation how its experience on the example project was consistent with SAFe methodolo gies.  Therefore, this was not a case of the agency 
failing to consider “close at hand” information, but instead represents the failure of the 
protester to submit a well -written quotation that allowed for meaningful review by the 
agency.  See VectorCSP, LLC,  supra.  This protest ground is denied.  
 We also find the FBI’s second decreased confidence finding ass essed to IMTA S’s 
quotation reasonable.  As explained above, the RFQ advised that the past performance examples submitted by vendors “should demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment’s requirement” and that t he 
example contracts “shall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described” by the solicitation.  RFQ at 33.  The third example submitted by IMTA S involved a contract performed by its teaming partner that the record 
demonstrates was for support of only 7,140 devices and 5,910 users --well short of the 
expected 40,000- 50,000 devices contemplated by the current order.  AR, Tab 4.3, 
IMTAS Past Performance Volume at 7; AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  Accordingly, and consistent with the evaluation criterion’s requirement that examples “shall be” similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the present  
requirement, the agency’s as sessment of a decreased confidence finding was 
reasonable.  
   
Moreover, there is nothing in the record to support IMTA S’s position that the FBI 
required three examples of past performance in order to merit a rating of some or high confidence.  The RFQ stated that vendors could submit “up to three” past performance  Page 16    B-423190; B -423190.2   examples.  The protester was therefore not required, but instead elected, to submit a 
third past performance example that fell short of the solicitation requirements for past 
performance.   In this regard, the agency made a finding of decreased confidence 
because across all three examples, IMTAS failed to demonstrate experience practicing 
SAFe methodologies.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  In addition, the agency made a decreased c onfidence finding because IMTAS’s third example was not similar in   
size, scope, and magnitude as the effort contemplated by the solicitation.  Id.   Thus, the 
record does not demonstrate that the FBI required three past performance examples in order to receive a rating of some or high confidence.  Rather, the record shows that the agency assessed a rating of  low confidence to IMTAS’s quotation because the 
quotation did not sufficiently demonstrate the required experience in a manner that was 
comparable to what is required for this procurement across all three of its example projects.  We find this reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria and deny 
this protest ground.       
  i3’s Past Performance  and Disparate Treatment   
 IMTA S also challenges the FBI’s evaluation of i3’s past performance in various 
respects.  In this regard, the protester argues that the record demonstrates that the FBI unreasonably considered information outside of the awardee’s past performance volume in eval uating the awardee’s  quotation, and that by failing to similarly consider 
information outside its own past performance volume, the agency engaged in disparate 
treatment in evaluating proposals.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3- 5.  In support of its 
argument the protester points to statements in the evaluation record under the past 
performance factor that attribute certain past performance experience to the awardee or 
its subcontractor even though the awardee or subcontractor did not perform on that respective past performance example.  The protester also contends that the agency “[i]mproperly [d]ouble- [c]ounted” an increased confidence finding with respect to one of 
the awardee’s past performance example projects.
9  Id. at 6-7. 
 The FBI contends that its evaluation o f i3’s past performance volume was reasonable 
and adhered to the solicitation’s instructions and requirements.  Supp. COS at 2.  In this 
regard, the agency explains that it “did not and could not” consider information 
contained in other volumes of the awardee’s quotation as the protester argues, because 
the solicitation precluded such consideration explaining that the solicitation provided 
 
9 The protester initially challenged the agency’s evaluation of i3’s past performance on 
the basis that the awardee could not meet the solicitations’ minimum size and scope requirements for past performance references.  Protest at 27- 28.  The agency report 
discussed the FBI’s evaluation of the awardee’s past performance in detail and specifically responded to the protester’s argument, taking the position that the awardee’s submitted examples did meet the RFQ’s requirements.  MOL at 18 -19.  The 
protester did not meaningfully respond to this particular aspect of the agency’s argument, and instead filed the supplemental protest grounds explained above.  Accordingly, we consider this aspect of the protest abandoned.  See Zin Technologies, Inc., supra.   Page 17    B-423190; B -423190.2   that:  “the [g]overnment will base its evaluation only on the information presented” in the 
vendors’ submissions.  Id .  The agency maintains that it evaluated both vendors’ 
quotations in such a manner.  Id .  With respect to the statements in the past 
performance evaluation record that form the basis of the protester ’s argument , the 
agency explains that its contemporaneous evaluation documents contained minor 
errors, but that the documents otherwise demonstrate that it evaluated the awardee’s quotation based only on information contained in the awardee’s past performance 
submission.  Id. at 3 -4.  With regard to the protester’s position that the agency 
improperly “double counted” increased confidence findings for one of the submitted projects , the agency maintains that the findings were assessed for different 
requirements in the RFQ that the agency found were reflected in the awardee’s 
performance of that project .  Id. at 7 -8.

The record demonstrates that i3 submitted three past performance examples, including one example (example 1) from its partner 3rd  Eye Technologies, Inc.  AR, Tab 5, i3 
Past Performance Volume.  The FBI documented various increased confidence findings associated with the awardee’s past performance on each of the three examples .  AR, 
Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at  9-10.  The increased confidence findings were listed in 
numerical order , by example,  to match the example numbers submitted by the awardee.  
See id .  One of the findings read:  “Example 1 –  i’3’s T[ier]3/T[ier]4 personnel assisted 
users with software, hardware.  . . .”  Id. at 9.  This finding referenced the awardee, i3, 
despite example 1 being performed by the awardee’s teaming partner, 3rd  Eye.  
Compare id. with AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5.  Another finding was 
listed in the evaluation document between the increased confidence findings labeled as 
“Example 1” and “Example 2.”  It read:  “Example 3 –  3rd Eye offers custom app 
architecture, development, testing data recovery . . . .”  Id.  This finding referenced 
“Example 3” and “3rd Eye”  despite example 3 being an i3 project, and not a 3rd Eye 
project.  Compare id.  with AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 8- 9. 
 IMTAS argues that the contemporaneous past performance record reflected that the 
agency attribut ed to i3 work performed by 3rd Eye on example 1.   Comments & Supp. 
Protest at 3- 4.  Similarly, the protester contends that the agency attributed work under 
example 3 to 3rd Eye, despite example 3 being performed by i3.   Id. at 4.  Given these 
disparities, t he protester asserts that the only way the agency could have assessed  Page 18    B-423190; B -423190.2   increased confidence findings in this regard is if the agency improperly located the 
information supporting these  findings in another part of i’3’s quotation, such as its 
technical approach, or from outside the awardee’s quotation entirely.   Id. at 5 -6.  The 
protester further asserts the agency’s treatment of the awardee’s quotation was disparate from its own, because the agency did not seek information from outside the protester’s past performance volume in evaluating the protester’s quotation.   Id. at 5.  
 In response to IMTAS’s argument, t he contracting officer explains that the awardee’s 
example 1 project was performed by its teaming partner 3rd E ye, and that i3 was not 
involved.  Supp. COS at 3.  The agency explains that the increased confidence finding in question “inadvertently left out the word ‘partner’ as the finding was intended to refer to 3rd Eye’s experience under [ e]xample 1. ”  Id.  Similarly, the agency explains that for 
the other challenged increased confidence finding, it “inadvertently mistyped Example 3 when it should have [ read]  Example 1.”  Id .  Notwithstanding these minor errors, the 
contracting officer explains that the basis of each of the underlying increased confidence findings can be readily traced to the awardee’s quotation.  Thus, contrary to the protester’s argument, the agency  contends that it  did not consider information from 
outside of i3’s past performance volume and there was no unequal treatment  of 
vendors .  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency similarly ties each of its increased confidence findings 
with respect to i3’s past performance to a section of the awardee’s past performance volume.  Id . at 4 -6. 
 On this record, w e find no basis to question the FBI’s evaluation of quotations in this 
regard and conclude that the protester has not demonstrated the agency disparately evaluated quotations.  T he agency’s post -protest explanations of the typographical 
errors in its contemporaneous documentation are reasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  For example, it is evident that for example 1, the agency intended to refer to i3’s partner, 3rd Eye.  This is supported by the two other increased confidence findings that reference 3rd Eye with respect to example 1 in the contemporaneous documentation.  See AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  Further, the substance of 
the increased confidence finding is reflected in the awardee’s quotation under the 3rd Eye example, example 1.  
   
Similarly, the FBI  reasonably explains that the erroneous reference to “Example 3”  for 
one of the increased confidence findings  should have read “Example 1.”  This is 
supported by the fact that the increased confidence findings were listed in numerical order by past performance example number , and again, because the substance of the 
finding is reflected in the awardee’s past performance volume under the 3rd Eye 
example project.  See id. ; AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5. 
 On this record, we find that IMTA S cannot demonstrate that the FBI disparately 
evaluated quotations  by considering information from outside the awardee’s quotation.   
The agency tied each of its increased confidence findings for the awardee to a relevant section of the awardee’s past performance volume.  Thus, the record belies  the 
protester’s argument that the agency must have considered information outside of the awardee’s past performance volume (that is,  by considering either information  Page 19    B-423190; B -423190.2   contained in the awardee’s  technical approach, or through the evaluators’ personal 
knowledge of i3’s previous work ).  The agency’s explanation that the evaluation record 
contained some minor errors is supported by the record.  Any difference in the ratings 
assessed to the vendors’ under t he past performance factor was thus plainly the result 
of the different content of their quotations, as documented by the agency.10 
 The record also demonstrates the FBI assessed two increased confidence findings to i3’s quotation with respect to project example 2, a previous i3 contract.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  One of the findings was specifically for the awardee’s work  
“managing cost data” for the Department of the Interior, utilizing a “cutting- edge analytic 
hub that can detect fraud[.]”  Id.  The other finding, which related to the same 
Department of the Interior contract, was assessed because of the awardee’s “ability to successfully manage the [] project, which has a contract value of nearly twice that [of the current requirement,]” and that “increase[ d] [our] confidence in i3’s ability to manage 
the [current] program.”  Id .  
 We find the FBI’s assessment of the two separate increased confidence findings to i3’s 
past performance example 2 was reasonable, and did not constitute a “double counting of strength s” as alleged by IMTAS.  The agency reasonably explains that the separate 
findings were with respect to two different aspects of the solicitation’s requirements.  Specifically, the agency explains that the RFQ contained a requirement for the 
 
10 In its supplemental comments, the protester raises  for the first time  various 
arguments concerning the increased confidence findings assessed to the awardee’s 
quotation under the past performance factor  that we find untimely .  The agency 
produced the awardee’s entire past performance volume, as well as its evaluation thereof , with its initial agency report.  The protester timely raised the arguments 
described above i n its comments and supplemental protest, however, IMTAS then 
raised additional arguments for the first time in its supplemental comments concerning the content of the increased confidence findings . 
For example, the protester argues that the awardee was assessed an increased confidence finding for its tier 3 and tier 4 personnel providing end users with troubleshooting support and response to service tickets, but that its own quotation also demonstrated these types of services yet did not receive an increased confidence finding.  Supp. Comments at 4- 5.  Our regulations do not contemplate the piecemeal

at 4-5 n.8.  We will dismiss a protester’s piecemeal presentation of arguments that could 
have been raised earlier in the protester process.  Here, the protester knew that the agency had assessed an increased confidence finding to the awardee’s quotation for  
experience providing certain troubleshooting and end user support services when the 
initial agency report was filed, however, it chose not to challenge this  aspect of the 
finding until it filed its supplemental comments.  This amounts to piecemeal presentation of protest issues that our Office will not consider.   Page 20    B-423190; B -423190.2   contractor to perform “ [d]ata analysis for cost avoidance . . . to save FBI funding and

explained above, the agency’s evaluation of past performance considered whether the 
vendor has demonstrated technical expertise “in all areas identified in [] [s]ection 3 [of the RFQ].”  Id. at 33.   The awardee’s demonstrated experience, specifically with 
managing cost data and detecting fraud, demonstrated expertise with the cost avoida nce requirement.   
  
The agency explains that the other increased confidence finding encompassed the awardee’s demonstrated ability to “manage and administer [an] entire program,” which is different than the specific finding related to cost avoidance explained above.   Supp. 
COS at 8.   As one specific example, the agency explains that the awardee’s example 
project demonstrated experience with SAFe methodologies that are required by the current solicitation.   Id.  We find the agency’s assessment of two separate findings of 
increased confidence in this regard to be reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and find no basis to sustain the protest .

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2     B-423385   BACKGROUND  
 
On September 17, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, the agency issued the solicitation to  holders of  the Army’s Human 
Resource Solutions Recruiting, Management , and Administrative Services  multiple -
award, indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts .  Agency Report (AR), 
Tab 4, Ini tial RFP at 1.
1  The solicitation sought proposals for the provision of visitor 
operations services at Arlington National Cemetery  (ANC)  in Virginia.  Id.   The required 
services “include visitor screening at entry points  (designated gates and Welcome 
Center), visitor information assistance at key locations within the cemetery, and vehicle/pedestrian traffic control at designated locations .”  AR, Tab 22, RFP attach.  1, 
Performance Work Statement (PWS) at 1.   The solicitation provided the successful 
contractor would be required to “provide all personnel, supervision, equipment, 
materials, transportation, and non- personal services necess ary to perform” the tasks set 
out in the PWS.  Id. 
 The solicitation established that a “single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Order (TO) with cost reimbursable (CR no indirects/fee) line items for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) for a 12-month base period . . . and three 12- month option periods ” would be issued.  AR, 
Tab 23, Task Order Evaluation Plan (TOEP) at 2 .  Award would be made on a 
best-value tradeoff basis , considering a technical factor and cost/price, with the 
technical factor being significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  The technical 
factor consisted of four evaluation areas, which the solicitation specifically emphasized 
were not subfactors and would not be separately weighted.  Id. at 5.  The four 
evaluation areas were:  (1) technical approach; (2) staffing approach; (3)  management 
process; and (4) transition plan.  Id.  at 5-8.   
 Under the technical factor , the agency would assess an offeror’s understanding of the 
requirements , the completeness and adequacy of the offeror’s response, and the 
feasibility of the offeror’s proposed approach .  AR, Tab 23, TOEP  at 11.  The evaluators 
would assign an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable for the technical factor , and also would assess technical risk.  Id.  at 11- 12.  
Price would be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.  Id.  at 14.  
 The agency received three proposals, including those submitted by the protester and 
awardee, Qi2.  AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision (SSD) at 1.   The Army 
established a competitive range that included all three offerors, and the agency conducted discussions with all three.  Id. at 3.  After reviewing offerors ’ discussion 
responses and revised proposals, “the Government identified the need to re- open 
discussions.”  Id.  The Army conducted a second round of discussions , after which final 
revised proposals  were submitted by all three offerors.  Id.   The agency assessed the 
protester’s and awardee’s final proposals as follows:

Technical Factor  Good  Outstanding  
Price   $32,144,684  $37,859,757  
 
Id. at 4.   
 The source selection authority ( SSA) conducted a tradeoff between BEI’s proposal, 
which was the lowest -priced of the three offers received, and Qi2’s higher technically 
rated proposal, which was the highest -priced of the three offers received.   AR, Tab 45, 
SSD at 8.  In conducting the tradeoff, the SSA acknowledged various meritorious 
aspects of BEI’s proposal, but also noted the proposal was assessed a significant weakness due to concerns that it did not include sufficient labor hours, resulting in a significant risk to performance.  Id. at 10-11.  The SSA found that while BEI “submitted 
the proposal with the lowest [price], the Offeror presents a less advantageous technical approach due to the inherent risks associated with the Significant Weakness.”  Id. at 11.   
In contrast, the SSA concluded Qi2’s “technical proposal is superior to all other offerors and provides the Government with the highest degree of confidence of successful task order performance.”  Id.  The SSA detailed a number of  advantages offered by Qi2’s  
proposal  that warranted payment of its  associated price premium , while still being below 
the independent government estimate (IGE) and “within the Government’s budget constraints.”  Id. at 11-12. 
 After being notified of the award decision and receiving a debriefing, BEI filed this 
protest with our Office.

DISCUSSION 
 As noted above, the evaluators assessed a significant weakness in the protester’s proposal because BEI did not propose sufficient labor hours to meet all the PWS requirements.  The protester challenges the agency’s conduct of discussions with 
regards to the significant weakness , as well as the underlying assessment of the 
weakness .  For the reasons explained below, we deny BEI’s challenges .  While we do 
not address every argument, or permutation thereof, raised by the protester, we have considered them all,  and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.

2 The value of the protested task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is 
within our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under defense agency IDIQ contracts.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B). 
3 For example, BEI contends the agency erred in not assessing one additional strength 
and two additional significant strengths in the firm’s proposal  related to the protester’s 
retention plan, transition plan, and personnel, respectivel y, the assessment of  which, 
the protester maintains, would have resulted in BEI’s proposal being assigned the 
highest adjectival rating of outstanding--rather than a rating of good--for the technical factor .  Protest at 33- 37.  In its comments on the agency’s report responding to the 
(continued...)   Page 4     B-423385   Significant Weakness  
 
Relevant to the significant weakness at the heart of BEI’s protest, are the solicitation’s staffing requirements and staffing approach evaluation criteria.   With respect to staffing, 
the solicitation require d the successful contractor to provide all necessary personnel to 
perform three categories of visitor operations services --visitor screening, visitor 
information assistance, and vehicle/pedestrian traffic control.  PWS at 40.   Personnel 
will be required to perform these services at both fixed posts and roving posts.  Id.  The 
solicitation set out  the post positions in PWS t echnical exhibit 4, which showed there 
were 43 posts to staff during the half of the year considered “summer months”  and 38 
posts to staff during the winter months.   Id. at 40, 71; Protest at 180 (Protest exh. A, 
RFP Questions and Answers at Q.  No. 2) .
4  In addition to specifying the posts to be 
 
protest, BEI withdrew  it contention that the evaluators should have assessed a strength 
for the protester’s proposed retention plan.  Comments at 33 n.19.   For the two 
remaining allegations of significant  strengths  the protester argues the agency 
improperly failed to assess , the crux of the protester’s contentions  is that BEI exceeded 
the RFP’s requirements  by having the incumbent contractor as part of its  team , by virtue 
of which BEI was able to offer a “ seamless transition” and personnel with experience 
working on the incumbent contract .  Protest at  36, 38- 39.   
An agency’s judgment that the features identified in a proposal do not exceed the requirements of a solicitation or provide advantages to the government warranting assessment of a strength is a matter within the agency’s discretion, which we will not disturb unless a protester shows the evaluation was unreasonable.  Assessment and 
Training Solutions Consulting Corp. , B-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 177 at 15.  Here, the protester has not made such a showing, and t he record provides 
no basis for us to question the evaluators’ judgment that neither BEI’s transition plan nor 
its personnel merited the assessment of additional significant strengths in the 
protester’s proposal.  For instance, the record shows the evaluators specifically noted 
BEI’s “proposal describes in detail their personnel with qualified experience,” but 
concluded BEI’s proposal in this respect met “the requirements in the staffing approach area.”  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 11.    
Although BEI may consider aspects of its proposal to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis 
on which to sustain the protest .  See e.g., CACI, Inc.--Federal , B-420729.2, Mar. 1, 
2023, 2023 CPD ¶  51 at 9 (denying allegation that proposal merited additional strengths 
where protest submission and contemporaneous evaluation record demonstrated only 
that protester “holds a different opinion from the evaluators” about the proposal).   Nor 
does the BEI team’s incumbency status entitle it to higher ratings or provide any basis 
for finding the evaluation unreasonable.  Pricewater houseCoopers Public Sector, LLP ,

For all three types of services --screening, information assistance, and traffic control -- 
the solicitation require d the contractor to “maintain the appropriate number of personnel 
without vacancies to ensure” effective performance, and cautioned  that “no position 
shall remain vacant longer than five days without approval of the” agency.  PWS at 17.  Further, the solicitation indicated posts  that “shall not be self -breaking,” meaning 
“contractor personnel performing screening services in these positions shall remain at their designated area of responsibility at all times until relieved by another qualified contractor ” personnel.  Id. at 40- 41; see also at 44.    
 The solicitation established the normal operating hours for Arlington National Cemetery 
as 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day, and that funerals are conducted Monday  through 
Saturday .  PWS at 6-7.  The solicitation explained that the cemetery receives over 3 
million visitors a year, conducts approximately 7,000 funerals a year, and “over 3,400 other ceremonies such as commemorations, wreath ceremonies, and head- of-state 
visits” each year.  Id.  at 1.  The solicitation required  the provision of additional surge 
personnel , beyond the number needed to staff the regular posts , on an as needed basis 
for events  or holidays .  Id. at 42.    
 For evaluation of the staffing approach area, the solicitation required each proposal to provide “[a] detailed explanation of the Offeror’s staffing methodology ,” to include the 
“basis for calculating annual productive hours.”   AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 6 -7.  Specific to 
labor hours, the solicitation stated:  “If the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical hours/labor, the Offeror shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of t his variance.”   Id. 
at 7.  With respect to technical exhibit 3 , while it  was “not a Government required level

 The record reflects the agency’s evaluation was informed by the level of “historical support required” to perform the requirement .  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical 
Evaluation at 13.  Additionally, the record shows to aid in its comparison of offerors’ proposed staffing levels with historical staffing levels, the agency prepared an independent government estimate (IGE), which estimated a need for 10 0 full -time

The protester challenges the agency’s conduct of discussions related to the significant weakness assessed in BEI’s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  The protester 
contends the agency failed “to conduct meaningful discussions” about the significant weakness.  Protest at 17.  The protester maintains the Army failed “to provide sufficient information to allow BEI to understand the aspects of its staffing plan that the Agency found problematic so as to provide a reasonable opportunity to address those aspects and be competitive for award.”  Id.   The agency responds that “[d]iscussions were 
conducted appropriately and provided BEI with sufficient information allowing them to correct a significant weakness.”  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of 
Law ( COS/MOL ) at 13- 14.  We agree.  
 The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement at issue here.   M.A. 
Mortenson Co. , B-413714, Dec. 9, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶  361 at 8.  In this regard, section 
16.505 of the FAR does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order competition; nonetheless, when an agency conducts exchanges with offerors in a task order competition, those exchanges  must be fair , meaningful,  and not misleading.   
Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc. , B-419271.5 et al. , Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  191 
at 10-11.  In the context of both FAR part 15 and 16 procurements, our decisions have 
explained that for discussions to be meaningful  an agency need not “spoon- feed” an 
offeror as to each and every item that could be revised to improve an offeror’s proposal.  Abacus Tech.  Corp.; SMS Data Prods. Group, Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 2016, 
2016 CPD ¶  317 at 7 .  Rather, agencies  need only lead offerors into the areas of their 
proposals that require amplification or revision.   Id.; Engility Corp. , B-413120.3 et al. , 
Feb. 14, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  70 at 6.   Further, the exact content of discussions largely is 
a matter of the contracting officer’s judgment.  Id. at 8. 
 Relevant here, the record shows that during the second round of discussions, the agency issued BEI an evaluation notice (EN) that identified a significant weakness.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.  The EN stated:  “The Offeror proposes labor hours that are 
insufficient to provide the tasks listed in the PWS.”  Id.   The EN explained:  
 
The Offeror’s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take in account planed and unplanned vacancies/absences.  
 Insufficient staffing reflects a lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  
  Page 7     B-423385   Id.  The EN then advised:  “Failure to address this finding will likely impact the offeror’s 
proposal rating when re- evaluated.”  Id. 
 
In response, BEI represented:  “After a thorough review of our proposed staffing model, 
BEI has determined that we have provided adequate staffing to ensure each position/  
post is staffed 100 [percent]  of the time in accordance with the Performance Work 
Statement (PWS) requirements and that we did take into account planned and unplanned vacancies/absences.”  AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Resp onse at 2.  BEI then 
went on to explain how it developed its proposed labor hours.  See id. generally at 2- 4.  
The protest er concluded its response to the EN with the following assertion:  
 
BEI has proposed adequate hours for all proposed posts during full years (option periods).  Since BEI took a [DELETED]  approach to staffing that 
ensured each post was staffed at 100 [percent] , BEI has taken into 
account planned and unplanned vacancies/absences. . . .  Any additional 
hours would unnecessarily increase the cost to the government.  
 Id. at 4.  In short , BEI answered the EN by explaining the basis for its proposed labor 
hours, but chose not to increase its labor hours in response to the evaluators’ concern 
they were insufficient . 
 The evaluators found BEI’s response unconvincing, noting:  
 
In reviewing the Offeror’s proposal revision, the Offeror addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient 
Proposed Labor Hours).  Upon review of the Offeror’s final proposal submission, the previously identified significant weakness was not adequately resolved.  
 
AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9.  As a result, the agency assessed a significant weakness to BEI’s final proposal under the staffing approach area of the 
technical factor .  Id.  In addition to the significant weakness, BEI’s final proposal was 
assessed one significant strength and one strength, which resulted in the assignment of 
an overall rating of good for the technical evaluation factor .  Id. at 2, 9.  
 With respect to the significant weakness, the Army  found that BEI had continued to 
propose insufficient labor hours.  Specifically, the evaluators concluded:  
 
During the second round of discussions, the offeror provided an EN response for this finding that identified the Offeror did not take planned and unplanned vacancies/absences into account in their previous 
proposal submission.  The Offeror provided a detai led EN response that 
explained how they calculated their proposed hours.  However, there is 
significant risk to the Government based on the fact that the Government will not know if a post is manned (due to call outs/unplanned vacancies) under their staffi ng plan because the personnel are only responsible for  Page 8     B-423385   the hours they are on post.  The proposal does not address roll call or the 
inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post.  The Government would only find out about these issues when it is time to staff the post or upon notification from the employee that they are calling out and then have to scramble to get someone on site from the other s hift, 
or flex someone to cover their post from another post within ANC.  
 The Offeror’s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take into account the required pre and post shift tasks associated with contractor employee’s daily shifts.  
 Insufficient staffing reflects lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  
 Id. at 12- 13. 
 In support of its contention that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions, the protester first claims that “the Final Technical Evaluation Report concedes that BEI ‘addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient Proposed Labor Hours)’ but, nonetheless, identified a Significant Weakness in BEI’s 
Staffing Approach.”  Protest at 23.  Here, t he protester’s claim --that the evaluators 
considered BEI’s EN response sufficient to address the significant weakness --rings  
especially hollow given that the very next sentence in the final evaluation report  
unequivocally states,  “the previously identified significant weakness  was not adequately 
resolved. ”  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9 (emphasis added).   
 
The protester further compounds its selective reading of the agency’s evaluation by asserting next that the Army  “continues to couch its finally assigned Significant 
Weakness as a problem with BEI’s proposed labor hours, [but] the Agency’s actual 
concern appears to be” something else that was not conveyed to BEI during discussions.  Protest at 23.  Specifically, the protester contends “the Agency’s actual concern appears to be that BEI’s ‘proposal does not address roll call or t he inherent 
tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post,’ which could lead to late breaking changes in the specific personnel that may be available to perform on any given day and BEI ‘scrambl[ing]’ to adjust.”  Id. (citing AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical 
Evaluation at 12.  In this connection, t he protester contends :   
 
That concern is not tied to the number of labor hours BEI, or any other offeror, proposes to perform “the tasks listed in the PWS,” however, as personnel may call out of work on short notice and otherwise must get to work to perform “the tasks listed in the PWS” regardless of how many  Page 9     B-423385   labor hours an offeror proposed to provide.  Indeed, “the tasks listed in the 
PWS” do not include, for example, personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work such that it is patently unreasonable to expect any proposal to address “the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post” let alone to imagine that offerors would 
account for such time in pricing their proposals.  
 Protest at 23.  The protester characterizes the agency’s EN as “vague,” maintaining that it “did not provide sufficient information for BEI to understand that it needed to address ‘roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/t ransported to 
post’ to be competitive for award.”  Id.    
 As an initial matter, we note the protester’s interpretation of the evaluation’s reference to “inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post” as  equating 
to “personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work” is a fallacy premised on a false equivalency drawn from the language of the evaluation report.  When read in 
context with the preceding sentence’s stated concern that “personnel are only responsible for the hours they are on post,” it is clear the evaluators’ reference to there being insufficient hours to account for “inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post” relates to various pre- shift and post -shift tasks an employee will 
need to attend to at the cemetery outside of the normal  operating hours of 8:00 a.m. to 
5:00 p.m.  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 13; PWS at 6 (specifying the 
cemetery’s normal operating hours) ; see also id. at  41-48 (PWS sections 5.1.1.1, 
5.1.1.2, 5.1.3.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.10, 5.2.10.6, 5.2.12, 5.2.13, 5.2.14, 5.3.1.1, 5.4.1.2, 5.3.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.5.1, 5.5 specifying that various posts are required to be staffed during 
the entirety of the cemetery’s normal operating hours).   
 
The agency explains that “[t]he PWS includes descriptions of the pre and post operational hour tasks in multiple areas,” and that ensuring suffici ent labor hours to 
account for these tasks was “not reflected in BEI’s response to the EN” because “the proposed hours were based on an 8am start time.”  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 5 -6.  For example, section 5.7 of the PWS requires contractor personnel 
to perform daily checks of both government -furnished and contractor -furnished 
screening equi pment to ensure the equipment is fully operational , and the PWS task  
estimates some of these checks may take approximately 20 minutes .  PWS at 49 -50; 
see also AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 5 (proposing to “Perform/ensure 
[DELETED]. ”) and at 6 (similarly proposing to  perform [DELETED] related tasks ).  The 
agency acknowledges that BEI’s response to the EN showed “hours proposed for 
Visitor Screeners were based on 9 hours daily (8am - 5pm hours of operation IAW [in 
accordance with] PWS 5.1.1.1 and 5.1.1.2) ,” with additional hours  proposed “for 
‘[DELETED] ,’” but the evaluators found that BEI  still made “no mention of pre- shift 
preparation  or roll up of personnel to assume post positions by the 8am ANC opening 
time as a factor in BEI’s calculation of hours .”  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair 
Decl. at 6.  
  Page 10     B-423385   As another example, some of the post locations necessitate contractor personnel 
opening and closing access doors or other access points prior to the start of and after 
the end of a shift, respectively.  See e.g., PWS at 44-46 (§§ 5.2.10, 5.2.12).  A further 
example, is the PWS’ s description of “a significant amount of equipment, to include 
weather -conditional items which may need to be set -up, taken down, and stored daily 
such as umbrellas, tents, heaters, fuel, fans , folding chairs, and outdoor screening 
equipment ,” for which the pre -shift and post -shift set -up and take- down time “can be 
significant , especially considering the time it takes to transport personnel and 
equipment/supplies to the geographically dispersed post positions” throughout the cemetery.   AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 6 (citing PWS at  37-38).  
While not an exhaustive recitation of the PWS sections that set forth various “inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post,” these examples serve to highlight the disingenu ous nature of the protester’s contention that it could not have 
understood from the discussions EN that the agency wanted BEI ’s proposal  to include 
labor hours for “personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work.”  Protest at 23.    Turning to BEI’s contention that the EN was vague and failed to provide sufficient information about the specific areas for which the firm needed to provide additional labor hours, we find the protester’s contention unavailing.  The protester maintains that if “the Agency shared its actual areas of concern, BEI could and would have discussed ‘roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post’ through additional explanation in its proposal and/or by increasing prop osed labor 
hours to alleviate the Agency’s concerns.”  Protest at 24.    
 
Contrary to the protester’s argument, the record reflect s the EN provided to BEI made 
clear that the evaluators did not believe the protester’s proposal included sufficient labor hours to perform all the PWS tasks.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at  1.  The record also 
shows the final evaluation report further elucidates the agency’s concerns  by including  
examples of why the evaluators did not consider BEI’s proposed hours sufficient  (e.g., 
coverage of incidental tasks) .  Compare AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1 with Tab AR, 
Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 12- 13.  While the agency could have 
discussed these more granular level examples with BEI, there was no requirement that the Army engage in such “spoon -feeding, ” and we will not substitute our view for 
matters within the contracting officer’s judgment.   See e.g., Engility Corp., supra at 9 
(denying discussions challenge where agency could have discussed additional areas of 
concern with protester’s proposal, but was not required to do so).  
 Our review of the record finds that t he agency ’s discussions properly led BEI to the area 
of concern with its proposal --i.e., insufficient labor hours to perform all PWS tasks.  
Further, the agency specifically cautioned, during discussions,  that “[f]ailure to address 
this finding will likely impact the offeror’s proposal rating when re -evaluated.”   AR, 
Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.   In response to the EN, BEI made a business judgment to not 
increase the number of labor hours proposed , but to instead explain why it disagreed 
with the evaluators’ assessment that the proposed hours were insufficient.  See generally AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.  Ultimately, it was t he protester’s  Page 11     B-423385   business judgment to leave unchanged BEI ’s proposed level of staffing that resulted in 
the negative evaluation, not discussions.  Accordingly, we deny BEI’s challenge to the 
agency’s conduct of discussions.  See e.g., Abacus  Tech. Corp.; SMS Data Prods. 
Group, Inc., supra at 9 (denying discussions challenge where agency led protester to general area of concern--staffing level for base period--and was under no obligation to 
provide any additional guidance or proposal direction).  
 
Assessment of Significant Weakness  
 In addition to protesting about the agency ’s conduct of discussions , the protester 
directly challenges , as unreasonable,  the assessment of the significant weakness in 
BEI’s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  T he protester contends the 
assessed weakness is “irrational” and “flawed .”  Protest at 24.  Specifically, the 
protester maintains  the evaluators unreasonably assessed the weakness because:   
(1) “historical staffing levels do not provide a valid comparison because the incumbent 
contract required more labor hours than the instant effort”; (2) “the Agency imposed unstated evaluation criteria i n concluding that additional labor hours are required for 
certain pre-  and post -duty tasks which are not identified in the PWS”; (3) “the Agency 
ignored critical information in BEI’s proposal that directly addresses the Agency’s concerns”; and (4) “BEI proposed significantly more hours than required based on the 
positions and tasks identified in the PWS .”
6  Id. at 24- 25.  The agency responds that 
BEI’s protest “merely argues with the evaluation results,” and that such “mere disagreement with the agency’s evaluation does not demonstrate that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.”  COS/MOL at 25.  We agree.  
 
As stated above, the task order competition here was conducted pursuant to FAR 
subpart 16.5. The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a 
matter within the contracting agency ’s discretion, because the agency is responsible for 
defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them. Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc. , supra at 7.  In reviewing protests of an award in a task order competition, 
we do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation ’s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.   
CACI , Inc.-- Federal, supra at 7.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment 
of the relative merit of competing proposals, without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Id. ; Engility Corp., supra at 4-5.  
   Use of Historical Staffing Levels in Evaluation of Proposals  
 Relevant here, t he IGE estimated a need for 10 0 FTEs to staff the contract.  AR, 
Tab 50, IGE at  1.  The record shows BEI’s proposal offered [DELETED]  FTEs , and was 
assessed a significant weakness  for proposing insufficient labor hours .  AR, Tab 32, BEI 
 
6 The protester raises additional ancillary arguments  challenging the assessed 
significant weakness as unreasonable.  While not addressed in our discussion, we have 
considered each of these ancillary arguments and find them all to be without merit.   Page 12     B-423385   Final Technical Proposal at 13; Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9, 12- 13.  In 
challenging the reasonableness of this  significant weakness , the protester  takes aim at 
the IGE, arguing it is “vastly overinflated, likely because it appears the Agency based its 
estimates on the expanded but now outdated requirements from the incumbent 
contract.”  Comments at 13.    
 The protester argues  the agency’s use of historical staffing levels as part of the 
evaluation was unreasonable because those “levels do not provide a valid comparison” to “the instant effort .”  Protest at 24- 25.  The protester points out that the incumbent 
contractor is part of BEI’s team, and the firm represents that this provides “Team BEI” with “firsthand knowledge” and “an intimate understanding of the staffing levels and skill 
sets required.”  Id. at 26 -27.  Similarly, the protester claims , “the BEI te am has unique 
insight  into the labor hours required for successful performance,” and that it “reasonably 
drew” on this “firsthand knowledge of staffing levels as the incumbent to develop its efficient and realistic proposed level of effort.”  Id.  at 27.   Further, the protester 
maintains “the solicitation for the incumbent contract required lengthier hours at each post and a different labor mix as the basis for estimate for the required hours, so the total number of hours on the incumbent contract is mark edly greater than required to 
perform the scope of work under the current Solicitation.”  Id.   
   
Our Bid Protest Re gulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a 
solicitation that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1).   Our timeliness rules reflect the dual 
requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.   
Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 260 at 4.  To this 
end, a protester may not wait until after award has been made to protest alleged flaws in the procurement’s ground rules that are apparent prior to submission of proposals.  Microsoft Corp., B -420004, B -420004.2, Oct. 29, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 155 at 30.  
 Here, as discussed above, the solicitation included as t echnical exhibit 3  visitor trends , 
workload estimates , and stated that while this exhibit did not establish a required level 
of effort  “any proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, and in sufficient enough 
detail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government’s requirements.”  AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 7.   More directly, the solicitation’s evaluation methodology  provided:  
“If the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical  hours/labor, the 
Offeror shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of this variance.”  Id.   Thus, the solicitation squarely placed 
offerors  on notice that the agency intended to use “historical hours/labor” as a 
benchmark for assessing proposals.    
 If, as expressed in its protest, BEI did not believe that historical staffing levels represented an accurate comparison point for the solicited requirement , the firm was 
required to raise that concern prior to the time set for receipt of proposals.   Having 
waited to protest this issue until after the time set for receipt of proposals and after 
award, BEI’s argument arising from this alleged solicitation impropriety is dismissed as  Page 13     B-423385   untimely .7  See e.g., Microsoft Corp., supra at 30; Facility Healthcare Servs., Inc. , 
B-418743.2, B -418743.3, Sept. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 313 at 7 n.4 (dismissing as 
untimely post -award argument that comparing proposed prices to IGE was not an 
adequate evaluation method where solicitation informed offerors such an evaluation 
could take place).  
   Unstated Evaluation Criteria 
 In addition to challenging the accuracy of the IGE used by the agency as a comparative evaluative benchmark, the protester contends the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by downgrading BEI’s proposal for not addressing “required pre and post shift 
tasks”  that are “not actually specified in the Solicitation.”   Protest at 27 -28.  Contrary to 
the protester’s contention, however, and as detailed above, the PWS  included a variety 
of pre- shift and post -shift tasks--e.g., daily equipment checks, opening and closing 
access to certain parts of the cemetery, etc.   Accordingly, we find no merit in BEI’s claim 
that the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by expecting offerors to propose sufficient staff to perform all the tasks set forth in the PWS.  See e.g., CAE USA, Inc. , 
B-421550 et al. , June 22, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 149 at 7 (denying protest allegation that  
assessment of protester’s staffing used unstated evaluation criteria where the language of the solicitation belied protester’s argument).  
   Proposal Information and Sufficiency of Proposed Labor Hours  
 The protester further argues that BEI’s proposal did, in fact, address the agency’s 
concerns related to pre- shift and post -shift tasks by offering “more hours than required 
by the normal duty hours” to be “more than sufficient to cover” these various activ ities.  
Protest at 30.  Speci fically, the protester claims , “BEI proposed significantly more hours 
than required,” and characterizes the assessed weakness as “unjustified and, frankly, baffling.”  Id.  at 24-25.  In support of this contention, the protester  explains how it 
calculated the number of labor hours needed, and insists  its methodology resulted in 
BEI proposing hours that were “roughly  [DELETED] higher than the Government’s 
stated requirement.”  Id. at 26.  The explanation provided in BEI’s protest, however, is 
simply a summation of the explanation included in BEI’s proposal and responses to 
discussion ENs .  Compare id. with AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13- 14; 
see also generally  Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.   
 In this  connection, BEI ’s explanation describes how the firm  calculated the number of 
hours required for each post to be continuously staffed  during the cemetery’s operating 
hours  of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m .  For example, for the visitor screener posts, BEI made 
 
7 Although we need not address the merits of this argument, we note the agency 
presented a detailed rebuttal of the protester’s claim that the IGE is inaccurate.  The Army explained that while the incumbent task order, as initially awarded, did require longer hours at various posts, the order was later modified to reduce the “hours of operation to those reflected in the current PWS.”  Supp. COS/MOL at 2; see also generally AR, Tab 56, Supp. Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 1- 2.

posts to staff and a second calculation for the 182 days of the winter months when there 
are 14  posts to staff.  AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13.  BEI  added 
[DELETED] FTE [DELETED],  resulting in [DELETED] positions  to staff in the summer 
and [DELETED]  in the winter.  Id.  For each season’s calculations, BEI multiplied 
9 hours per day by 183 or 182 days , multiplied that by the number of posts for the 
summer and winter months, then added the two figures to reach a total number of [DELETED]  hours --or [DELETED] FTEs --needed to staff each of the visitor screener 
posts for exactly 9 hours per day.
8  Id. at 13-14.  BEI ’s proposal also included additional 
hours for [DELETED] , but those hours were specified for those purposes and were not 
represented as being available for the performance of pre- shift or post -shift tasks or 
covering for employee breaks.  Id. at 14.  
 As noted in our assessment of the protester’s discussions challenge, the record shows 
the evaluators considered the basis for BEI’s labor hour estimate that was included in 
the firm’s proposal and discussions response, and, notwithstanding these explanations , 
found the proposed hours insufficient.  Based on the record before us, we find 
imminently reasonable the evaluators’ judgment  that BEI’s approach of providing 
enough FTEs to staff posts for exactly 9 hours per day , without provision for pre-shift 
and post -shift duties outlined in the PWS, and with minimal staffing to cover breaks  
failed to provide the amount of support needed to perform the contract , warranting 
assessment of a significant weakness.  While BEI has expressed its disagreement with the evaluators’ judgment in myriad arguments throughout its protest, BEI has not shown 
that the evaluation was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.
9  Accordingly, 
 
8 Summer ( 9 hours per day * 183  days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) + 
Winter (9 hours per day * 182 days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) = Total 
Annual Hours of [DELETED]  divided by [DELETED]  annual hours per FTE = 
[DELETED]  FTEs .  AR, tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at  13-14. 
9 Among the protester’s myriad arguments, is BEI’s assertion that the assessed 
significant weakness is unreasonable because it “resulted from a cursory, mechanical 
comparison of bottom -line numbers between BEI’s proposed labor hours and the IGE.”  
Comments at 23.  The protester claims “the Agency’s cursory review showed that BEI’s bottom -line numbers were below the IGE, and so, the Agency contrived generic reasons 
as to why that is problematic.”  Id.  at 24.  The record does not support such a finding.  
Rather, as detailed above, the record shows the evaluators fully considered the information in BEI’s proposal and discussions response, and detailed in the contemporaneous evaluation record why that inf ormation was not sufficient to alleviate 
concerns about the insufficiency of BEI’s proposed labor hours.   
To the extent, the protester’s c ontention that the evaluators “contrived generic reasons” 
for assessing a significant weakness in BEI’s proposal can be construed as an allegation of bad faith, we find such an allegation meritless.  As a general matter, government officials are presumed to act in good faith, and a protester’s contention that procurement officials were motivated by bias or bad faith must be supported by

 Finally, t he protester argues that the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision was 
improper because it was based on a flawed technical evaluation.

This allegation is derivative of the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation of

There is no indication that the Agency properly considered the lower price 
and numerous unique strengths associated with BEI’s proposal as compared to the awardee’s proposal in making the award decision, 
however .  Nor does the record provide a rational explanation as to the

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest challenging conduct of discussions as not meaningful  is denied where  
agency informed protester its labor hours were insufficient, protester chose not to adjust its labor hours, and the final evaluation reflects a more detailed rationale for the stated concern--insufficient labor hours --not an unrelated and undisclosed concern, as claimed 
by protester . 
 2.  Protest challenging assessment of a significant weakness in protester’s staffing 
approach is dismissed in part as an untimely challenge to the terms of the solicitation.  
Remaining protest allegations are denied where the evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the solicitation.    
DECISION  
 Brandan Enterprises, Inc. (BEI), a small business of Knoxville, Tennessee, protests the issuance of a task order to Quality Innovation, Inc. (Qi2), a small business of Austin, Texas, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W15QKN -24-R- 0099, issued by the 
Department of the Army for visit or operations services at Arlington National Cemetery.  
The protester challenges the conduct of discussions, evaluation of BEI’s proposal, and the resulting best -value tradeoff source selection decision.  
 We deny the protest.   
   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2     B-423385   BACKGROUND  
 
On September 17, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, the agency issued the solicitation to  holders of  the Army’s Human 
Resource Solutions Recruiting, Management , and Administrative Services  multiple -
award, indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts .  Agency Report (AR), 
Tab 4, Ini tial RFP at 1.
1  The solicitation sought proposals for the provision of visitor 
operations services at Arlington National Cemetery  (ANC)  in Virginia.  Id.   The required 
services “include visitor screening at entry points  (designated gates and Welcome 
Center), visitor information assistance at key locations within the cemetery, and vehicle/pedestrian traffic control at designated locations .”  AR, Tab 22, RFP attach.  1, 
Performance Work Statement (PWS) at 1.   The solicitation provided the successful 
contractor would be required to “provide all personnel, supervision, equipment, 
materials, transportation, and non- personal services necess ary to perform” the tasks set 
out in the PWS.  Id. 
 The solicitation established that a “single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Order (TO) with cost reimbursable (CR no indirects/fee) line items for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) for a 12-month base period . . . and three 12- month option periods ” would be issued.  AR, 
Tab 23, Task Order Evaluation Plan (TOEP) at 2 .  Award would be made on a 
best-value tradeoff basis , considering a technical factor and cost/price, with the 
technical factor being significantly more important than cost/price.  Id.  The technical 
factor consisted of four evaluation areas, which the solicitation specifically emphasized 
were not subfactors and would not be separately weighted.  Id. at 5.  The four 
evaluation areas were:  (1) technical approach; (2) staffing approach; (3)  management 
process; and (4) transition plan.  Id.  at 5-8.   
 Under the technical factor , the agency would assess an offeror’s understanding of the 
requirements , the completeness and adequacy of the offeror’s response, and the 
feasibility of the offeror’s proposed approach .  AR, Tab 23, TOEP  at 11.  The evaluators 
would assign an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable for the technical factor , and also would assess technical risk.  Id.  at 11- 12.  
Price would be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.  Id.  at 14.  
 The agency received three proposals, including those submitted by the protester and 
awardee, Qi2.  AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision (SSD) at 1.   The Army 
established a competitive range that included all three offerors, and the agency conducted discussions with all three.  Id. at 3.  After reviewing offerors ’ discussion 
responses and revised proposals, “the Government identified the need to re- open 
discussions.”  Id.  The Army conducted a second round of discussions , after which final 
revised proposals  were submitted by all three offerors.  Id.   The agency assessed the 
protester’s and awardee’s final proposals as follows:

Technical Factor  Good  Outstanding  
Price   $32,144,684  $37,859,757  
 
Id. at 4.   
 The source selection authority ( SSA) conducted a tradeoff between BEI’s proposal, 
which was the lowest -priced of the three offers received, and Qi2’s higher technically 
rated proposal, which was the highest -priced of the three offers received.   AR, Tab 45, 
SSD at 8.  In conducting the tradeoff, the SSA acknowledged various meritorious 
aspects of BEI’s proposal, but also noted the proposal was assessed a significant weakness due to concerns that it did not include sufficient labor hours, resulting in a significant risk to performance.  Id. at 10-11.  The SSA found that while BEI “submitted 
the proposal with the lowest [price], the Offeror presents a less advantageous technical approach due to the inherent risks associated with the Significant Weakness.”  Id. at 11.   
In contrast, the SSA concluded Qi2’s “technical proposal is superior to all other offerors and provides the Government with the highest degree of confidence of successful task order performance.”  Id.  The SSA detailed a number of  advantages offered by Qi2’s  
proposal  that warranted payment of its  associated price premium , while still being below 
the independent government estimate (IGE) and “within the Government’s budget constraints.”  Id. at 11-12. 
 After being notified of the award decision and receiving a debriefing, BEI filed this 
protest with our Office.

DISCUSSION 
 As noted above, the evaluators assessed a significant weakness in the protester’s proposal because BEI did not propose sufficient labor hours to meet all the PWS requirements.  The protester challenges the agency’s conduct of discussions with 
regards to the significant weakness , as well as the underlying assessment of the 
weakness .  For the reasons explained below, we deny BEI’s challenges .  While we do 
not address every argument, or permutation thereof, raised by the protester, we have considered them all,  and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.

2 The value of the protested task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is 
within our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under defense agency IDIQ contracts.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B). 
3 For example, BEI contends the agency erred in not assessing one additional strength 
and two additional significant strengths in the firm’s proposal  related to the protester’s 
retention plan, transition plan, and personnel, respectivel y, the assessment of  which, 
the protester maintains, would have resulted in BEI’s proposal being assigned the 
highest adjectival rating of outstanding--rather than a rating of good--for the technical factor .  Protest at 33- 37.  In its comments on the agency’s report responding to the 
(continued...)   Page 4     B-423385   Significant Weakness  
 
Relevant to the significant weakness at the heart of BEI’s protest, are the solicitation’s staffing requirements and staffing approach evaluation criteria.   With respect to staffing, 
the solicitation require d the successful contractor to provide all necessary personnel to 
perform three categories of visitor operations services --visitor screening, visitor 
information assistance, and vehicle/pedestrian traffic control.  PWS at 40.   Personnel 
will be required to perform these services at both fixed posts and roving posts.  Id.  The 
solicitation set out  the post positions in PWS t echnical exhibit 4, which showed there 
were 43 posts to staff during the half of the year considered “summer months”  and 38 
posts to staff during the winter months.   Id. at 40, 71; Protest at 180 (Protest exh. A, 
RFP Questions and Answers at Q.  No. 2) .
4  In addition to specifying the posts to be 
 
protest, BEI withdrew  it contention that the evaluators should have assessed a strength 
for the protester’s proposed retention plan.  Comments at 33 n.19.   For the two 
remaining allegations of significant  strengths  the protester argues the agency 
improperly failed to assess , the crux of the protester’s contentions  is that BEI exceeded 
the RFP’s requirements  by having the incumbent contractor as part of its  team , by virtue 
of which BEI was able to offer a “ seamless transition” and personnel with experience 
working on the incumbent contract .  Protest at  36, 38- 39.   
An agency’s judgment that the features identified in a proposal do not exceed the requirements of a solicitation or provide advantages to the government warranting assessment of a strength is a matter within the agency’s discretion, which we will not disturb unless a protester shows the evaluation was unreasonable.  Assessment and 
Training Solutions Consulting Corp. , B-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 177 at 15.  Here, the protester has not made such a showing, and t he record provides 
no basis for us to question the evaluators’ judgment that neither BEI’s transition plan nor 
its personnel merited the assessment of additional significant strengths in the 
protester’s proposal.  For instance, the record shows the evaluators specifically noted 
BEI’s “proposal describes in detail their personnel with qualified experience,” but 
concluded BEI’s proposal in this respect met “the requirements in the staffing approach area.”  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 11.    
Although BEI may consider aspects of its proposal to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis 
on which to sustain the protest .  See e.g., CACI, Inc.--Federal , B-420729.2, Mar. 1, 
2023, 2023 CPD ¶  51 at 9 (denying allegation that proposal merited additional strengths 
where protest submission and contemporaneous evaluation record demonstrated only 
that protester “holds a different opinion from the evaluators” about the proposal).   Nor 
does the BEI team’s incumbency status entitle it to higher ratings or provide any basis 
for finding the evaluation unreasonable.  Pricewater houseCoopers Public Sector, LLP ,

continuously paginated Adobe PDF document.  For ease of reference, our citation here 
(continued...)   Page 5     B-423385   staffed, the solicitation provided technical exhibit 3, which included  detailed information 
about visitor trends and workload estimates to assist offerors with proposal preparation.  
Id. at 40, 63- 70;  see also AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 7.   
  
For all three types of services --screening, information assistance, and traffic control -- 
the solicitation require d the contractor to “maintain the appropriate number of personnel 
without vacancies to ensure” effective performance, and cautioned  that “no position 
shall remain vacant longer than five days without approval of the” agency.  PWS at 17.  Further, the solicitation indicated posts  that “shall not be self -breaking,” meaning 
“contractor personnel performing screening services in these positions shall remain at their designated area of responsibility at all times until relieved by another qualified contractor ” personnel.  Id. at 40- 41; see also at 44.    
 The solicitation established the normal operating hours for Arlington National Cemetery 
as 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day, and that funerals are conducted Monday  through 
Saturday .  PWS at 6-7.  The solicitation explained that the cemetery receives over 3 
million visitors a year, conducts approximately 7,000 funerals a year, and “over 3,400 other ceremonies such as commemorations, wreath ceremonies, and head- of-state 
visits” each year.  Id.  at 1.  The solicitation required  the provision of additional surge 
personnel , beyond the number needed to staff the regular posts , on an as needed basis 
for events  or holidays .  Id. at 42.    
 For evaluation of the staffing approach area, the solicitation required each proposal to provide “[a] detailed explanation of the Offeror’s staffing methodology ,” to include the 
“basis for calculating annual productive hours.”   AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 6 -7.  Specific to 
labor hours, the solicitation stated:  “If the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical hours/labor, the Offeror shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of t his variance.”   Id. 
at 7.  With respect to technical exhibit 3 , while it  was “not a Government required level 
of effort,” the solicitation stated that “any proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, 
and in sufficient enough detail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government’s requirement.”  Id.   
 The record reflects the agency’s evaluation was informed by the level of “historical support required” to perform the requirement .  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical 
Evaluation at 13.  Additionally, the record shows to aid in its comparison of offerors’ proposed staffing levels with historical staffing levels, the agency prepared an independent government estimate (IGE), which estimated a need for 10 0 full -time 
equivalents (FTEs) to perform the requirement .

The protester challenges the agency’s conduct of discussions related to the significant weakness assessed in BEI’s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  The protester 
contends the agency failed “to conduct meaningful discussions” about the significant weakness.  Protest at 17.  The protester maintains the Army failed “to provide sufficient information to allow BEI to understand the aspects of its staffing plan that the Agency found problematic so as to provide a reasonable opportunity to address those aspects and be competitive for award.”  Id.   The agency responds that “[d]iscussions were 
conducted appropriately and provided BEI with sufficient information allowing them to correct a significant weakness.”  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of 
Law ( COS/MOL ) at 13- 14.  We agree.  
 The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement at issue here.   M.A. 
Mortenson Co. , B-413714, Dec. 9, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶  361 at 8.  In this regard, section 
16.505 of the FAR does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order competition; nonetheless, when an agency conducts exchanges with offerors in a task order competition, those exchanges  must be fair , meaningful,  and not misleading.   
Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc. , B-419271.5 et al. , Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  191 
at 10-11.  In the context of both FAR part 15 and 16 procurements, our decisions have 
explained that for discussions to be meaningful  an agency need not “spoon- feed” an 
offeror as to each and every item that could be revised to improve an offeror’s proposal.  Abacus Tech.  Corp.; SMS Data Prods. Group, Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 2016, 
2016 CPD ¶  317 at 7 .  Rather, agencies  need only lead offerors into the areas of their 
proposals that require amplification or revision.   Id.; Engility Corp. , B-413120.3 et al. , 
Feb. 14, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  70 at 6.   Further, the exact content of discussions largely is 
a matter of the contracting officer’s judgment.  Id. at 8. 
 Relevant here, the record shows that during the second round of discussions, the agency issued BEI an evaluation notice (EN) that identified a significant weakness.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.  The EN stated:  “The Offeror proposes labor hours that are 
insufficient to provide the tasks listed in the PWS.”  Id.   The EN explained:  
 
The Offeror’s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take in account planed and unplanned vacancies/absences.  
 Insufficient staffing reflects a lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  
  Page 7     B-423385   Id.  The EN then advised:  “Failure to address this finding will likely impact the offeror’s 
proposal rating when re- evaluated.”  Id. 
 
In response, BEI represented:  “After a thorough review of our proposed staffing model, 
BEI has determined that we have provided adequate staffing to ensure each position/  
post is staffed 100 [percent]  of the time in accordance with the Performance Work 
Statement (PWS) requirements and that we did take into account planned and unplanned vacancies/absences.”  AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Resp onse at 2.  BEI then 
went on to explain how it developed its proposed labor hours.  See id. generally at 2- 4.  
The protest er concluded its response to the EN with the following assertion:  
 
BEI has proposed adequate hours for all proposed posts during full years (option periods).  Since BEI took a [DELETED]  approach to staffing that 
ensured each post was staffed at 100 [percent] , BEI has taken into 
account planned and unplanned vacancies/absences. . . .  Any additional 
hours would unnecessarily increase the cost to the government.  
 Id. at 4.  In short , BEI answered the EN by explaining the basis for its proposed labor 
hours, but chose not to increase its labor hours in response to the evaluators’ concern 
they were insufficient . 
 The evaluators found BEI’s response unconvincing, noting:  
 
In reviewing the Offeror’s proposal revision, the Offeror addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient 
Proposed Labor Hours).  Upon review of the Offeror’s final proposal submission, the previously identified significant weakness was not adequately resolved.  
 
AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9.  As a result, the agency assessed a significant weakness to BEI’s final proposal under the staffing approach area of the 
technical factor .  Id.  In addition to the significant weakness, BEI’s final proposal was 
assessed one significant strength and one strength, which resulted in the assignment of 
an overall rating of good for the technical evaluation factor .  Id. at 2, 9.  
 With respect to the significant weakness, the Army  found that BEI had continued to 
propose insufficient labor hours.  Specifically, the evaluators concluded:  
 
During the second round of discussions, the offeror provided an EN response for this finding that identified the Offeror did not take planned and unplanned vacancies/absences into account in their previous 
proposal submission.  The Offeror provided a detai led EN response that 
explained how they calculated their proposed hours.  However, there is 
significant risk to the Government based on the fact that the Government will not know if a post is manned (due to call outs/unplanned vacancies) under their staffi ng plan because the personnel are only responsible for  Page 8     B-423385   the hours they are on post.  The proposal does not address roll call or the 
inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post.  The Government would only find out about these issues when it is time to staff the post or upon notification from the employee that they are calling out and then have to scramble to get someone on site from the other s hift, 
or flex someone to cover their post from another post within ANC.  
 The Offeror’s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take into account the required pre and post shift tasks associated with contractor employee’s daily shifts.  
 Insufficient staffing reflects lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  
 Id. at 12- 13. 
 In support of its contention that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions, the protester first claims that “the Final Technical Evaluation Report concedes that BEI ‘addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient Proposed Labor Hours)’ but, nonetheless, identified a Significant Weakness in BEI’s 
Staffing Approach.”  Protest at 23.  Here, t he protester’s claim --that the evaluators 
considered BEI’s EN response sufficient to address the significant weakness --rings  
especially hollow given that the very next sentence in the final evaluation report  
unequivocally states,  “the previously identified significant weakness  was not adequately 
resolved. ”  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9 (emphasis added).   
 
The protester further compounds its selective reading of the agency’s evaluation by asserting next that the Army  “continues to couch its finally assigned Significant 
Weakness as a problem with BEI’s proposed labor hours, [but] the Agency’s actual 
concern appears to be” something else that was not conveyed to BEI during discussions.  Protest at 23.  Specifically, the protester contends “the Agency’s actual concern appears to be that BEI’s ‘proposal does not address roll call or t he inherent 
tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post,’ which could lead to late breaking changes in the specific personnel that may be available to perform on any given day and BEI ‘scrambl[ing]’ to adjust.”  Id. (citing AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical 
Evaluation at 12.  In this connection, t he protester contends :   
 
That concern is not tied to the number of labor hours BEI, or any other offeror, proposes to perform “the tasks listed in the PWS,” however, as personnel may call out of work on short notice and otherwise must get to work to perform “the tasks listed in the PWS” regardless of how many  Page 9     B-423385   labor hours an offeror proposed to provide.  Indeed, “the tasks listed in the 
PWS” do not include, for example, personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work such that it is patently unreasonable to expect any proposal to address “the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post” let alone to imagine that offerors would 
account for such time in pricing their proposals.  
 Protest at 23.  The protester characterizes the agency’s EN as “vague,” maintaining that it “did not provide sufficient information for BEI to understand that it needed to address ‘roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/t ransported to 
post’ to be competitive for award.”  Id.    
 As an initial matter, we note the protester’s interpretation of the evaluation’s reference to “inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post” as  equating 
to “personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work” is a fallacy premised on a false equivalency drawn from the language of the evaluation report.  When read in 
context with the preceding sentence’s stated concern that “personnel are only responsible for the hours they are on post,” it is clear the evaluators’ reference to there being insufficient hours to account for “inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post” relates to various pre- shift and post -shift tasks an employee will 
need to attend to at the cemetery outside of the normal  operating hours of 8:00 a.m. to 
5:00 p.m.  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 13; PWS at 6 (specifying the 
cemetery’s normal operating hours) ; see also id. at  41-48 (PWS sections 5.1.1.1, 
5.1.1.2, 5.1.3.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.10, 5.2.10.6, 5.2.12, 5.2.13, 5.2.14, 5.3.1.1, 5.4.1.2, 5.3.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.5.1, 5.5 specifying that various posts are required to be staffed during 
the entirety of the cemetery’s normal operating hours).   
 
The agency explains that “[t]he PWS includes descriptions of the pre and post operational hour tasks in multiple areas,” and that ensuring suffici ent labor hours to 
account for these tasks was “not reflected in BEI’s response to the EN” because “the proposed hours were based on an 8am start time.”  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 5 -6.  For example, section 5.7 of the PWS requires contractor personnel 
to perform daily checks of both government -furnished and contractor -furnished 
screening equi pment to ensure the equipment is fully operational , and the PWS task  
estimates some of these checks may take approximately 20 minutes .  PWS at 49 -50; 
see also AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 5 (proposing to “Perform/ensure 
[DELETED]. ”) and at 6 (similarly proposing to  perform [DELETED] related tasks ).  The 
agency acknowledges that BEI’s response to the EN showed “hours proposed for 
Visitor Screeners were based on 9 hours daily (8am - 5pm hours of operation IAW [in 
accordance with] PWS 5.1.1.1 and 5.1.1.2) ,” with additional hours  proposed “for 
‘[DELETED] ,’” but the evaluators found that BEI  still made “no mention of pre- shift 
preparation  or roll up of personnel to assume post positions by the 8am ANC opening 
time as a factor in BEI’s calculation of hours .”  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair 
Decl. at 6.  
  Page 10     B-423385   As another example, some of the post locations necessitate contractor personnel 
opening and closing access doors or other access points prior to the start of and after 
the end of a shift, respectively.  See e.g., PWS at 44-46 (§§ 5.2.10, 5.2.12).  A further 
example, is the PWS’ s description of “a significant amount of equipment, to include 
weather -conditional items which may need to be set -up, taken down, and stored daily 
such as umbrellas, tents, heaters, fuel, fans , folding chairs, and outdoor screening 
equipment ,” for which the pre -shift and post -shift set -up and take- down time “can be 
significant , especially considering the time it takes to transport personnel and 
equipment/supplies to the geographically dispersed post positions” throughout the cemetery.   AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 6 (citing PWS at  37-38).  
While not an exhaustive recitation of the PWS sections that set forth various “inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post,” these examples serve to highlight the disingenu ous nature of the protester’s contention that it could not have 
understood from the discussions EN that the agency wanted BEI ’s proposal  to include 
labor hours for “personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work.”  Protest at 23.    Turning to BEI’s contention that the EN was vague and failed to provide sufficient information about the specific areas for which the firm needed to provide additional labor hours, we find the protester’s contention unavailing.  The protester maintains that if “the Agency shared its actual areas of concern, BEI could and would have discussed ‘roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day/transported to post’ through additional explanation in its proposal and/or by increasing prop osed labor 
hours to alleviate the Agency’s concerns.”  Protest at 24.    
 
Contrary to the protester’s argument, the record reflect s the EN provided to BEI made 
clear that the evaluators did not believe the protester’s proposal included sufficient labor hours to perform all the PWS tasks.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at  1.  The record also 
shows the final evaluation report further elucidates the agency’s concerns  by including  
examples of why the evaluators did not consider BEI’s proposed hours sufficient  (e.g., 
coverage of incidental tasks) .  Compare AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1 with Tab AR, 
Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 12- 13.  While the agency could have 
discussed these more granular level examples with BEI, there was no requirement that the Army engage in such “spoon -feeding, ” and we will not substitute our view for 
matters within the contracting officer’s judgment.   See e.g., Engility Corp., supra at 9 
(denying discussions challenge where agency could have discussed additional areas of 
concern with protester’s proposal, but was not required to do so).  
 Our review of the record finds that t he agency ’s discussions properly led BEI to the area 
of concern with its proposal --i.e., insufficient labor hours to perform all PWS tasks.  
Further, the agency specifically cautioned, during discussions,  that “[f]ailure to address 
this finding will likely impact the offeror’s proposal rating when re -evaluated.”   AR, 
Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.   In response to the EN, BEI made a business judgment to not 
increase the number of labor hours proposed , but to instead explain why it disagreed 
with the evaluators’ assessment that the proposed hours were insufficient.  See generally AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.  Ultimately, it was t he protester’s  Page 11     B-423385   business judgment to leave unchanged BEI ’s proposed level of staffing that resulted in 
the negative evaluation, not discussions.  Accordingly, we deny BEI’s challenge to the 
agency’s conduct of discussions.  See e.g., Abacus  Tech. Corp.; SMS Data Prods. 
Group, Inc., supra at 9 (denying discussions challenge where agency led protester to general area of concern--staffing level for base period--and was under no obligation to 
provide any additional guidance or proposal direction).  
 
Assessment of Significant Weakness  
 In addition to protesting about the agency ’s conduct of discussions , the protester 
directly challenges , as unreasonable,  the assessment of the significant weakness in 
BEI’s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  T he protester contends the 
assessed weakness is “irrational” and “flawed .”  Protest at 24.  Specifically, the 
protester maintains  the evaluators unreasonably assessed the weakness because:   
(1) “historical staffing levels do not provide a valid comparison because the incumbent 
contract required more labor hours than the instant effort”; (2) “the Agency imposed unstated evaluation criteria i n concluding that additional labor hours are required for 
certain pre-  and post -duty tasks which are not identified in the PWS”; (3) “the Agency 
ignored critical information in BEI’s proposal that directly addresses the Agency’s concerns”; and (4) “BEI proposed significantly more hours than required based on the 
positions and tasks identified in the PWS .”
6  Id. at 24- 25.  The agency responds that 
BEI’s protest “merely argues with the evaluation results,” and that such “mere disagreement with the agency’s evaluation does not demonstrate that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable.”  COS/MOL at 25.  We agree.  
 
As stated above, the task order competition here was conducted pursuant to FAR 
subpart 16.5. The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a 
matter within the contracting agency ’s discretion, because the agency is responsible for 
defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them. Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc. , supra at 7.  In reviewing protests of an award in a task order competition, 
we do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation ’s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.   
CACI , Inc.-- Federal, supra at 7.  A protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment 
of the relative merit of competing proposals, without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Id. ; Engility Corp., supra at 4-5.  
   Use of Historical Staffing Levels in Evaluation of Proposals  
 Relevant here, t he IGE estimated a need for 10 0 FTEs to staff the contract.  AR, 
Tab 50, IGE at  1.  The record shows BEI’s proposal offered [DELETED]  FTEs , and was 
assessed a significant weakness  for proposing insufficient labor hours .  AR, Tab 32, BEI 
 
6 The protester raises additional ancillary arguments  challenging the assessed 
significant weakness as unreasonable.  While not addressed in our discussion, we have 
considered each of these ancillary arguments and find them all to be without merit.   Page 12     B-423385   Final Technical Proposal at 13; Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9, 12- 13.  In 
challenging the reasonableness of this  significant weakness , the protester  takes aim at 
the IGE, arguing it is “vastly overinflated, likely because it appears the Agency based its 
estimates on the expanded but now outdated requirements from the incumbent 
contract.”  Comments at 13.    
 The protester argues  the agency’s use of historical staffing levels as part of the 
evaluation was unreasonable because those “levels do not provide a valid comparison” to “the instant effort .”  Protest at 24- 25.  The protester points out that the incumbent 
contractor is part of BEI’s team, and the firm represents that this provides “Team BEI” with “firsthand knowledge” and “an intimate understanding of the staffing levels and skill 
sets required.”  Id. at 26 -27.  Similarly, the protester claims , “the BEI te am has unique 
insight  into the labor hours required for successful performance,” and that it “reasonably 
drew” on this “firsthand knowledge of staffing levels as the incumbent to develop its efficient and realistic proposed level of effort.”  Id.  at 27.   Further, the protester 
maintains “the solicitation for the incumbent contract required lengthier hours at each post and a different labor mix as the basis for estimate for the required hours, so the total number of hours on the incumbent contract is mark edly greater than required to 
perform the scope of work under the current Solicitation.”  Id.   
   
Our Bid Protest Re gulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a 
solicitation that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1).   Our timeliness rules reflect the dual 
requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.   
Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 260 at 4.  To this 
end, a protester may not wait until after award has been made to protest alleged flaws in the procurement’s ground rules that are apparent prior to submission of proposals.  Microsoft Corp., B -420004, B -420004.2, Oct. 29, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 155 at 30.  
 Here, as discussed above, the solicitation included as t echnical exhibit 3  visitor trends , 
workload estimates , and stated that while this exhibit did not establish a required level 
of effort  “any proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, and in sufficient enough 
detail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government’s requirements.”  AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 7.   More directly, the solicitation’s evaluation methodology  provided:  
“If the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical  hours/labor, the 
Offeror shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of this variance.”  Id.   Thus, the solicitation squarely placed 
offerors  on notice that the agency intended to use “historical hours/labor” as a 
benchmark for assessing proposals.    
 If, as expressed in its protest, BEI did not believe that historical staffing levels represented an accurate comparison point for the solicited requirement , the firm was 
required to raise that concern prior to the time set for receipt of proposals.   Having 
waited to protest this issue until after the time set for receipt of proposals and after 
award, BEI’s argument arising from this alleged solicitation impropriety is dismissed as  Page 13     B-423385   untimely .7  See e.g., Microsoft Corp., supra at 30; Facility Healthcare Servs., Inc. , 
B-418743.2, B -418743.3, Sept. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 313 at 7 n.4 (dismissing as 
untimely post -award argument that comparing proposed prices to IGE was not an 
adequate evaluation method where solicitation informed offerors such an evaluation 
could take place).  
   Unstated Evaluation Criteria 
 In addition to challenging the accuracy of the IGE used by the agency as a comparative evaluative benchmark, the protester contends the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by downgrading BEI’s proposal for not addressing “required pre and post shift 
tasks”  that are “not actually specified in the Solicitation.”   Protest at 27 -28.  Contrary to 
the protester’s contention, however, and as detailed above, the PWS  included a variety 
of pre- shift and post -shift tasks--e.g., daily equipment checks, opening and closing 
access to certain parts of the cemetery, etc.   Accordingly, we find no merit in BEI’s claim 
that the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by expecting offerors to propose sufficient staff to perform all the tasks set forth in the PWS.  See e.g., CAE USA, Inc. , 
B-421550 et al. , June 22, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 149 at 7 (denying protest allegation that  
assessment of protester’s staffing used unstated evaluation criteria where the language of the solicitation belied protester’s argument).  
   Proposal Information and Sufficiency of Proposed Labor Hours  
 The protester further argues that BEI’s proposal did, in fact, address the agency’s 
concerns related to pre- shift and post -shift tasks by offering “more hours than required 
by the normal duty hours” to be “more than sufficient to cover” these various activ ities.  
Protest at 30.  Speci fically, the protester claims , “BEI proposed significantly more hours 
than required,” and characterizes the assessed weakness as “unjustified and, frankly, baffling.”  Id.  at 24-25.  In support of this contention, the protester  explains how it 
calculated the number of labor hours needed, and insists  its methodology resulted in 
BEI proposing hours that were “roughly  [DELETED] higher than the Government’s 
stated requirement.”  Id. at 26.  The explanation provided in BEI’s protest, however, is 
simply a summation of the explanation included in BEI’s proposal and responses to 
discussion ENs .  Compare id. with AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13- 14; 
see also generally  Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.   
 In this  connection, BEI ’s explanation describes how the firm  calculated the number of 
hours required for each post to be continuously staffed  during the cemetery’s operating 
hours  of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m .  For example, for the visitor screener posts, BEI made 
 
7 Although we need not address the merits of this argument, we note the agency 
presented a detailed rebuttal of the protester’s claim that the IGE is inaccurate.  The Army explained that while the incumbent task order, as initially awarded, did require longer hours at various posts, the order was later modified to reduce the “hours of operation to those reflected in the current PWS.”  Supp. COS/MOL at 2; see also generally AR, Tab 56, Supp. Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 1- 2.  Page 14     B-423385   one calculation for the 183 days of the summer months when there are 18 screener 
posts to staff and a second calculation for the 182 days of the winter months when there 
are 14  posts to staff.  AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13.  BEI  added 
[DELETED] FTE [DELETED],  resulting in [DELETED] positions  to staff in the summer 
and [DELETED]  in the winter.  Id.  For each season’s calculations, BEI multiplied 
9 hours per day by 183 or 182 days , multiplied that by the number of posts for the 
summer and winter months, then added the two figures to reach a total number of [DELETED]  hours --or [DELETED] FTEs --needed to staff each of the visitor screener 
posts for exactly 9 hours per day.
8  Id. at 13-14.  BEI ’s proposal also included additional 
hours for [DELETED] , but those hours were specified for those purposes and were not 
represented as being available for the performance of pre- shift or post -shift tasks or 
covering for employee breaks.  Id. at 14.  
 As noted in our assessment of the protester’s discussions challenge, the record shows 
the evaluators considered the basis for BEI’s labor hour estimate that was included in 
the firm’s proposal and discussions response, and, notwithstanding these explanations , 
found the proposed hours insufficient.  Based on the record before us, we find 
imminently reasonable the evaluators’ judgment  that BEI’s approach of providing 
enough FTEs to staff posts for exactly 9 hours per day , without provision for pre-shift 
and post -shift duties outlined in the PWS, and with minimal staffing to cover breaks  
failed to provide the amount of support needed to perform the contract , warranting 
assessment of a significant weakness.  While BEI has expressed its disagreement with the evaluators’ judgment in myriad arguments throughout its protest, BEI has not shown 
that the evaluation was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.
9  Accordingly, 
 
8 Summer ( 9 hours per day * 183  days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) + 
Winter (9 hours per day * 182 days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) = Total 
Annual Hours of [DELETED]  divided by [DELETED]  annual hours per FTE = 
[DELETED]  FTEs .  AR, tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at  13-14. 
9 Among the protester’s myriad arguments, is BEI’s assertion that the assessed 
significant weakness is unreasonable because it “resulted from a cursory, mechanical 
comparison of bottom -line numbers between BEI’s proposed labor hours and the IGE.”  
Comments at 23.  The protester claims “the Agency’s cursory review showed that BEI’s bottom -line numbers were below the IGE, and so, the Agency contrived generic reasons 
as to why that is problematic.”  Id.  at 24.  The record does not support such a finding.  
Rather, as detailed above, the record shows the evaluators fully considered the information in BEI’s proposal and discussions response, and detailed in the contemporaneous evaluation record why that inf ormation was not sufficient to alleviate 
concerns about the insufficiency of BEI’s proposed labor hours.   
To the extent, the protester’s c ontention that the evaluators “contrived generic reasons” 
for assessing a significant weakness in BEI’s proposal can be construed as an allegation of bad faith, we find such an allegation meritless.  As a general matter, government officials are presumed to act in good faith, and a protester’s contention that procurement officials were motivated by bias or bad faith must be supported by 
(continued...)   Page 15     B-423385   we deny the protester’s various challenges to the assessment of a significant weakness 
in BEI’s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.   See e.g.,  Abacus Tech. Corp.; 
SMS Data Products Group, Inc., supra at  5-6 (denying challenge to assessment of 
deficiency for protester’s staffing plan where protester disagreed with assessment, but 
did not show it was unreasonable or contrary to solicitation);  NCI Info. Sys., Inc.,

a significant weakness  for protester’s staffing approach where protester’s various 
arguments  expressed nothing more than protester’s disagreement with the agency’s 
evaluation judgments).  
 
Best-Value Tradeoff  
 Finally, t he protester argues that the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision was 
improper because it was based on a flawed technical evaluation.
10  Protest at 39 -40.  
This allegation is derivative of the protester’s challenges to the agency’s evaluation of 
BEI’s proposal.  As discussed above, we find no basis to object to the agency’s 
evaluation of the protester’s proposal.  Accordingly, we dismiss this allegation because  derivative allegations do not establish an independent bases of protest.

Here, the protester has failed to provide any proof, let alone convincing proof, that the evaluators “contrived generic reasons” for downgrading BEI’s proposal.   
10 Initially, the protester also argued:   
There is no indication that the Agency properly considered the lower price 
and numerous unique strengths associated with BEI’s proposal as compared to the awardee’s proposal in making the award decision, 
however .  Nor does the record provide a rational explanation as to the 
purported benefits of the awardee’s proposal which are unmatched by BEI so as to warrant paying the awardee’s substantial price premium.  
Protest at 40 (internal citations omitted) .  The agency report specifically and 
substantively addressed this issue.  COS/MOL at 32, 34- 37.  In its comments on the 
agency report, BEI did not reply to the agency’s response or further pursue this protest issue.  See  Comments at 41.  We therefore consider this argument to be abandoned 
and we will not consider it further.   4 C.F.R. § 21.3(i)(3); Calhoun Int’l, LLC , B-421047,

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423425    
BACKGROUND  
 The RFP , which was issued on December 10, 2024,  and subsequently amended four 
times, sought proposals for the award of multiple IDIQ contracts  to fulfill a recurring 
need for minor construction and maintenance projects at Prince Sultan Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  AR, Tab 5, RFP at 1, 5.  The RFP contemplated the award of 
contracts with 5 -year ordering periods and an aggregate maximum value of 
$100,000,000 across all contracts.
2  Id. 
 
Awards  of the IDIQ contracts  were to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis  
considering two non- price factors:  technical and past performance.3  AR, Tab 10, RFP, 
amend. 4, Section M at 1.  The RFP contemplated a two- step evaluation process.  First, 
the technical  factor , which was to be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, 
included three subfactors:  (i) design package; (ii)  progress schedule;  and 
(iii) material/labor breakdown.  Id. at 2.  Only those proposals evaluated as being 
technically acceptable would advance to the past performance evaluation phase.  Id. 
at 1. 
 
In phase two, offerors’ past performance would be evaluated for recency, relevancy, 
and quality,  and assessed one of the following overall confidence assessments:  
substantial ; satisfactory ; neutral ; limited ; or n o confidence.  Id. at 3, 5.  Relevant here, a 
substantial confidence rating would be warranted where “[b]ased on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,” and a neutral confidence rating 
would be warranted where “[n]o recent/relevant performance r ecord is available or the 
offeror’s performance record [and] is so sparse that no meaningful confidence 
assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.”  Id.  The RFP further provided that a 
proposal assigned a neutral confidence rating “may not be evaluated favorably or 
unfavorably on the factor of past performance.”  Id. 
 Relevant to the issues presented in the protest, the RFP’s section L proposal 
instructions provided that “the offeror shall submit Past Performance information for 
itself as a prime contractor only,” and that “experience performing as a subcontractor 
will not be considered.”  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L at 6 .  The RFP’s section 
M evaluation criteria also explained  that the agency would evaluate the past 
performance of predecessor companies, affiliates, other divisions, or corporate 
management where the offeror demonstrated  that such third party would be 
meaningfully involved in the resulting contract.  Specifically, the provision stated:  
 
2 The agency’s internal acquisition plan anticipated five to seven IDIQ contract awards.  
AR, Tab 4, Acquisition Plan at 5.  
3 Price was not to be evaluated for the award of the IDIQ contracts but was to be 
evaluated for the award of the “seed project ” task order.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, 
Section M at 5.   Page 3    B-423425   The Government  will take into account past performance information 
regarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or 
corporate management if such was provided for evaluation and if the offeror’s past performance volume (Volume III) demonstrates the company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for the instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other capabilities demonstrating direct and meaningful involvement in the performance of the proposed instant effort.  Offerors shall clearly indicate 
the connection or linkage with the predecessor companies.  
 
AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 3.  
   
Also relevant, s ection L IIID(5) (a) of the RFP’s instructions required offerors  to exert 
their best effort to ensure that two points of contact (POC) for  each past performance 
reference submit ted a completed past performance questionnaire (PPQ)  to the agency  
by no later than 5 p.m. on January 22, 2025.  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L, 
at 7.  This provision specifically  established that “[t]he responsibility to send out and 
track the completion of the Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity).”  Id. 
 The RFP provided that the agency intended to award contracts to all responsible 
offerors that were evaluated as technically acceptable with a substantial confidence past performance assessment.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 1 .  The RFP 
further provided that the agency would make a comparative analysis of technically acceptable proposals by ranking proposals from highest to lowest in the order of their 
past performance confidence rating, and then integrate the source selection team’s 
evaluations.  Id. 
 
Prior to  the receipt of proposals, JLC and the contracting officer exchanged emails 
discussing the various requirements described in sections L and M  pertaining to past 
performance.  In one exchange, the contracting officer  reiterated to JLC that the agency 
would not consider information about an offeror’s  past performance as a subcontractor .  
Req. for Dismissal, attach. 9, Email from Contracting Officer to JLC  at 1.  The 
contracting officer  then directed JLC to review section M IID(1)(b)’s provision regarding 
the acceptability of past performance of affiliates.  Id.   
 In a separate email exchange related to the submission of PPQs , the contracting officer  
stated that he would contact the protester ’s POCs for its past performance if the agency 
did not receive submitted PPQs for the references by the January 22, 2025,  deadline.  
Specifically, the contracting officer informed JLC that : 
 
[W]e will reach -out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in 
the blanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as 
many qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.   Page 4    B-423425

The agency received 18 proposals in response to the RFP, including from JLC.  See 
AR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror at 1.  Relevant here, JLC submitted three past performance references  for consideration.  Two of the references were performed 
by a corporate affiliate as a prime contractor, and one project was performed by a joint venture comprised by JLC and its corporate affiliate.  AR, Tab 13, JLC Past Performance Proposal at 2.  The proposal further explained that the corporate affiliate would be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract by providing design management, finance, procurement and logistics of long lead items, and supporting quality control management.  Id.  
 The agency ultimately declined to consider any of JLC’s three references.  It did not 
consider the reference performed by the joint venture because the agency found that the contract  was performed outside of the RFP’s recency period.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of 
Unsuccessful Offeror  at 2.  The agency rejected the other two references because t he 
contracts were performed by an entity other than JLC, and JLC “failed to sufficiently 
explain how [it] contributed to the prime contractor’s performance above and beyond 
subcontracting effort.”  Id. 
 Furthermore, the agency concluded that it did not have sufficient quality assessment information about JLC’s performance of the contracts  because the agency did not 
receive completed PPQs for any of JLC’s  references by the RFP’s prescribed due date.   
Furthermore, the agency represents that it did not reach out to the POCs for the two 
references performed by JLC ’s affiliate  because they were not performed by the 
protester.  See Agency Resp.  to Req. for Supp. Briefing, attach. 1, Decl. of the 
Contracting Offi cer at 1- 2.  As a result, the agency assigned the protester’s past 
performance a rating of neutral confidence.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror 
at 2. 
 Consistent with the agency’s evaluation criteria and basis of award, the agency subsequently selected for award the six proposals that were evaluated as technically acceptable and had a rating of substantial confidence for past performance.  The source 
selection official further  determined that this number of awardees would “bring the best 
competition outcomes for future task orders” and “the awarded vendor pool is still a desirable outcome to meet future task order requirements.”  AR, Tab 16, Source Select ion Decision at 3.  After the agency provided JLC with a debriefing, this protest 
followed.  
  Page 5    B-423425   DISCUSSION 
 JLC presents  two principal  protest issues, both related to how the agency evaluated the 
protester’s  past performance.
4  First, JLC contends that the agency erred when it failed 
to consider the past performance of its corporate affiliate that would have meaningful 
involvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  See, e.g. , Protest at 1.  In 
particular, the protester  argues that the agency improperly categorized the past 
performance of its affiliate  as instances of JLC’s subcontracting experience, which the 
agency would not consider under section L IIID(1)(a)  of the RFP , rather than as past 
performance of an affiliate company, which the agency was to  consider under section 
M IID(1)(b).  Id. at 2. 
 
The agency responds that JLC misinterpreted the meaning of these two solicitation provisions .  Memorandum of Law (MOL)  at 8.  The agency argues while the RFP 
allowed an offeror to provide affiliate past performance, the offeror had to establish “how 
it contributed to [the affiliate’s]  prime contractor performance above and beyond a 
subcontracting effort.”  Id. at 6.  The agency alternatively argues that the sections are in 
“obvious conflict ,” and create a patent ambiguity  that is untimely raised after award.  Id. 
at 8.  In this regard, the agency argues that s ection L IIID(1)(a) excludes all past 
performance from agency consideration except for the offeror’s  own past performance 
as a prime contractor.  Id.  The agency further contends that to the extent section M 
IID(1)(b) provide d that the agency would consider the past performance of entities 
besides the offeror  as a prime contractor, such a reading is in clear contradiction with  
 
4 The protester raises a number of collateral arguments.  While our decision does not 
specifically address each argument, we have reviewed all  of the arguments and find 
that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, JLC argues that it was improperly excluded from award based solely on its neutral past performance confidence rating in a manner contrary to the RFP’s requirement that a neutral confidence rating would not be unfavorably evaluated by the agenc y.  See, e.g. , 
Comments at 13.  We disagree.   
Here, the RFP unambiguously provided that the agency intended to make award to all proposals evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4 at 1.  The record reflects that consistent with the RFP’s unambiguous terms, the source selection official reasonably made award to the six technically acceptable proposals with substantial past performance confidence ratings.  Further, the source selection official ultimately determined that six awards were sufficient to satisfy the government’s requirements and to provide adequate competition at the task order level.  AR, Tab 16, Source Selection Decision at 3.  On this record, we 
disagree with the protester’s argument that the agency was required to consider proposals beyond those that were evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  See Deloitte Consulting, LLP; Softrams, LLC , 
B-421801.2 et al. , Jan. 30, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 41 at 4 n.2 (denying protest ground that 
the agency should have made additional awards where the record reasonably supported the agency’s decision as to the number of contracts awarded).   Page 6    B-423425   the section L provision.  Id.  In either case, the agency contends that it reasonably did 
not consider the corporate affiliate’s past performance references.  
 
Second, JLC argues that  to the extent we agree with its interpretation of the 
solicitation’s provisions discussed above and the agency should have considered its affiliate’s past performance references , the agency  unreasonably  failed to contact the 
POCs provided in JLC’s proposal, despite the contracting officer  representing that he 
would do so in a pre- award email exchange with JLC.  Protest at  2-3.  JLC  ultimately  
concludes that, had the agency included its affiliate’s  past performance and contacted 
the listed POCs when evaluating JLC’s past performance, then JLC would have 
received a past performance rating of substantial confidence and been selected for a 
contract award.  Id. at 3. 
 For the reasons that follow, we agree with the protester ’s interpretation of  the 
solicitation --it did not limit the agency to considering past performance information about 
contracts performed by JLC  itself such that the agency could disregard the information 
about JLC’s affiliate and we reject the agency’s contention that the solicitation was 
patently ambiguous on this point .  Nevertheless , because the protester failed to ensure 
that the agency timely received PPQs for the references --as it was required to do by the 
unambiguous terms of the RFP --the agency reasonably determined that the absence of 
quality information would support JLC’s rating of  neutral confidence and, therefore, the 
protester cannot establish any competitive prejudice.  
 Regarding the question of whether the solicitation precluded the agency from 
consider ing the past performance references of JLC’s affiliate, w here a dispute exists as 
to a solicitation’s actual requirements, we begin by examining the plain language of solicitation.  Harper Constr. Co., Inc. , B-415042, B -415042.2, Nov. 7, 2017, 2018 CPD 
¶ 47 at 4.  We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation by reading the solicitation 
as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a reading.  Desbuild Inc. , 
B-413613.2, Jan.  13, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  23 at 5.  An interpretation is unreasonable if it 
fails to give meaning to all of a solicitation’s provisions, renders any part of the solicitation absurd, surplus, or creates conflicts.  Innovative Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , 
B-419834.2, B -419834.3, Sept . 20, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 319 at 15.   
 If the solicitation language is unambiguous, our inquiry ceases.  Id.  An ambiguity, 
however, exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the solicitation are possible.  Colt Def., LLC , B-406696, July 24, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 302 at 8.  If the 
ambiguity is an obvious, gross, or glaring error in the solicitation then it is a patent ambiguity.   Id.  A patent ambiguity must be protested prior to the closing time for receipt 
of proposals to be considered timely.   Office Design Grp., B -415411, Jan. 3, 2018, 
2018 CPD ¶ 43 at 4.   Here, we conclude that the disputed provisions of the solicitation 
are unambiguous, and the agency’s interpretation is  not reasonable.  
 As stated above,  the RFP’s instructions  provided that “ [t]he offeror shall submit Past 
Performance information for itself as a prime contractor only,” and that “experience  Page 7    B-423425   performing as a subcontractor will not be considered.”  AR, Tab 8,  RFP, amend. 3, 
Section L at 6.  The location of the word “only” in the provision is significant in 
interpreting its plain meaning.   Here, the “only” relates to the requirement that the cited 
past performance must be as a prime contractor.  JLC additionally argues that this 
interpretation is further supported by the next sentence of the instruction, which emphasizes that the agency will not consider subcontractor experience.  In sum, we find the interpretation advanced by the protester is reasonable and comports with the plain meaning of the instruction as written.  
 In contrast, the agency advances an unreasonable interpretation which effectively seeks to move the “only” to relate to the offeror itself.  In this regard, the agency’s interpretation that the instruction limits past performance references only to the offer or 
itself effectively would read the instruction as if it were written as the offeror shall submit past performance information only for itself  as a prime contractor.  We do not believe 
that the agency’s interpretation is consistent with the plain text or import of the instruction.  
 We next consider the evaluation criteria’s provision that the agency would consider the past performance of related entities.  In this regard, the RFP unambiguously states that “[t]he [agency] will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or corporate management if such was provided for evaluation.” AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend.  4, Section M at 3.   The 
provision further provides that in order to rely on such references, the protester must demonstrate “the company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for 
the instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other 
capabilities.”  Id.  The protester contends that the instruction and evaluation criteri on 
can be read in a manner that harmonizes and gives effect to both provisions.  Specifically, JLC contends that the instructions require that each past performance reference have been performed as a prime contractor, and the evaluation criteri on 
makes clear that such references could have been performed either by the offeror or a 
related entity that will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  We agree with the protester that this interpretation is reasonable and prov ides 
effect to both provisions.  
 In contrast, w e disagree with the agency’s alternative interpretation of the two 
provisions, which it  argues imposes a requirement on offerors who include past 
performance of related entities  to have performed itself on those previous contracts 
“above and beyond a subcontracting effort.”  MOL at 6.   In this regard, nothing in the 
evaluation criteria require the offeror to demonstrate its performance on the related entity’s past performance references.   Rather,  the relevant evaluation criteri on required 
that the offeror demonstrate the related entity’s anticipated meaningful involvement on 
the resulting contract.  Nothing in the RFP instructed  offerors  to describe their own 
performance on the past performance references submitted on behalf of related entities , 
let alone establish that such performance was “above and beyond a subcontracting effort.”  Instead, the plain meaning of this provision instructs the opposite:  that offerors 
must describe how the related entity  will perform on the present proposed effor t.  Page 8    B-423425    
In sum, we find that the solicitation’s past performance requirements were not ambiguous and only the protester’s proffered  interpretation is reasonable.  Therefore, 
we agree that the agency erred in failing to consider the past performance references submitted on behalf of JLC’s affiliate that was proposed to be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract.  
 This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry.  Specifically, in addition to finding the rejecting the references because they were submitted on behalf of an affiliate, the 
agency also noted that it never received timely PPQs for the references, and, thus, the lack of quality assessment information would nevertheless support JLC’s neutral confidence past performance assessment.
5  To the extent the agency did not receive 
PPQs, nothing in the solicitation required the agency to affirmatively contact the POCs for the protester’s past performance references.   
 In this regard, Our Office has generally declined to find that an agency has an affirmative obligation to seek out past performance information where the solicitation places the burden on offerors to ensure the timely submission of PPQs.  See, e.g. , 
MicroTechnologies , LLC , B-420196.3, B -420196.4, Jan. 6, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 17 at  9.  
Here, the RFP unambiguously charged offerors with ensuring that the agency timely received completed PPQs from at least POCs per reference.  Specifically, the RFP stated that each offeror was to “exert your best effort  to ensure that at least two (2) 
POCs  per relevant contract submitted a completed [PPQ] directly to the Government 
[no later than] 5:00 p.m. on 22 January 2025 for receipt of proposals,” and that  “[t]he responsibility to send out and track the completion of the [PPQs]  rests solely with 
the offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity) .”  AR, Tab 8, RFP, 
amend.  3, Section L at 7.  
 Notwithstanding the plain terms of the solicitation, the protester nevertheless argues that the contracting officer made representations that he would contact past performance reference POCs in the event PPQs were not timely received.  Specifically, the pr otester points to a pre- award email where the contracting officer represented that 
the agency would:  
 
[R]each- out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in the 
blanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as 
many qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.  
 
 
5 We note that the agency was not obligated to consider a  PPQ that was received 
almost a month after the submission deadline where the RFP clearly established that it was the protester’s responsibility to ensure that the completed PPQs were received by a prescribed deadline.  See ZemiTek, LLC ; Integrated Fed. Solutions, Inc. , B-415313, 
B-415313.2, Dec.  20, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 181 at 10- 11.  Page 9    B-423425   Comments at 12.  
 
For the reasons that follow, we find that the contracting officer’s email, which was not incorporated into the solicitation as an amendment, created a patent ambiguity that needed to be protested prior to the due date for the submission of proposals . 
 Under our Bid Protest Regulations, alleged improprieties in a solicitation apparent prior 
to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals must be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(1).  A written communication 
from a contracting officer that does not amend the solicitation but is directly contrary to the terms of the solicitation creates a patent ambiguity that must be protested in accordance with the timeliness requirements of 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a) (1).  See, e.g. , 
Harrington, Moran, Barksdale, Inc. , B-401934.2, B -401934.3, Sep. 10, 2010, 2010 CPD 
¶ 231 at 5 (dismissing as untimely a post -award argument that an email from the 
contracting officer created an ambiguity as to the solicitation’s experience requirements); Input Solutions, Inc. , B-294123, Aug. 31, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶  185 at 3- 4 
(same, where the protester alleged that the agency’s written discussions letter superseded the solicitation’s proposal preparation instructions).  
 To the extent the protester contends that the contracting officer’s email exchange relieved the protester of its non- delegable obligation to ensure the timely submission of 
completed PPQs to the agency, such an interpretation would present a patent ambigui ty 
that needed to be protested prior to the closing date for proposals .  On this record, we 
find no basis to conclude that the agency was obligated to contact the protester’s PPQ references, and, therefore, find no basis to sustain the protest where the neutral past 
performance assessment would still be justified based on the lack of any quality related information available for the past performance references of JLC’s affiliate.  
 In conclusion, although we find that the agency improperly evaluated JLC’s past performance when it rejected the past performance of JLC’s  affiliate, we do not find that 
the agency’s error resulted in competitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an 
essential element of every protest, and requires that a protester prove that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have received the award.  Alexandra Constr., Inc. , B-417212, 
Apr. 2, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 132 at 6.  Under the facts here, the protester  did not  suffer  
any competitive prejudice because, even if the agency had properly considered the past 
performance of JLC’s affiliate, the agency still would have lacked the PPQs necessary to assess the quality of JLC’s past performance.  As a result, we do not find that JLC 
would have received a substantial past performance rating in the absence of the 
agency’s error  and, therefore, would not have been in line for award . 
 The protest is denied.

Protest challenging the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s past performance as only 
warranting a rating of “ neutral confidence”  and the resulting decision not to award the 
protester a contract  is denied.  Although the agency unreasonably interpreted the 
solicitation to prohibit the evaluation of past performance references submitted for  the 
protester’s corporate affiliate, the neutral confidence rating was nevertheless 
reasonable where the protester failed to ensure that past performance questionnaires for its affiliate’s references were timely submitted to the agency.

Agency Report (AR), Tab 19, Unsuccessful Offeror Notice at 1.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2    B-423425    
BACKGROUND  
 The RFP , which was issued on December 10, 2024,  and subsequently amended four 
times, sought proposals for the award of multiple IDIQ contracts  to fulfill a recurring 
need for minor construction and maintenance projects at Prince Sultan Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  AR, Tab 5, RFP at 1, 5.  The RFP contemplated the award of 
contracts with 5 -year ordering periods and an aggregate maximum value of 
$100,000,000 across all contracts.
2  Id. 
 
Awards  of the IDIQ contracts  were to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis  
considering two non- price factors:  technical and past performance.3  AR, Tab 10, RFP, 
amend. 4, Section M at 1.  The RFP contemplated a two- step evaluation process.  First, 
the technical  factor , which was to be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, 
included three subfactors:  (i) design package; (ii)  progress schedule;  and 
(iii) material/labor breakdown.  Id. at 2.  Only those proposals evaluated as being 
technically acceptable would advance to the past performance evaluation phase.  Id. 
at 1. 
 
In phase two, offerors’ past performance would be evaluated for recency, relevancy, 
and quality,  and assessed one of the following overall confidence assessments:  
substantial ; satisfactory ; neutral ; limited ; or n o confidence.  Id. at 3, 5.  Relevant here, a 
substantial confidence rating would be warranted where “[b]ased on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,” and a neutral confidence rating 
would be warranted where “[n]o recent/relevant performance r ecord is available or the 
offeror’s performance record [and] is so sparse that no meaningful confidence 
assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.”  Id.  The RFP further provided that a 
proposal assigned a neutral confidence rating “may not be evaluated favorably or 
unfavorably on the factor of past performance.”  Id. 
 Relevant to the issues presented in the protest, the RFP’s section L proposal 
instructions provided that “the offeror shall submit Past Performance information for 
itself as a prime contractor only,” and that “experience performing as a subcontractor 
will not be considered.”  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L at 6 .  The RFP’s section 
M evaluation criteria also explained  that the agency would evaluate the past 
performance of predecessor companies, affiliates, other divisions, or corporate 
management where the offeror demonstrated  that such third party would be 
meaningfully involved in the resulting contract.  Specifically, the provision stated:  
 
2 The agency’s internal acquisition plan anticipated five to seven IDIQ contract awards.  
AR, Tab 4, Acquisition Plan at 5.  
3 Price was not to be evaluated for the award of the IDIQ contracts but was to be 
evaluated for the award of the “seed project ” task order.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, 
Section M at 5.   Page 3    B-423425   The Government  will take into account past performance information 
regarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or 
corporate management if such was provided for evaluation and if the offeror’s past performance volume (Volume III) demonstrates the company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for the instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other capabilities demonstrating direct and meaningful involvement in the performance of the proposed instant effort.  Offerors shall clearly indicate 
the connection or linkage with the predecessor companies.  
 
AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 3.  
   
Also relevant, s ection L IIID(5) (a) of the RFP’s instructions required offerors  to exert 
their best effort to ensure that two points of contact (POC) for  each past performance 
reference submit ted a completed past performance questionnaire (PPQ)  to the agency  
by no later than 5 p.m. on January 22, 2025.  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L, 
at 7.  This provision specifically  established that “[t]he responsibility to send out and 
track the completion of the Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity).”  Id. 
 The RFP provided that the agency intended to award contracts to all responsible 
offerors that were evaluated as technically acceptable with a substantial confidence past performance assessment.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 1 .  The RFP 
further provided that the agency would make a comparative analysis of technically acceptable proposals by ranking proposals from highest to lowest in the order of their 
past performance confidence rating, and then integrate the source selection team’s 
evaluations.  Id. 
 
Prior to  the receipt of proposals, JLC and the contracting officer exchanged emails 
discussing the various requirements described in sections L and M  pertaining to past 
performance.  In one exchange, the contracting officer  reiterated to JLC that the agency 
would not consider information about an offeror’s  past performance as a subcontractor .  
Req. for Dismissal, attach. 9, Email from Contracting Officer to JLC  at 1.  The 
contracting officer  then directed JLC to review section M IID(1)(b)’s provision regarding 
the acceptability of past performance of affiliates.  Id.   
 In a separate email exchange related to the submission of PPQs , the contracting officer  
stated that he would contact the protester ’s POCs for its past performance if the agency 
did not receive submitted PPQs for the references by the January 22, 2025,  deadline.  
Specifically, the contracting officer informed JLC that : 
 
[W]e will reach -out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in 
the blanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as 
many qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.   Page 4    B-423425    
Comments at 12.  
 
The agency received 18 proposals in response to the RFP, including from JLC.  See 
AR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror at 1.  Relevant here, JLC submitted three past performance references  for consideration.  Two of the references were performed 
by a corporate affiliate as a prime contractor, and one project was performed by a joint venture comprised by JLC and its corporate affiliate.  AR, Tab 13, JLC Past Performance Proposal at 2.  The proposal further explained that the corporate affiliate would be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract by providing design management, finance, procurement and logistics of long lead items, and supporting quality control management.  Id.  
 The agency ultimately declined to consider any of JLC’s three references.  It did not 
consider the reference performed by the joint venture because the agency found that the contract  was performed outside of the RFP’s recency period.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of 
Unsuccessful Offeror  at 2.  The agency rejected the other two references because t he 
contracts were performed by an entity other than JLC, and JLC “failed to sufficiently 
explain how [it] contributed to the prime contractor’s performance above and beyond 
subcontracting effort.”  Id. 
 Furthermore, the agency concluded that it did not have sufficient quality assessment information about JLC’s performance of the contracts  because the agency did not 
receive completed PPQs for any of JLC’s  references by the RFP’s prescribed due date.   
Furthermore, the agency represents that it did not reach out to the POCs for the two 
references performed by JLC ’s affiliate  because they were not performed by the 
protester.  See Agency Resp.  to Req. for Supp. Briefing, attach. 1, Decl. of the 
Contracting Offi cer at 1- 2.  As a result, the agency assigned the protester’s past 
performance a rating of neutral confidence.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror 
at 2. 
 Consistent with the agency’s evaluation criteria and basis of award, the agency subsequently selected for award the six proposals that were evaluated as technically acceptable and had a rating of substantial confidence for past performance.  The source 
selection official further  determined that this number of awardees would “bring the best 
competition outcomes for future task orders” and “the awarded vendor pool is still a desirable outcome to meet future task order requirements.”  AR, Tab 16, Source Select ion Decision at 3.  After the agency provided JLC with a debriefing, this protest 
followed.  
  Page 5    B-423425   DISCUSSION 
 JLC presents  two principal  protest issues, both related to how the agency evaluated the 
protester’s  past performance.
4  First, JLC contends that the agency erred when it failed 
to consider the past performance of its corporate affiliate that would have meaningful 
involvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  See, e.g. , Protest at 1.  In 
particular, the protester  argues that the agency improperly categorized the past 
performance of its affiliate  as instances of JLC’s subcontracting experience, which the 
agency would not consider under section L IIID(1)(a)  of the RFP , rather than as past 
performance of an affiliate company, which the agency was to  consider under section 
M IID(1)(b).  Id. at 2. 
 
The agency responds that JLC misinterpreted the meaning of these two solicitation provisions .  Memorandum of Law (MOL)  at 8.  The agency argues while the RFP 
allowed an offeror to provide affiliate past performance, the offeror had to establish “how 
it contributed to [the affiliate’s]  prime contractor performance above and beyond a 
subcontracting effort.”  Id. at 6.  The agency alternatively argues that the sections are in 
“obvious conflict ,” and create a patent ambiguity  that is untimely raised after award.  Id. 
at 8.  In this regard, the agency argues that s ection L IIID(1)(a) excludes all past 
performance from agency consideration except for the offeror’s  own past performance 
as a prime contractor.  Id.  The agency further contends that to the extent section M 
IID(1)(b) provide d that the agency would consider the past performance of entities 
besides the offeror  as a prime contractor, such a reading is in clear contradiction with  
 
4 The protester raises a number of collateral arguments.  While our decision does not 
specifically address each argument, we have reviewed all  of the arguments and find 
that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, JLC argues that it was improperly excluded from award based solely on its neutral past performance confidence rating in a manner contrary to the RFP’s requirement that a neutral confidence rating would not be unfavorably evaluated by the agenc y.  See, e.g. , 
Comments at 13.  We disagree.   
Here, the RFP unambiguously provided that the agency intended to make award to all proposals evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4 at 1.  The record reflects that consistent with the RFP’s unambiguous terms, the source selection official reasonably made award to the six technically acceptable proposals with substantial past performance confidence ratings.  Further, the source selection official ultimately determined that six awards were sufficient to satisfy the government’s requirements and to provide adequate competition at the task order level.  AR, Tab 16, Source Selection Decision at 3.  On this record, we 
disagree with the protester’s argument that the agency was required to consider proposals beyond those that were evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  See Deloitte Consulting, LLP; Softrams, LLC , 
B-421801.2 et al. , Jan. 30, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 41 at 4 n.2 (denying protest ground that 
the agency should have made additional awards where the record reasonably supported the agency’s decision as to the number of contracts awarded).   Page 6    B-423425   the section L provision.  Id.  In either case, the agency contends that it reasonably did 
not consider the corporate affiliate’s past performance references.  
 
Second, JLC argues that  to the extent we agree with its interpretation of the 
solicitation’s provisions discussed above and the agency should have considered its affiliate’s past performance references , the agency  unreasonably  failed to contact the 
POCs provided in JLC’s proposal, despite the contracting officer  representing that he 
would do so in a pre- award email exchange with JLC.  Protest at  2-3.  JLC  ultimately  
concludes that, had the agency included its affiliate’s  past performance and contacted 
the listed POCs when evaluating JLC’s past performance, then JLC would have 
received a past performance rating of substantial confidence and been selected for a 
contract award.  Id. at 3. 
 For the reasons that follow, we agree with the protester ’s interpretation of  the 
solicitation --it did not limit the agency to considering past performance information about 
contracts performed by JLC  itself such that the agency could disregard the information 
about JLC’s affiliate and we reject the agency’s contention that the solicitation was 
patently ambiguous on this point .  Nevertheless , because the protester failed to ensure 
that the agency timely received PPQs for the references --as it was required to do by the 
unambiguous terms of the RFP --the agency reasonably determined that the absence of 
quality information would support JLC’s rating of  neutral confidence and, therefore, the 
protester cannot establish any competitive prejudice.  
 Regarding the question of whether the solicitation precluded the agency from 
consider ing the past performance references of JLC’s affiliate, w here a dispute exists as 
to a solicitation’s actual requirements, we begin by examining the plain language of solicitation.  Harper Constr. Co., Inc. , B-415042, B -415042.2, Nov. 7, 2017, 2018 CPD 
¶ 47 at 4.  We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation by reading the solicitation 
as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a reading.  Desbuild Inc. ,

 If the solicitation language is unambiguous, our inquiry ceases.  Id.  An ambiguity, 
however, exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the solicitation are possible.  Colt Def., LLC , B-406696, July 24, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 302 at 8.  If the 
ambiguity is an obvious, gross, or glaring error in the solicitation then it is a patent ambiguity.   Id.  A patent ambiguity must be protested prior to the closing time for receipt 
of proposals to be considered timely.   Office Design Grp., B -415411, Jan. 3, 2018, 
2018 CPD ¶ 43 at 4.   Here, we conclude that the disputed provisions of the solicitation 
are unambiguous, and the agency’s interpretation is  not reasonable.  
 As stated above,  the RFP’s instructions  provided that “ [t]he offeror shall submit Past 
Performance information for itself as a prime contractor only,” and that “experience  Page 7    B-423425   performing as a subcontractor will not be considered.”  AR, Tab 8,  RFP, amend. 3, 
Section L at 6.  The location of the word “only” in the provision is significant in 
interpreting its plain meaning.   Here, the “only” relates to the requirement that the cited 
past performance must be as a prime contractor.  JLC additionally argues that this 
interpretation is further supported by the next sentence of the instruction, which emphasizes that the agency will not consider subcontractor experience.  In sum, we find the interpretation advanced by the protester is reasonable and comports with the plain meaning of the instruction as written.  
 In contrast, the agency advances an unreasonable interpretation which effectively seeks to move the “only” to relate to the offeror itself.  In this regard, the agency’s interpretation that the instruction limits past performance references only to the offer or 
itself effectively would read the instruction as if it were written as the offeror shall submit past performance information only for itself  as a prime contractor.  We do not believe 
that the agency’s interpretation is consistent with the plain text or import of the instruction.  
 We next consider the evaluation criteria’s provision that the agency would consider the past performance of related entities.  In this regard, the RFP unambiguously states that “[t]he [agency] will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or corporate management if such was provided for evaluation.” AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend.  4, Section M at 3.   The 
provision further provides that in order to rely on such references, the protester must demonstrate “the company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for 
the instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other 
capabilities.”  Id.  The protester contends that the instruction and evaluation criteri on 
can be read in a manner that harmonizes and gives effect to both provisions.  Specifically, JLC contends that the instructions require that each past performance reference have been performed as a prime contractor, and the evaluation criteri on 
makes clear that such references could have been performed either by the offeror or a 
related entity that will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  We agree with the protester that this interpretation is reasonable and prov ides 
effect to both provisions.  
 In contrast, w e disagree with the agency’s alternative interpretation of the two 
provisions, which it  argues imposes a requirement on offerors who include past 
performance of related entities  to have performed itself on those previous contracts 
“above and beyond a subcontracting effort.”  MOL at 6.   In this regard, nothing in the 
evaluation criteria require the offeror to demonstrate its performance on the related entity’s past performance references.   Rather,  the relevant evaluation criteri on required 
that the offeror demonstrate the related entity’s anticipated meaningful involvement on 
the resulting contract.  Nothing in the RFP instructed  offerors  to describe their own 
performance on the past performance references submitted on behalf of related entities , 
let alone establish that such performance was “above and beyond a subcontracting effort.”  Instead, the plain meaning of this provision instructs the opposite:  that offerors 
must describe how the related entity  will perform on the present proposed effor t.  Page 8    B-423425    
In sum, we find that the solicitation’s past performance requirements were not ambiguous and only the protester’s proffered  interpretation is reasonable.  Therefore, 
we agree that the agency erred in failing to consider the past performance references submitted on behalf of JLC’s affiliate that was proposed to be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract.  
 This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry.  Specifically, in addition to finding the rejecting the references because they were submitted on behalf of an affiliate, the 
agency also noted that it never received timely PPQs for the references, and, thus, the lack of quality assessment information would nevertheless support JLC’s neutral confidence past performance assessment.
5  To the extent the agency did not receive 
PPQs, nothing in the solicitation required the agency to affirmatively contact the POCs for the protester’s past performance references.   
 In this regard, Our Office has generally declined to find that an agency has an affirmative obligation to seek out past performance information where the solicitation places the burden on offerors to ensure the timely submission of PPQs.  See, e.g. , 
MicroTechnologies , LLC , B-420196.3, B -420196.4, Jan. 6, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 17 at  9.  
Here, the RFP unambiguously charged offerors with ensuring that the agency timely received completed PPQs from at least POCs per reference.  Specifically, the RFP stated that each offeror was to “exert your best effort  to ensure that at least two (2) 
POCs  per relevant contract submitted a completed [PPQ] directly to the Government 
[no later than] 5:00 p.m. on 22 January 2025 for receipt of proposals,” and that  “[t]he responsibility to send out and track the completion of the [PPQs]  rests solely with 
the offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity) .”  AR, Tab 8, RFP, 
amend.  3, Section L at 7.  
 Notwithstanding the plain terms of the solicitation, the protester nevertheless argues that the contracting officer made representations that he would contact past performance reference POCs in the event PPQs were not timely received.  Specifically, the pr otester points to a pre- award email where the contracting officer represented that 
the agency would:  
 
[R]each- out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in the 
blanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as 
many qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.  
 
 
5 We note that the agency was not obligated to consider a  PPQ that was received 
almost a month after the submission deadline where the RFP clearly established that it was the protester’s responsibility to ensure that the completed PPQs were received by a prescribed deadline.  See ZemiTek, LLC ; Integrated Fed. Solutions, Inc. , B-415313, 
B-415313.2, Dec.  20, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 181 at 10- 11.  Page 9    B-423425   Comments at 12.  
 
For the reasons that follow, we find that the contracting officer’s email, which was not incorporated into the solicitation as an amendment, created a patent ambiguity that needed to be protested prior to the due date for the submission of proposals . 
 Under our Bid Protest Regulations, alleged improprieties in a solicitation apparent prior 
to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals must be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(1).  A written communication 
from a contracting officer that does not amend the solicitation but is directly contrary to the terms of the solicitation creates a patent ambiguity that must be protested in accordance with the timeliness requirements of 4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a) (1).  See, e.g. , 
Harrington, Moran, Barksdale, Inc. , B-401934.2, B -401934.3, Sep. 10, 2010, 2010 CPD 
¶ 231 at 5 (dismissing as untimely a post -award argument that an email from the 
contracting officer created an ambiguity as to the solicitation’s experience requirements); Input Solutions, Inc. , B-294123, Aug. 31, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶  185 at 3- 4 
(same, where the protester alleged that the agency’s written discussions letter superseded the solicitation’s proposal preparation instructions).  
 To the extent the protester contends that the contracting officer’s email exchange relieved the protester of its non- delegable obligation to ensure the timely submission of 
completed PPQs to the agency, such an interpretation would present a patent ambigui ty 
that needed to be protested prior to the closing date for proposals .  On this record, we 
find no basis to conclude that the agency was obligated to contact the protester’s PPQ references, and, therefore, find no basis to sustain the protest where the neutral past 
performance assessment would still be justified based on the lack of any quality related information available for the past performance references of JLC’s affiliate.  
 In conclusion, although we find that the agency improperly evaluated JLC’s past performance when it rejected the past performance of JLC’s  affiliate, we do not find that 
the agency’s error resulted in competitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an 
essential element of every protest, and requires that a protester prove that, but for the agency’s actions, it would have received the award.  Alexandra Constr., Inc. , B-417212, 
Apr. 2, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 132 at 6.  Under the facts here, the protester  did not  suffer  
any competitive prejudice because, even if the agency had properly considered the past 
performance of JLC’s affiliate, the agency still would have lacked the PPQs necessary to assess the quality of JLC’s past performance.  As a result, we do not find that JLC 
would have received a substantial past performance rating in the absence of the 
agency’s error  and, therefore, would not have been in line for award . 
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 Guidehouse Inc., of McLean, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to BDO Public Sector, LLC, (BDO) of McLean, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 70RCSJ24Q00000072, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, 
Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA), for internal control assessment and 
remediation management support services.  The protester contends that the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s and awardee’s quotations was unreasonable, and resulted in a flawed best -value decision.  
 We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423156.2  BACKGROUND  
 
On July 19, 2024, the agency issued the RFQ for the placement of an order under the General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedule, Special Item Number 541219 (Budget and Financial Management Services), for internal control support services for th e CISA Office of Chief Financial Officer Internal Control Subdivision.  
Agency Report (AR), Tab 3.a, Statement of Work (SOW) at 1- 2.  The RFQ, which the 
agency amended once, contemplated issuance of a hybrid fixed- price/time -and-
materials task order with an anticipated task order term of one base year, and two, 1-year options.  Id.  at 2; Contracting Officer’s Statement at 2.  
 The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis 
considering price and three non- price factors (which are listed in descending order of 
importance):  management and staffing approach; past performance; and price.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 9- 10.  When the non- price 
evaluation factors were combined, they were more important than the price factor.  Id.  
at 10.  The RFQ, however, further advised vendors that the agency would not issue an 
award to a vendor  “who presents a considerably higher overall price to achieve only 
slightly better performance capabilities.  Consequently, as non- price evaluations 
become more equal, price may be of greater significance in the trade- off consideration.”  
Id.  Only the past performance factor is relevant to the issues presented in this protest.  
 As to past performance, vendors were to provide up to three past performance references that demonstrated at least two years of experience performing the type of work described in the statement of work (SOW).  Id. at 8.  The past performance 
references needed to include work similar in nature to the requirement and be drawn from work ongoing or completed within the previous five years from the date of RFQ release.   Id. 
 For the past performance factor, the agency would evaluate the relevance of past performance and how well the vendor performed.  Id. at 10.  The agency would consider 
past performance relevant if it was like the solicitation’s requirement in both size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).  Id.  The more relevant the past performance, the stronger predictor of future 
success and, thus, more influence on the past performance risk assessment.  Id.  The 
agency would provide one rating under this factor according to the following scale:    Page 3 B-423156.2  Confidence 
Level Rating  Definition  
Low Risk  The Quoter’s record of past performance indicates there is very little 
risk associated with receiving timely services of the highest quality. 
The Quoter’s past performance shows a pattern of consistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter will likely meet or possibly 
exceed the requirements of the task order.  
Medium Risk  The Quoter’s record of past performance indicates that there is 
some potential risk associated with receiving timely services of the 
highest quality. The Quoter’s past performance reflects instances of inconsistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter may not meet the 
requirements of the task order.  
High Risk  The Quoter’s record of past performance shows a pattern of poor 
past performance, including quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating a high likelihood that the Quoter will 
consistently fail to meet the requirements of the task order.  
Neutral  Quoter has no relevant or recent past performance, or there is no 
record of past performance of Quoter available for evaluation.  
 Id. at 11- 12.  
 The agency received six quotations, including one from the protester and BDO.  See AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 4.  On October 25, 2024, following 
evaluations, the agency notified the protester that it had issued the subject order to 
BDO.  AR, Tab 8, Notice of Award.  In response to Guidehouse’s request for a brief explanation, the agency disclosed the following evaluation results for BDO and 
Guidehouse:  
 
Contractor  Factor 1 
(Management & 
Staffing 
Approach)  Factor 2 (Past 
Performance)  Factor 3 
(Price)  Quoted Price  
BDO  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $10,196,570.06  
Guidehouse  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $13,345,430.25  
 AR, Tab 9, Brief Explanation, at 1.  
 On November 4, Guidehouse filed a protest with our Office, which we docketed as B-423156.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. at 2.  On November 27, the 
agency filed a request to dismiss the protest as academic based on the agency’s 
proposed corrective action to reevaluate quotations and conduct a new best -value 
determination.  AR, Tab 10, Notice of Corrective Action & Req. to Dismiss.  We 
subsequently dismissed the protest as academic .  See Guidehouse, Inc. , B-423156 
(Dec. 3, 2024) (unpublished decision).   Page 4 B-423156.2   
As part of the corrective action, both the technical evaluation team (TET) and business evaluation committee (BEC) met to reevaluate Guidehouse’s and BDO’s quotations under the non- price evaluation factors.   The TET completed its reevaluation and issued 
an updated technical evaluation report for the management and staffing approach; the ratings for this factor did not change.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. 
at 2. 
 As to past performance, the BEC confirmed the prior low risk ratings assigned to both vendors, but also provided a detailed analysis of the recency, relevance, and quality for each past performance reference for each vendor.  In terms of relevance, the BEC  first 
considered the dollar value of the reference, the percentage of work completed by the performing entity (either the prime vendor itself or one of its proposed subcontractors), as well as the number of full -time equivalents employed by the performing entity.  See, 
e.g., AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Perf. Eval. Rep. at 5.  Based on this initial 
relevance analysis, the BEC determined that two of BDO’s past performance references, one for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant, and all three of Guidehouse’s references, two for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant.  See id.  at 10- 11, 28.  
 For each relevant reference, the BEC next considered the percentage of tasks performed under the past performance reference as compared to the tasks required by the SOW for the instant requirement.  A summary of the BEC’s analysis is as follows:  
 
SOW Task  Relevance  
Relevant  Not Relevant  
BDO Reference #1  
Task 1  X (76% of tasks)   
Task 2  X (44% of tasks)   
Task 3  X (100% of tasks)   
Task 4  X (100% of tasks)   
Task 5   X (0% of tasks)  
BDO Reference #3 (for subcontractor)  
Task 1  X (70%)   
Task 2  X (33%)   
Task 3  X (100%)   
Task 4  X (100%)

Id. at 23- 28. 
 In assigning BDO an overall low risk rating, the BEC recognized that, between both of its references, BDO demonstrated relevant experience with the type of work required by 
the SOW, “though relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 [were] on the lighter side as a 
whole.”  Id. at 10.  The BEC, however, explained that the lack of relevant experience 
with some subtasks, while noted, did “not present a genuine concern about ability to perform them,” and that both BDO and its subcontractor had both demonstrated their ability to lead performance related to at least tasks 1 through 4, and BDO’s proposed 
subcontractor had relevant experience performing task 5.  Id. at 10 -11. 
 The source selection official’s subsequent award decision reaffirmed the award to BDO.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 10.  The contracting officer, who was the source selection official, expressly agreed with the BEC’s past performance evaluation findings.  Id.  at 3.  In his tradeoff analysis, the contracting officer 
expressly recognized that Guidehouse, the incumbent, had more relevant past performance and other non- price advantages based on its incumbency, but those 
benefits were not worth a $3.1 million (or 23.6 percent) price premium.  Specifically, the 
contracting officer explained that:  
 While Guidehouse Inc. does show both strong institutional knowledge of CISA’s Internal Controls program (and is the incumbent, automatically presenting less transition risk) and provided more references of performing similar work as a prime contractor, I do not believe this is worth an extra $3.1 [million].  The CISA Internal Controls program has matured, and the  Page 6 B-423156.2  risk of stoppage or complete failure due to transitioning to a new team is 
minimal.  While BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse, their experience was enough to garner a Low Risk rating and the Government has no concerns that BDO has the 
experience to provide quality work.  Therefore, Guidehouse Inc.’s solution is not worth the 23.60 [percent] price premium compared to BDO Public Sector LLC’s Quote.  
 AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.    
 On February 10, 2025, the agency notified Guidehouse that it had confirmed award to BDO.  AR, Tab 15, Second Notice of Award, at 1.  On February 10, the agency provided the protester a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 16, Brief Explanation to Guidehouse at 1.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  Guidehouse raises two primary protest grounds.
1  First, the protester challenges the 
reasonableness of the agency’s past performance evaluation.  Comments at  2.  
Second, the protester argues that the agency’s best -value tradeoff is flawed, contending 
that the agency unreasonably found the awardee to be low risk under the past 
performance factor and that the agency unreasonably elevated the importance of price in making its selection decision.  Id.  at 9.  We find no basis to sustain the protest.  
 Past Performance Evaluation  
 Guidehouse argues that the agency’s past performance evaluation of both the awardee’s and protester’s past performance references was unreasonable.
2  Regarding 
 
1 Guidehouse also initially alleged that (i) the agency misevaluated its proposal under 
the staffing and management approach factor, and (ii) BDO should have received a lower past performance rating based on alleged adverse performance about BDO’s corporate parent, but the protester subsequently withdrew those allegations.  See 
Comments at 1 n.1.  
2 The protester raises other collateral arguments.  While this decision does not 
specifically address all of the protester’s arguments, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  As one example, the protester argues that the agency , 
in assigning the awardee a low risk past performance rating, ignored BDO’s lack of past performance references involving work for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which Guidehouse argues was required by the RFQ.  Comments at 7.  We find no meri t 
to this argument.  First, the relevant past performance evaluation criteria did not specifically limit relevance only to prior work performed for DHS.  In this regard, the RFQ only required offerors to demonstrate past performance that included work “sim ilar 
in nature to this requirement.”  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  As discussed herein, the agency reasonably evaluated past 
(continued...)   Page 7 B-423156.2  the awardee’s quotation, the protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated 
the relevance of BDO’s past performance references and the agency overlooked the risks of BDO’s allegedly limited past performance record.  Comments at 2- 9.  The 
protester also contends that the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s quotation was unreasonable because the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative differences between itself and the awardee’s past performance.  Id.  at 9-11.  The agency maintains 
that its past performance evaluation of both quotations was reasonable and in accordance with the terms of the RFQ, and that the protester’s allegations reflect nothing more than Guidehouse’s disagreement with the agency’s e valuation.  
Memorandum of Law at 3.  As addressed below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  
 When a protester challenges an agency ’s past performance evaluation, we will review 
the evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’ s 
evaluation criteria, and procurement statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency ’s rationale is adequately documented.  D&G Support Services, LLC , B-419245, 
B-419245.3, Jan. 6, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶15 at 8.  An agency ’s evaluation of past 
performance, including its consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of a vendor ’s performance history, is a matter of discretion, which we will not disturb unless 
the agency ’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria.

performance references for relevance considering size, scope, and complexity as compared to the requirements of the SOW.  
Second, we also find no basis for the protester’s intimation that the SOW imposed additional past performance relevance requirements beyond the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency was required to evaluate specific demonstrated knowledge with each of the multitude of federal laws 
and policies enumerated in the SOW, most namely the DHS Financial Accountability Act (DHS FAA).  In support of this position, the protester highlights the section of the 
SOW, which explained that the contractor must possess a comprehensive and working knowledge of federal laws and policies with respect to internal controls, including the 
DHS FAA.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. 1, Updated SOW, at 1- 2.  We do not agree.  
Rather, the agency reasonably considered relevance on the basis of a vendor’s demonstrated experience with federal internal control laws and policies generally, absent a specific solici tation requirement for vendors to demonstrate specific 
experience with each enumerated law or policy.  Additionally, we note that the agency specifically credited Guidehouse in the tradeoff with its “strong institutional knowledge of CISA’s Internal Contro ls program” and depth of experience garnered as the incumbent.  
AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  
   Page 8 B-423156.2  The RFQ instructed vendors to submit up to three past performance references “drawn 
from work ongoing or completed within the previous five (5) years from the date of solicitation release.”  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  The RFQ required the references to include work similar in nature to the requirement.  Id.  Past performance would be considered relevant if it was “like the requirement in 
both size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).” Id.   
 The RFQ explained that the agency would assess each past performance reference to determine the likelihood of the vendor successfully performing the prospective task order.  Id. at 10.  The agency’s assessment would consider whether the past 
performance reference was relevant as well as the reference’s history of quality, schedule, cost control, and management.  Id.  To evaluate relevance, the BEC 
assessed each past performance reference to determine if it demonstrated performance of five of the eight tasks  required by the RFQ.
3  Id.  In addition to the information 
provided, the agency’s evaluation would also consider information provided through 
electronic government databases including, but not limited to, the Contractor 
Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).4  Id.  The agency would then 
determine the level of risk for a vendor’s potential performance based on the vendor’s 
overall relevant past performance.  Id.  
 As discussed above, BDO submitted three past performance references in its quotation, two of which the agency found to be recent and relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13, Past Performance Report at 10.  The BEC, after reviewing the quality information available for these two recent and relevant references, ultimately concluded that BDO’s 
past performance presented low risk to the government.  Specifically, the BEC determined that:  
 
The past performance references were all found to be recent. Reference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 
had too few FTE’s [full -time equivalents] to be considered relevant in size.  
Between all references, relevance in scope to CISA’s requirement was 
 
3 The SOW includes eight tasks:  (1) internal control assessment, corrective action 
planning, and remediation support; (2) data analytics and automation technical support; (3) technical support; (4) project management; (5) audit liaison (optional); (6) surge internal control assessments and remediation special projections (optional); (7) software licenses; and (8) travel.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated SOW, at 2 -8.  
Because task six was identical in scope to tasks one and four, and tasks seven and eight were not to be evaluated under the past performance factor, only the first five tasks were assessed for relevance.  AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Performance Report, at 4 n.1.  
4 The CPARS evaluation consisted of six evaluative areas:  quality; schedule; cost 
control; management; small business subcontracting; regulatory compliance; and other: product/service delivery.  Id. at 6; Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.1503(b)(2).   Page 9 B-423156.2  demonstrated, though relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 are on the lighter 
side as a whole. The lacking relevance in some sub -tasks is noted, but 
does not present a genuine concern about ability to perform them as written in the SOW.  The quality of each refence was found to be positive, 
with each rated factor being given a “Very Good” or “Exceptional” rating.  . . .  Of the two references relevant in size, one was led by BDO as 
the prime and one was led by their proposed subcontractor  [ ] as the 
prime.   While [BDO’s subcontractor]  is the only reference that showed 
performance related to Task 5, both BDO and [BDO’s subcontractor]  
demonstrated leading performance related to tasks 1 –  4.  Due to all 
factors discussed above, we have rated BDO PUBLIC SECTOR, LLC as LOW RISK for this past performance evaluation.  
 Id. at 10- 11.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the BEC’s past 
performance evaluation.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 3.  
 Guidehouse also submitted three past performance references, all three of which the agency found to be relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 28.  With respect to Guidehouse’s past performance references, the evaluators found the following:  
 
The past performance references were found to be recent, relevant in size, and relevant in scope to CISA’s requirement though relevance to 
Task 5 is on the lighter side as a whole.  The lacking relevance in some 
sub-tasks is noted, but does not present a genuine concern about ability to 
perform them as written in the SOW.  Guidehouse led all work as prime in 
the submitted references.  The quality of each refence was found to be 
positive, with each rated factor being given an “Exceptional” rating. 
Therefore,  we have rated GUIDEHOUSE LLP as  LOW RISK for  this past 
performance evaluation.  
 Id.  Based on its review, the agency assigned an overall past performance risk rating of 
“low risk” for Guidehouse.  Id.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the 
BEC’s evaluation of Guidehouse’s past performance.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action 
Award Decision Document at 3.   
 The contracting officer in conducting his tradeoff analysis also expressly recognized that Guidehouse’s past performance was superior to BDO’s past performance.  Specifically, the contracting officer explained that “BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse,” and Guidehouse demonstrated a “strong institutional knowledge of CISA’s Internal Controls program.”  Id.  at 9. 
 In challenging the evaluation of the awardee’s past performance references, the protester first argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated the relevance of each of BDO’s past performance references and that the awardee should have at best, received  Page 10 B-423156.2  an overall rating of “neutral.”5  Comments at 6.  In support of its contention, the protester 
asserts that the awardee’s first reference should not have been evaluated as relevant in 
terms of scope because, by the agency’s own account, BDO did not demonstrate relevant work for a majority  of the sub- tasks under tasks two and five.  Id. at 3-5.  The 
protester also argues that BDO’s third reference should not have been considered because it was noncompliant with the RFQ’s instructions --the reference consisted of 
two separate task orders and, thus, exceeded the maximum limit of submittable past performance references.  Id. at 5-6.   
 The agency responds that its evaluation of BDO’s past performance was reasonable, referencing multiple ways in which the contemporaneous evaluation record shows that BDO’s references exhibited work relevant to the five measured tasks, and argues that the protester’s assertions amount to disagreement with its conclusions.  Agency Supp. Briefing at 4- 7.  The agency further contends that it reasonably considered the totality of 
past performance information when assessing risk, as opposed to requiring each reference to independently demonstrate experience with all five SOW tasks.  For 
example, the agency similarly found Guidehouse’s second reference relevant even though it did not reflect experience relevant to task 5 and only demonstrated relevant experience wi th some subtasks under tasks 1 and 2.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective 
Action Past Performance Report, at 7- 8.  The agency also argues that it found the 
awardee’s third past performance reference compliant with the terms of the RFQ and reasonably considered the reference during the agency’s past performance evaluation.  
Agency Supp. Briefing at  9-11. 
 
We find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation of BDO’s first past performance 
reference.  In accordance with the RFQ, the agency considered the reference’s 
relevance in terms of the size and number of FTEs employed, and the scope of the 
tasks and subtasks required under the RFQ .  Regarding the scope analysis, the agency 
found the reference reflected work that was relevant to four of the five measured tasks.  
AR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 4.  More specifically , the 
agency ack nowledged the reference’s lack of relevance to certain aspects of tasks 2  
and 5, but overall assessed the reference to be relevant in size and scope.  Id.  at 10- 11; 
See PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ; IBM U.S. Federal , B-409885 et al. , Sept. 5, 2014, 
2014 CPD ¶  289 at 10 (agency reasonably considered identified contracts similar in 
either size, scope, or complexity, and the solicitation did not require that each past performance reference meet all of the relevance criteria in order to be considered).  On 
 
5 The protester, in addition to its arguments regarding the awardee’s first and third 
references, argues that the agency improperly considered BDO’s second reference.  As noted above, however, the past performance report and award decision document make clear that the agency did not consider BDO’s second reference to be relevant in size and did not consider the reference in its evaluation.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 13, 
Corrective Action Past Performance Report, at 10 (“Reference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 had too few FTE’s to be considered relevant in size.”).  Because this argument is based on a factual inaccuracy inconsistent with the contemporaneous evaluation record, we do not address it further.    Page 11 B-423156.2  this record, the agency reasonably considered the relevance of the reference, 
concluding that it demonstrated a substantially similar scope to warrant a rating of relevant.  The protester’s argument that the reference should not be considered relevant because of the agency’s findings regarding tasks 2  and 5 is no more than disagreement 
with the agency’s judgment.  
 The protester  argues that BDO submitted more than three past performance references, 
in contravention of the RFQ.  Specifically, Guidehouse argues that BDO’s  third past 
performance reference consists of two separate past performance references , which, 
when counted with the other two past performance references,  exceeded the three 
reference limit set forth in the RFQ .  Supp. Briefing at 4.  To support its argument, the 
protester notes that the third reference consist s of two separate task orders  placed 
under  an indefinite- delivery indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract with each separate order 
involv ing different scopes of wor k, periods of performance, and numbers of FTEs.  Id.  
at 5.  We are not persuaded by the protester’s argument .  Nothing in the RFQ 
establishes that a single reference for an IDIQ contract would be evaluated with respect to individual orders placed under the IDIQ contract.  Absent such a provision, the record reflects the agency reasonably concluded that the second order was a logical “follow -
on” effort for the same scope of the work performed under the first order, and thus reflected a singular effort across the period of both orders.   AR, Tab 13, Corrective 
Action Past Performance Report, at 10- 11.  Because the terms of the RFQ did not 
require the agency to classify the protester’s third reference as two separate references , 
this protest ground is denied.
6 
 The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative 
differences between the protester’s and awardee’s past performance records.  Supp. 
Briefing at 8.  In this regard, the protester argues that it should have received a higher rating than the awardee because the protester’s references were more relevant, showed DHS -specific experience as a prime contractor, and were for a larger dollar 
value which required more FTEs to perform.  Id.  at 8-9.  
 
 
6 Even assuming for the sake of argument that the agency should only have considered 
one of the two related, sequential orders, we cannot discern any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice where either order, standing alone, would arguably be relev ant 
in terms of the size and number of FTEs employed as compared to the requirements of this procurement.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evidence, we will not sustain a protest, ev en 
where a protester may have shown that an agency’s actions were arguably improper.  Interfor US, Inc. , B-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD ¶ 19 at 7.  Here, the number of 
FTEs and the size of the effort, when adjusting for the different periods of performance of this requirement and the challenged reference, would be comparable to this requirement for either of the orders at issue.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past 
Performance Report, at 8.  Thus, on this record, we can discern no reasonable possibility of prejudice even if we were to accept the protester’s argument, and therefore, find no basis on which to sustain the protest.   Page 12 B-423156.2  We find Guidehouse’s assertion that the agency’s evaluation of its past performance 
was unreasonable to be unsupported by the record.  As noted above, the agency established “low risk” as the highest rating for past performance.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. N o. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 11- 12.  Where, as here, a protester 
complains that its quotation should have been assigned a higher rating than the highest rating available under the terms of the RFQ, its fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See, e.g. , Hendall, Inc. , B-417513.3, B-417513.4, Feb. 24, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 87 
at 9-10 (where a solicitation defines the highest possible past performance rating and 
the protester receives that rating, the protester ’s assertion that it should have received 
greater credit than the solicitation contemplated fails to state a valid basis of 
protest);   22nd Century Techs., Inc. --Recon. , B-416669.7, Nov. 14, 2019, 2019 CPD 
¶ 385 at 4 (same) .  Beyond its disagreement as to the adjectival ratings assigned to the 
quotations , the protester’s argument also ignores the contemporaneous record, which 
reflects that the BEC and contracting officer expressly recognized Guidehouse’s superior past performance.  As noted, the contracting officer’s award decision expressly recognized that “BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse.”  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Thus, the protester’s argument that the agency failed to consider qualitative differences between the vendors’ past performance selectively ignores the contemporaneous record.  
 In sum, we find the agency’s past performance evaluation of both vendors to be both well-reasoned and thoroughly documented.  Accordingly, we find no reason to question 
the agency’s evaluation judgments as to the relevance and quality of either  vendor ’s 
past performance.  See D&G Support Services, LLC, supra at 9 (an agency ’s evaluation 
of past performance is, by its nature, subjective, and that evaluation, including the agency ’s assessments of relevance, scope, and significance, are matters of discretion 
that we will not disturb absent a clear demonstration that the assessments are 
unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria); see also FN Mfg., LLC, supra 
at 7 (a protester's disagreement with the agency ’s judgment , without more,  does not 
establish that an evaluation was unreasonable).  
 Best-Value Determination  
 The protester also contends that the agency conducted a flawed best -value 
determination because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable underlying past performance evaluation.  The protester also contends that a reasonable tradeoff would have considered Guidehouse’s superior past performance worth the associated price 
premium in light of the solicitation’s evaluation scheme where the non- price factors were 
more important than price.  Supp. Briefing at 10.  We find no basis on which to sustain the protest .   
 Source selection officials in best -value procurements have broad discretion in making 
price/technical tradeoffs, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governed only by the tests of rationality and consistency with the solicitation’ s 
evaluation criteria.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, B -422823.2, Nov. 18, 2024,  Page 13 B-423156.2  2024 CPD ¶ 272 at 8.  An agency may properly select a lower -rated, lower -priced 
quotation or proposal where it reasonably concludes that the price premium involved in 
selecting a higher -rated quotation or proposal is not justified in light of the acceptabl e 
level of technical competence available at a lower price, even where price is the least important factor.  Id.; Angel Menedez Envt’l Servs., Inc., B -310340.2, Apr. 11, 2008, 
2008 CPD ¶ 73 at 3 n.1.  
 As addressed above, the agency reasonably evaluated the vendors’ past performance, and the contracting officer expressly considered the unique strengths offered by Guidehouse’s quotation.  Specifically, the tradeoff expressly recognized that Guidehouse dem onstrated strong institutional knowledge, presented less transition risk 
as the incumbent, and had more in- depth past performance than BDO.  AR, Tab 14, 
Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Ultimately, however, the contracting officer did not believe t he protester’s evaluated advantages warranted a $3.1 million (or more than 
26 percent) price premium because the risk of stoppage or complete failure during transition was low, and the agency had no concerns about whether BDO had the experience necessary t o provide quality work.  Id.  In short, the record disproves the 
protester’s assertation that the agency did not look behind the adjectival ratings and credit Guidehouse for its superior past performance.  The protester’s disagreement with the source selec tion official’s subjective business judgment as to the competing merits 
of the quotations and ultimate price/technical tradeoff, without more, does not render the tradeoff decision unreasonable.  Preferred Sys. Solutions, B -291750, Feb. 24, 2003, 
2003 CPD ¶ 56 at 5.  Because the agency’s determination was reasonable, consistent with the RFQ and applicable procurement laws and regulations, we find no basis to sustain the protest.

DECISION  
 Guidehouse Inc., of McLean, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to BDO Public Sector, LLC, (BDO) of McLean, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 70RCSJ24Q00000072, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, 
Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA), for internal control assessment and 
remediation management support services.  The protester contends that the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s and awardee’s quotations was unreasonable, and resulted in a flawed best -value decision.  
 We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423156.2  BACKGROUND  
 
On July 19, 2024, the agency issued the RFQ for the placement of an order under the General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedule, Special Item Number 541219 (Budget and Financial Management Services), for internal control support services for th e CISA Office of Chief Financial Officer Internal Control Subdivision.  
Agency Report (AR), Tab 3.a, Statement of Work (SOW) at 1- 2.  The RFQ, which the 
agency amended once, contemplated issuance of a hybrid fixed- price/time -and-
materials task order with an anticipated task order term of one base year, and two, 1-year options.  Id.  at 2; Contracting Officer’s Statement at 2.  
 The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis 
considering price and three non- price factors (which are listed in descending order of 
importance):  management and staffing approach; past performance; and price.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 9- 10.  When the non- price 
evaluation factors were combined, they were more important than the price factor.  Id.  
at 10.  The RFQ, however, further advised vendors that the agency would not issue an 
award to a vendor  “who presents a considerably higher overall price to achieve only 
slightly better performance capabilities.  Consequently, as non- price evaluations 
become more equal, price may be of greater significance in the trade- off consideration.”  
Id.  Only the past performance factor is relevant to the issues presented in this protest.  
 As to past performance, vendors were to provide up to three past performance references that demonstrated at least two years of experience performing the type of work described in the statement of work (SOW).  Id. at 8.  The past performance 
references needed to include work similar in nature to the requirement and be drawn from work ongoing or completed within the previous five years from the date of RFQ release.   Id. 
 For the past performance factor, the agency would evaluate the relevance of past performance and how well the vendor performed.  Id. at 10.  The agency would consider 
past performance relevant if it was like the solicitation’s requirement in both size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).  Id.  The more relevant the past performance, the stronger predictor of future 
success and, thus, more influence on the past performance risk assessment.  Id.  The 
agency would provide one rating under this factor according to the following scale:    Page 3 B-423156.2  Confidence 
Level Rating  Definition  
Low Risk  The Quoter’s record of past performance indicates there is very little 
risk associated with receiving timely services of the highest quality. 
The Quoter’s past performance shows a pattern of consistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter will likely meet or possibly 
exceed the requirements of the task order.  
Medium Risk  The Quoter’s record of past performance indicates that there is 
some potential risk associated with receiving timely services of the 
highest quality. The Quoter’s past performance reflects instances of inconsistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter may not meet the 
requirements of the task order.  
High Risk  The Quoter’s record of past performance shows a pattern of poor 
past performance, including quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating a high likelihood that the Quoter will 
consistently fail to meet the requirements of the task order.  
Neutral  Quoter has no relevant or recent past performance, or there is no 
record of past performance of Quoter available for evaluation.  
 Id. at 11- 12.  
 The agency received six quotations, including one from the protester and BDO.  See AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 4.  On October 25, 2024, following 
evaluations, the agency notified the protester that it had issued the subject order to 
BDO.  AR, Tab 8, Notice of Award.  In response to Guidehouse’s request for a brief explanation, the agency disclosed the following evaluation results for BDO and 
Guidehouse:  
 
Contractor  Factor 1 
(Management & 
Staffing 
Approach)  Factor 2 (Past 
Performance)  Factor 3 
(Price)  Quoted Price  
BDO  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $10,196,570.06  
Guidehouse  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $13,345,430.25  
 AR, Tab 9, Brief Explanation, at 1.  
 On November 4, Guidehouse filed a protest with our Office, which we docketed as B-423156.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. at 2.  On November 27, the 
agency filed a request to dismiss the protest as academic based on the agency’s 
proposed corrective action to reevaluate quotations and conduct a new best -value 
determination.  AR, Tab 10, Notice of Corrective Action & Req. to Dismiss.  We 
subsequently dismissed the protest as academic .  See Guidehouse, Inc. , B-423156 
(Dec. 3, 2024) (unpublished decision).   Page 4 B-423156.2   
As part of the corrective action, both the technical evaluation team (TET) and business evaluation committee (BEC) met to reevaluate Guidehouse’s and BDO’s quotations under the non- price evaluation factors.   The TET completed its reevaluation and issued 
an updated technical evaluation report for the management and staffing approach; the ratings for this factor did not change.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. 
at 2. 
 As to past performance, the BEC confirmed the prior low risk ratings assigned to both vendors, but also provided a detailed analysis of the recency, relevance, and quality for each past performance reference for each vendor.  In terms of relevance, the BEC  first 
considered the dollar value of the reference, the percentage of work completed by the performing entity (either the prime vendor itself or one of its proposed subcontractors), as well as the number of full -time equivalents employed by the performing entity.  See, 
e.g., AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Perf. Eval. Rep. at 5.  Based on this initial 
relevance analysis, the BEC determined that two of BDO’s past performance references, one for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant, and all three of Guidehouse’s references, two for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant.  See id.  at 10- 11, 28.  
 For each relevant reference, the BEC next considered the percentage of tasks performed under the past performance reference as compared to the tasks required by the SOW for the instant requirement.  A summary of the BEC’s analysis is as follows:  
 
SOW Task  Relevance  
Relevant  Not Relevant  
BDO Reference #1  
Task 1  X (76% of tasks)   
Task 2  X (44% of tasks)   
Task 3  X (100% of tasks)   
Task 4  X (100% of tasks)   
Task 5   X (0% of tasks)  
BDO Reference #3 (for subcontractor)  
Task 1  X (70%)   
Task 2  X (33%)   
Task 3  X (100%)   
Task 4  X (100%)

Id. at 23- 28. 
 In assigning BDO an overall low risk rating, the BEC recognized that, between both of its references, BDO demonstrated relevant experience with the type of work required by 
the SOW, “though relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 [were] on the lighter side as a 
whole.”  Id. at 10.  The BEC, however, explained that the lack of relevant experience 
with some subtasks, while noted, did “not present a genuine concern about ability to perform them,” and that both BDO and its subcontractor had both demonstrated their ability to lead performance related to at least tasks 1 through 4, and BDO’s proposed 
subcontractor had relevant experience performing task 5.  Id. at 10 -11. 
 The source selection official’s subsequent award decision reaffirmed the award to BDO.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 10.  The contracting officer, who was the source selection official, expressly agreed with the BEC’s past performance evaluation findings.  Id.  at 3.  In his tradeoff analysis, the contracting officer 
expressly recognized that Guidehouse, the incumbent, had more relevant past performance and other non- price advantages based on its incumbency, but those 
benefits were not worth a $3.1 million (or 23.6 percent) price premium.  Specifically, the 
contracting officer explained that:  
 While Guidehouse Inc. does show both strong institutional knowledge of CISA’s Internal Controls program (and is the incumbent, automatically presenting less transition risk) and provided more references of performing similar work as a prime contractor, I do not believe this is worth an extra $3.1 [million].  The CISA Internal Controls program has matured, and the  Page 6 B-423156.2  risk of stoppage or complete failure due to transitioning to a new team is 
minimal.  While BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse, their experience was enough to garner a Low Risk rating and the Government has no concerns that BDO has the 
experience to provide quality work.  Therefore, Guidehouse Inc.’s solution is not worth the 23.60 [percent] price premium compared to BDO Public Sector LLC’s Quote.  
 AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.    
 On February 10, 2025, the agency notified Guidehouse that it had confirmed award to BDO.  AR, Tab 15, Second Notice of Award, at 1.  On February 10, the agency provided the protester a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 16, Brief Explanation to Guidehouse at 1.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  Guidehouse raises two primary protest grounds.
1  First, the protester challenges the 
reasonableness of the agency’s past performance evaluation.  Comments at  2.  
Second, the protester argues that the agency’s best -value tradeoff is flawed, contending 
that the agency unreasonably found the awardee to be low risk under the past 
performance factor and that the agency unreasonably elevated the importance of price in making its selection decision.  Id.  at 9.  We find no basis to sustain the protest.  
 Past Performance Evaluation  
 Guidehouse argues that the agency’s past performance evaluation of both the awardee’s and protester’s past performance references was unreasonable.
2  Regarding 
 
1 Guidehouse also initially alleged that (i) the agency misevaluated its proposal under 
the staffing and management approach factor, and (ii) BDO should have received a lower past performance rating based on alleged adverse performance about BDO’s corporate parent, but the protester subsequently withdrew those allegations.  See 
Comments at 1 n.1.  
2 The protester raises other collateral arguments.  While this decision does not 
specifically address all of the protester’s arguments, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  As one example, the protester argues that the agency , 
in assigning the awardee a low risk past performance rating, ignored BDO’s lack of past performance references involving work for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which Guidehouse argues was required by the RFQ.  Comments at 7.  We find no meri t 
to this argument.  First, the relevant past performance evaluation criteria did not specifically limit relevance only to prior work performed for DHS.  In this regard, the RFQ only required offerors to demonstrate past performance that included work “sim ilar 
in nature to this requirement.”  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  As discussed herein, the agency reasonably evaluated past 
(continued...)   Page 7 B-423156.2  the awardee’s quotation, the protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated 
the relevance of BDO’s past performance references and the agency overlooked the risks of BDO’s allegedly limited past performance record.  Comments at 2- 9.  The 
protester also contends that the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s quotation was unreasonable because the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative differences between itself and the awardee’s past performance.  Id.  at 9-11.  The agency maintains 
that its past performance evaluation of both quotations was reasonable and in accordance with the terms of the RFQ, and that the protester’s allegations reflect nothing more than Guidehouse’s disagreement with the agency’s e valuation.  
Memorandum of Law at 3.  As addressed below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  
 When a protester challenges an agency ’s past performance evaluation, we will review 
the evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’ s 
evaluation criteria, and procurement statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency ’s rationale is adequately documented.  D&G Support Services, LLC , B-419245, 
B-419245.3, Jan. 6, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶15 at 8.  An agency ’s evaluation of past 
performance, including its consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of a vendor ’s performance history, is a matter of discretion, which we will not disturb unless 
the agency ’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria.

performance references for relevance considering size, scope, and complexity as compared to the requirements of the SOW.  
Second, we also find no basis for the protester’s intimation that the SOW imposed additional past performance relevance requirements beyond the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency was required to evaluate specific demonstrated knowledge with each of the multitude of federal laws 
and policies enumerated in the SOW, most namely the DHS Financial Accountability Act (DHS FAA).  In support of this position, the protester highlights the section of the 
SOW, which explained that the contractor must possess a comprehensive and working knowledge of federal laws and policies with respect to internal controls, including the 
DHS FAA.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. 1, Updated SOW, at 1- 2.  We do not agree.  
Rather, the agency reasonably considered relevance on the basis of a vendor’s demonstrated experience with federal internal control laws and policies generally, absent a specific solici tation requirement for vendors to demonstrate specific 
experience with each enumerated law or policy.  Additionally, we note that the agency specifically credited Guidehouse in the tradeoff with its “strong institutional knowledge of CISA’s Internal Contro ls program” and depth of experience garnered as the incumbent.  
AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  
   Page 8 B-423156.2  The RFQ instructed vendors to submit up to three past performance references “drawn 
from work ongoing or completed within the previous five (5) years from the date of solicitation release.”  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  The RFQ required the references to include work similar in nature to the requirement.  Id.  Past performance would be considered relevant if it was “like the requirement in 
both size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).” Id.   
 The RFQ explained that the agency would assess each past performance reference to determine the likelihood of the vendor successfully performing the prospective task order.  Id. at 10.  The agency’s assessment would consider whether the past 
performance reference was relevant as well as the reference’s history of quality, schedule, cost control, and management.  Id.  To evaluate relevance, the BEC 
assessed each past performance reference to determine if it demonstrated performance of five of the eight tasks  required by the RFQ.
3  Id.  In addition to the information 
provided, the agency’s evaluation would also consider information provided through 
electronic government databases including, but not limited to, the Contractor 
Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).4  Id.  The agency would then 
determine the level of risk for a vendor’s potential performance based on the vendor’s 
overall relevant past performance.  Id.  
 As discussed above, BDO submitted three past performance references in its quotation, two of which the agency found to be recent and relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13, Past Performance Report at 10.  The BEC, after reviewing the quality information available for these two recent and relevant references, ultimately concluded that BDO’s 
past performance presented low risk to the government.  Specifically, the BEC determined that:  
 
The past performance references were all found to be recent. Reference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 
had too few FTE’s [full -time equivalents] to be considered relevant in size.  
Between all references, relevance in scope to CISA’s requirement was 
 
3 The SOW includes eight tasks:  (1) internal control assessment, corrective action 
planning, and remediation support; (2) data analytics and automation technical support; (3) technical support; (4) project management; (5) audit liaison (optional); (6) surge internal control assessments and remediation special projections (optional); (7) software licenses; and (8) travel.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated SOW, at 2 -8.  
Because task six was identical in scope to tasks one and four, and tasks seven and eight were not to be evaluated under the past performance factor, only the first five tasks were assessed for relevance.  AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Performance Report, at 4 n.1.  
4 The CPARS evaluation consisted of six evaluative areas:  quality; schedule; cost 
control; management; small business subcontracting; regulatory compliance; and other: product/service delivery.  Id. at 6; Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.1503(b)(2).   Page 9 B-423156.2  demonstrated, though relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 are on the lighter 
side as a whole. The lacking relevance in some sub -tasks is noted, but 
does not present a genuine concern about ability to perform them as written in the SOW.  The quality of each refence was found to be positive, 
with each rated factor being given a “Very Good” or “Exceptional” rating.  . . .  Of the two references relevant in size, one was led by BDO as 
the prime and one was led by their proposed subcontractor  [ ] as the 
prime.   While [BDO’s subcontractor]  is the only reference that showed 
performance related to Task 5, both BDO and [BDO’s subcontractor]  
demonstrated leading performance related to tasks 1 –  4.  Due to all 
factors discussed above, we have rated BDO PUBLIC SECTOR, LLC as LOW RISK for this past performance evaluation.  
 Id. at 10- 11.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the BEC’s past 
performance evaluation.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 3.  
 Guidehouse also submitted three past performance references, all three of which the agency found to be relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 28.  With respect to Guidehouse’s past performance references, the evaluators found the following:  
 
The past performance references were found to be recent, relevant in size, and relevant in scope to CISA’s requirement though relevance to 
Task 5 is on the lighter side as a whole.  The lacking relevance in some 
sub-tasks is noted, but does not present a genuine concern about ability to 
perform them as written in the SOW.  Guidehouse led all work as prime in 
the submitted references.  The quality of each refence was found to be 
positive, with each rated factor being given an “Exceptional” rating. 
Therefore,  we have rated GUIDEHOUSE LLP as  LOW RISK for  this past 
performance evaluation.  
 Id.  Based on its review, the agency assigned an overall past performance risk rating of 
“low risk” for Guidehouse.  Id.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the 
BEC’s evaluation of Guidehouse’s past performance.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action 
Award Decision Document at 3.   
 The contracting officer in conducting his tradeoff analysis also expressly recognized that Guidehouse’s past performance was superior to BDO’s past performance.  Specifically, the contracting officer explained that “BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse,” and Guidehouse demonstrated a “strong institutional knowledge of CISA’s Internal Controls program.”  Id.  at 9. 
 In challenging the evaluation of the awardee’s past performance references, the protester first argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated the relevance of each of BDO’s past performance references and that the awardee should have at best, received  Page 10 B-423156.2  an overall rating of “neutral.”5  Comments at 6.  In support of its contention, the protester 
asserts that the awardee’s first reference should not have been evaluated as relevant in 
terms of scope because, by the agency’s own account, BDO did not demonstrate relevant work for a majority  of the sub- tasks under tasks two and five.  Id. at 3-5.  The 
protester also argues that BDO’s third reference should not have been considered because it was noncompliant with the RFQ’s instructions --the reference consisted of 
two separate task orders and, thus, exceeded the maximum limit of submittable past performance references.  Id. at 5-6.   
 The agency responds that its evaluation of BDO’s past performance was reasonable, referencing multiple ways in which the contemporaneous evaluation record shows that BDO’s references exhibited work relevant to the five measured tasks, and argues that the protester’s assertions amount to disagreement with its conclusions.  Agency Supp. Briefing at 4- 7.  The agency further contends that it reasonably considered the totality of 
past performance information when assessing risk, as opposed to requiring each reference to independently demonstrate experience with all five SOW tasks.  For 
example, the agency similarly found Guidehouse’s second reference relevant even though it did not reflect experience relevant to task 5 and only demonstrated relevant experience wi th some subtasks under tasks 1 and 2.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective 
Action Past Performance Report, at 7- 8.  The agency also argues that it found the 
awardee’s third past performance reference compliant with the terms of the RFQ and reasonably considered the reference during the agency’s past performance evaluation.  
Agency Supp. Briefing at  9-11. 
 
We find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation of BDO’s first past performance 
reference.  In accordance with the RFQ, the agency considered the reference’s 
relevance in terms of the size and number of FTEs employed, and the scope of the 
tasks and subtasks required under the RFQ .  Regarding the scope analysis, the agency 
found the reference reflected work that was relevant to four of the five measured tasks.  
AR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 4.  More specifically , the 
agency ack nowledged the reference’s lack of relevance to certain aspects of tasks 2  
and 5, but overall assessed the reference to be relevant in size and scope.  Id.  at 10- 11; 
See PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ; IBM U.S. Federal , B-409885 et al. , Sept. 5, 2014, 
2014 CPD ¶  289 at 10 (agency reasonably considered identified contracts similar in 
either size, scope, or complexity, and the solicitation did not require that each past performance reference meet all of the relevance criteria in order to be considered).  On 
 
5 The protester, in addition to its arguments regarding the awardee’s first and third 
references, argues that the agency improperly considered BDO’s second reference.  As noted above, however, the past performance report and award decision document make clear that the agency did not consider BDO’s second reference to be relevant in size and did not consider the reference in its evaluation.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 13, 
Corrective Action Past Performance Report, at 10 (“Reference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 had too few FTE’s to be considered relevant in size.”).  Because this argument is based on a factual inaccuracy inconsistent with the contemporaneous evaluation record, we do not address it further.    Page 11 B-423156.2  this record, the agency reasonably considered the relevance of the reference, 
concluding that it demonstrated a substantially similar scope to warrant a rating of relevant.  The protester’s argument that the reference should not be considered relevant because of the agency’s findings regarding tasks 2  and 5 is no more than disagreement 
with the agency’s judgment.  
 The protester  argues that BDO submitted more than three past performance references, 
in contravention of the RFQ.  Specifically, Guidehouse argues that BDO’s  third past 
performance reference consists of two separate past performance references , which, 
when counted with the other two past performance references,  exceeded the three 
reference limit set forth in the RFQ .  Supp. Briefing at 4.  To support its argument, the 
protester notes that the third reference consist s of two separate task orders  placed 
under  an indefinite- delivery indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract with each separate order 
involv ing different scopes of wor k, periods of performance, and numbers of FTEs.  Id.  
at 5.  We are not persuaded by the protester’s argument .  Nothing in the RFQ 
establishes that a single reference for an IDIQ contract would be evaluated with respect to individual orders placed under the IDIQ contract.  Absent such a provision, the record reflects the agency reasonably concluded that the second order was a logical “follow -
on” effort for the same scope of the work performed under the first order, and thus reflected a singular effort across the period of both orders.   AR, Tab 13, Corrective 
Action Past Performance Report, at 10- 11.  Because the terms of the RFQ did not 
require the agency to classify the protester’s third reference as two separate references , 
this protest ground is denied.
6 
 The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative 
differences between the protester’s and awardee’s past performance records.  Supp. 
Briefing at 8.  In this regard, the protester argues that it should have received a higher rating than the awardee because the protester’s references were more relevant, showed DHS -specific experience as a prime contractor, and were for a larger dollar 
value which required more FTEs to perform.  Id.  at 8-9.  
 
 
6 Even assuming for the sake of argument that the agency should only have considered 
one of the two related, sequential orders, we cannot discern any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice where either order, standing alone, would arguably be relev ant 
in terms of the size and number of FTEs employed as compared to the requirements of this procurement.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evidence, we will not sustain a protest, ev en 
where a protester may have shown that an agency’s actions were arguably improper.  Interfor US, Inc. , B-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD ¶ 19 at 7.  Here, the number of 
FTEs and the size of the effort, when adjusting for the different periods of performance of this requirement and the challenged reference, would be comparable to this requirement for either of the orders at issue.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past 
Performance Report, at 8.  Thus, on this record, we can discern no reasonable possibility of prejudice even if we were to accept the protester’s argument, and therefore, find no basis on which to sustain the protest.   Page 12 B-423156.2  We find Guidehouse’s assertion that the agency’s evaluation of its past performance 
was unreasonable to be unsupported by the record.  As noted above, the agency established “low risk” as the highest rating for past performance.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. N o. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 11- 12.  Where, as here, a protester 
complains that its quotation should have been assigned a higher rating than the highest rating available under the terms of the RFQ, its fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See, e.g. , Hendall, Inc. , B-417513.3, B-417513.4, Feb. 24, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 87 
at 9-10 (where a solicitation defines the highest possible past performance rating and 
the protester receives that rating, the protester ’s assertion that it should have received 
greater credit than the solicitation contemplated fails to state a valid basis of 
protest);   22nd Century Techs., Inc. --Recon. , B-416669.7, Nov. 14, 2019, 2019 CPD 
¶ 385 at 4 (same) .  Beyond its disagreement as to the adjectival ratings assigned to the 
quotations , the protester’s argument also ignores the contemporaneous record, which 
reflects that the BEC and contracting officer expressly recognized Guidehouse’s superior past performance.  As noted, the contracting officer’s award decision expressly recognized that “BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse.”  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Thus, the protester’s argument that the agency failed to consider qualitative differences between the vendors’ past performance selectively ignores the contemporaneous record.  
 In sum, we find the agency’s past performance evaluation of both vendors to be both well-reasoned and thoroughly documented.  Accordingly, we find no reason to question 
the agency’s evaluation judgments as to the relevance and quality of either  vendor ’s 
past performance.  See D&G Support Services, LLC, supra at 9 (an agency ’s evaluation 
of past performance is, by its nature, subjective, and that evaluation, including the agency ’s assessments of relevance, scope, and significance, are matters of discretion 
that we will not disturb absent a clear demonstration that the assessments are 
unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria); see also FN Mfg., LLC, supra 
at 7 (a protester's disagreement with the agency ’s judgment , without more,  does not 
establish that an evaluation was unreasonable).  
 Best-Value Determination  
 The protester also contends that the agency conducted a flawed best -value 
determination because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable underlying past performance evaluation.  The protester also contends that a reasonable tradeoff would have considered Guidehouse’s superior past performance worth the associated price 
premium in light of the solicitation’s evaluation scheme where the non- price factors were 
more important than price.  Supp. Briefing at 10.  We find no basis on which to sustain the protest .   
 Source selection officials in best -value procurements have broad discretion in making 
price/technical tradeoffs, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governed only by the tests of rationality and consistency with the solicitation’ s 
evaluation criteria.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, B -422823.2, Nov. 18, 2024,  Page 13 B-423156.2  2024 CPD ¶ 272 at 8.  An agency may properly select a lower -rated, lower -priced 
quotation or proposal where it reasonably concludes that the price premium involved in 
selecting a higher -rated quotation or proposal is not justified in light of the acceptabl e 
level of technical competence available at a lower price, even where price is the least important factor.  Id.; Angel Menedez Envt’l Servs., Inc., B -310340.2, Apr. 11, 2008, 
2008 CPD ¶ 73 at 3 n.1.  
 As addressed above, the agency reasonably evaluated the vendors’ past performance, and the contracting officer expressly considered the unique strengths offered by Guidehouse’s quotation.  Specifically, the tradeoff expressly recognized that Guidehouse dem onstrated strong institutional knowledge, presented less transition risk 
as the incumbent, and had more in- depth past performance than BDO.  AR, Tab 14, 
Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Ultimately, however, the contracting officer did not believe t he protester’s evaluated advantages warranted a $3.1 million (or more than 
26 percent) price premium because the risk of stoppage or complete failure during transition was low, and the agency had no concerns about whether BDO had the experience necessary t o provide quality work.  Id.  In short, the record disproves the 
protester’s assertation that the agency did not look behind the adjectival ratings and credit Guidehouse for its superior past performance.  The protester’s disagreement with the source selec tion official’s subjective business judgment as to the competing merits 
of the quotations and ultimate price/technical tradeoff, without more, does not render the tradeoff decision unreasonable.  Preferred Sys. Solutions, B -291750, Feb. 24, 2003, 
2003 CPD ¶ 56 at 5.  Because the agency’s determination was reasonable, consistent with the RFQ and applicable procurement laws and regulations, we find no basis to sustain the protest.

B-423326.2,"July 7, 2025","Wright Brothers Aero, Inc","Protest that agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee’s proposal is dismissed as 
untimely where the protester filed the protest more than 10 days after the firm knew or should have known the basis of protest.  
DECISION  
 Wright Brothers Aero, Inc., a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, protests the award of a contract to Premier Jet Services DAY, LLC, a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, under solicitation No. SPE607 -24-R- 0200, issued by the Defense Logistics Agency for aircr aft 
refueling at James M . Cox Dayton International Airport  (KDAY)  in Dayton, Ohio.  The 
protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee’s  proposal and 
failed to reasonably and properly implement corrective action in response to a prior protest.  
 We dismiss the protest because it is untimely.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on June 13, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, for 723,060 gallons of jet fuel at KDAY.  See  Req. for Dismissal (RFD)  at 2.  The solicitation provided for award on a 
lowest -price, technically acceptable basis.  See  Supp. RFD  at 3.  On February 4, 2025, 
the agency notified the protester that award had been made to Premier.  Supp. RFD,

reflected that only two offerors --Wright Brothers and Premier --had submitted proposals .  
Id. at 1-2.  The notice also advised the agency’s evaluation determined that “ Wright  Page 2 B-423326.2  Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for all line

made to Premier as the lowest -priced , technically acceptable offeror .  Protest, exh. 5, 
Debriefing, B-423326, Feb. 11, 2025.  
 
Wright Brothers filed a protest with our Office on February 11, challenging the agency’s 
evaluation and award decision.  Wright Bros. Aero, Inc., B -423326, Mar. 5, 2025 
(unpublished decision).  In response, the agency advised our office that it intended to take corrective action by reevaluating proposals , reopening  discussions if necessary, 
and issuing  a new award decision.  Id.  at 1.  As a result of the agency’s proposed 
corrective action, w e dismissed the protest as academic on March 5.  Id.  at 1-2. 
 On April 15, in response to an inquiry from Wright Brothers  regarding the status of the 
procurement , the contracting officer advised the protester  that the corrective action had 
been “completed and closed” and that the “ KDAY [contract]  has been awarded.”  RFD, 
exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1.  When Wright Brothers asked whether it would “be receiving communication on who has won the award,” the contracting officer responded that “[t]he awardee was the same as the original awardee” and that she was unsure if there would be any additional communication until she could “ get with Legal.”  Id.  
 On April 28, Wright Brothers emailed the contracting officer, requesting an update and asking:  “Is it possible to get a debrief since there should have been a corrective action?”  RFD, exh. 3, April 28- 29 Emails.  The next day, the contracting officer 
responded, “I will forward up to Legal.”  Id.   On May 25, having received no further 
information from the agency, Wright Brothers filed this protest with our Office.  Protest at 1.  The agency then requested that we dismiss the protest as untimely and for fail ing 
to state a valid basis of protest.  RFD at 1-2. 
 DISCUSSION  Wright Brothers’s current protest challenges the agency’s evaluation and award decision, as well as the agency’s implementation of the corrective action in response to the firm’s earlier protest.
1  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to RFD at 2-7.  The agency contends  
the protest is untimely and should be dismissed.  We agree.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or  delaying 
 
1 Wright Brothers’s protest also raises allegations that the agency failed to provide a 
proper notice of the corrective action award and failed to provide a debriefing.  These allegations are not subject to review by our Office inasmuch as the adequacy and conduct of a notice of award or debriefing are procedural matters that do not involve the validity of an award.

improprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis  for protest, whichever is earlier.

that challenges “a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required.”   Id.  In such cases, 
with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the protest must be filed no later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.  Id. 
 Wright Brothers  maintains that it delayed submitting a protest because the firm was 
waiting  (1) for the contracting officer to respond to its emails requesting more details 
about the award,  and (2) a debriefing from the agency .  Resp. to R FD at 1-2.  For the 
reasons discussed below, t hese arguments provide no basis for our Office to consider 
an untimely protest.  
  More Details  
 The protester alleges  that the agency’s April 15 emails did not include the identity of the 
successful offeror, award amount, or explanation of the basis for award, and that it delayed filing the protest because it was waiting for this information to be provided in a “formal notice” so it would have “a definitive basis to protest.”   Protest at  1-2; Resp. to 
RFD at 2 -7.  The record reflects, however, that Wright Brothers’s challenges to the

protester  as of April 15, when the agency explained that it had reaffirmed  its initial

February 4.  Supp. RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice.  In that  February  notice, the 
protester was advised that award had been made to Premier.  Id. at 1.  The notice also 
provided the contract award price, as well as informing the protester  that only two 
offerors had submitted proposals .  Id. at 1-2.  On April 15, through email

[contract] has been awarded, ” and that “[t]he awardee was the same as the original 
awardee. ”  RFD, exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1- 2.  At th at point, through information from 
the February  4 award notice and the April  15 email s, the protester was aware of  (1) the

(“Wright Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for 
all line items solicited ”).  RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice at 1; RFD, exh. 2, April 15

DIGEST  
 Protest that agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee’s proposal is dismissed as 
untimely where the protester filed the protest more than 10 days after the firm knew or should have known the basis of protest.  
DECISION  
 Wright Brothers Aero, Inc., a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, protests the award of a contract to Premier Jet Services DAY, LLC, a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, under solicitation No. SPE607 -24-R- 0200, issued by the Defense Logistics Agency for aircr aft 
refueling at James M . Cox Dayton International Airport  (KDAY)  in Dayton, Ohio.  The 
protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee’s  proposal and 
failed to reasonably and properly implement corrective action in response to a prior protest.  
 We dismiss the protest because it is untimely.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on June 13, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, for 723,060 gallons of jet fuel at KDAY.  See  Req. for Dismissal (RFD)  at 2.  The solicitation provided for award on a 
lowest -price, technically acceptable basis.  See  Supp. RFD  at 3.  On February 4, 2025, 
the agency notified the protester that award had been made to Premier.  Supp. RFD,  
exh. 4, February  Award Notice at 1.  The notice provided the contract award price and 
reflected that only two offerors --Wright Brothers and Premier --had submitted proposals .  
Id. at 1-2.  The notice also advised the agency’s evaluation determined that “ Wright  Page 2 B-423326.2  Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for all line 
items solicited .”  Id. at 1.  The agency subsequently confirmed in a written  debriefing, 
dated February 6,  that both proposals were  technically  acceptable and award had been 
made to Premier as the lowest -priced , technically acceptable offeror .  Protest, exh. 5, 
Debriefing, B-423326, Feb. 11, 2025.  
 
Wright Brothers filed a protest with our Office on February 11, challenging the agency’s 
evaluation and award decision.  Wright Bros. Aero, Inc., B -423326, Mar. 5, 2025 
(unpublished decision).  In response, the agency advised our office that it intended to take corrective action by reevaluating proposals , reopening  discussions if necessary, 
and issuing  a new award decision.  Id.  at 1.  As a result of the agency’s proposed 
corrective action, w e dismissed the protest as academic on March 5.  Id.  at 1-2. 
 On April 15, in response to an inquiry from Wright Brothers  regarding the status of the 
procurement , the contracting officer advised the protester  that the corrective action had 
been “completed and closed” and that the “ KDAY [contract]  has been awarded.”  RFD, 
exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1.  When Wright Brothers asked whether it would “be receiving communication on who has won the award,” the contracting officer responded that “[t]he awardee was the same as the original awardee” and that she was unsure if there would be any additional communication until she could “ get with Legal.”  Id.  
 On April 28, Wright Brothers emailed the contracting officer, requesting an update and asking:  “Is it possible to get a debrief since there should have been a corrective action?”  RFD, exh. 3, April 28- 29 Emails.  The next day, the contracting officer 
responded, “I will forward up to Legal.”  Id.   On May 25, having received no further 
information from the agency, Wright Brothers filed this protest with our Office.  Protest at 1.  The agency then requested that we dismiss the protest as untimely and for fail ing 
to state a valid basis of protest.  RFD at 1-2. 
 DISCUSSION  Wright Brothers’s current protest challenges the agency’s evaluation and award decision, as well as the agency’s implementation of the corrective action in response to the firm’s earlier protest.
1  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to RFD at 2-7.  The agency contends  
the protest is untimely and should be dismissed.  We agree.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or  delaying 
 
1 Wright Brothers’s protest also raises allegations that the agency failed to provide a 
proper notice of the corrective action award and failed to provide a debriefing.  These allegations are not subject to review by our Office inasmuch as the adequacy and conduct of a notice of award or debriefing are procedural matters that do not involve the validity of an award.  See Moura’s Cleaning Serv., Inc. , B-402741.4, Sept. 7, 2010,

2012 CPD ¶ 260 at 4.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged 
improprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis  for protest, whichever is earlier.  
4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).   An exception to this general rule applies with respect to a protest 
that challenges “a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required.”   Id.  In such cases, 
with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the protest must be filed no later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.  Id. 
 Wright Brothers  maintains that it delayed submitting a protest because the firm was 
waiting  (1) for the contracting officer to respond to its emails requesting more details 
about the award,  and (2) a debriefing from the agency .  Resp. to R FD at 1-2.  For the 
reasons discussed below, t hese arguments provide no basis for our Office to consider 
an untimely protest.  
  More Details  
 The protester alleges  that the agency’s April 15 emails did not include the identity of the 
successful offeror, award amount, or explanation of the basis for award, and that it delayed filing the protest because it was waiting for this information to be provided in a “formal notice” so it would have “a definitive basis to protest.”   Protest at  1-2; Resp. to 
RFD at 2 -7.  The record reflects, however, that Wright Brothers’s challenges to the 
agency’s evaluation and award decision are based on information know n to the 
protester  as of April 15, when the agency explained that it had reaffirmed  its initial 
award to Premier.  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to R FD at 2-7.   
 As discussed above, the agency provided Wright Brothers with a notice of award on 
February 4.  Supp. RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice.  In that  February  notice, the 
protester was advised that award had been made to Premier.  Id. at 1.  The notice also 
provided the contract award price, as well as informing the protester  that only two 
offerors had submitted proposals .  Id. at 1-2.  On April 15, through email 
correspondence with the agency , Wright Brothers was advised that the “KDAY 
[contract] has been awarded, ” and that “[t]he awardee was the same as the original 
awardee. ”  RFD, exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1- 2.  At th at point, through information from 
the February  4 award notice and the April  15 email s, the protester was aware of  (1) the 
identity of the successful offeror ; (2) the awarded amount ; and (3) the basis for award 
(“Wright Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for 
all line items solicited ”).  RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice at 1; RFD, exh. 2, April 15 
Emails at 1 -2.  Further, because the Air Force had not requested revised proposals, the 
protester was on notice that  the agency’s reaffirmed award decision was based on the 
same proposals  and, therefore,  the awarded price remained unchanged from the 
February award notice .

Specifically, 4K Global argued that its PLA met the applicable requirements because the FAR provision does not require a “signed PLA,” but only a draft PLA that an awardee would later negotiate with an unspecified labor organization or organizations.  Id.  at 4.  
4K Global also asserted that an inadequate PLA “cannot be a basis to reject” its proposal because the PLA is an obligation for contract performance that 4K Global needed only to acknowledge and accept through its proposal submission.  Id.  In this 
regard, our decision noted that 4K Global’s primary complaint appeared to be that it was 
unreasonable for the agency to include the PLA requirement in the solicitation.  See id.  
at 4-5, citing Comments at 4 (“To impose this requirement [for a signed PLA] upon 4K 
(and/or other Contractors) would be improper because 4K would be expected to enter into a PLA prior to being awarded a project contrary to the express requirement of the Solicitation.”).  
 On January 15, our Office denied 4K Global’s protest.  In denying the protest, we noted that the referenced FAR clause defines a PLA as “a pre- hire collective bargaining 
agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project,” entered into “prior to the 
award” and mai ntained “throughout the life of the contract.”  FAR 52.222- 34(a), (b).   
We also noted that the FAR provision obligates offerors to “[n]egotiate or become a 
party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations” and includes a 
subsection that specifies six requirements for any PLA, including that it “[b]ind the Offeror and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply.”  FAR 52.222- 33(b), (c).   
 Based on these FAR sections, we concluded that the agency reasonably rejected 4K Global’s proposal based on the submission of a PLA that “neither evidenced that 4K Global had negotiated or become a party to an agreement with any labor organization, nor identified any subcontractors who have agreed to be bound to comply with the PLA.”  Id.  at 4.  As relevant here, we also dismissed as untimely 4K Global’s argument 
that the solicitation’s PLA requirements were unreasonable, finding that the argument constitut ed an allegation of solicitation improprieties that was required to be raised prior 
to the proposal due date.  Id. at 5, citing ASRC Fed. Data Sols. , LLC, B-417655 et al.,

 In seeking reconsideration, 4K Global asserts that our prior decision “contains an error of law” because a COFC decision, MVL USA, Inc., et al. v. United States, 174 Fed. Cl. 437 (2025), issued on January  21, “struck down the mandate of President Biden’s 
Executive Order 14063 regarding the [PLA] requirement.”  Req. for Recon. at  1-2.  Our  Page 3 B-423092.2  Bid Protest Regulations provide that to obtain reconsideration, the requesting party 
must set forth the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification of the decision is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not previously considered.  4 C.F.R. §  21.14(a) .  Our Regulations further provide that we 
will summarily dismiss any request for reconsideration that fails to state a valid basis for reconsideration.  Id . § 21.14(c) .  For  the reasons that follow, 4K Global has  not provided 
a valid basis for reconsideration.  
 As an initial matter, 4K Global’s reliance on the COFC’s MVL USA decision as the sole 
basis for its request for reconsideration is misplaced.  As our Office has previously explained, while we have traditionally given careful consideration to decisions of the court, we are not bound by them.  See, e.g., Kingdomware Techs. --Recon., B-407232.2, 
Dec. 13, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  351 at  3.  We note further that 4K Global’s request for 
reconsideration does not elaborate on the nature of the “error of law” alleged in our prior decision or how the holding in MVL USA applies to the fact s and issues presented in 4K 
Global’s protest.  Instead, it simply states that, “[i]n light of the MVL USA, Inc.  opinion 
striking down President Biden’s Executive Order  14063, Project Labor Agreement 
Mandate, the GAO’s decision contains an error of law.”  See Req. for Recon. at  2. 
 Moreover, we disagree with 4K Global’s assertion that the court’s holding in MVL USA is relevant or applicable to the matter at hand in 4K Global’s protest.   First, we note 
fundamental differences in the procedural posture in the COFC case.  Specifically, the pre-award protests filed in the MVL USA decision challenged the propriety of including 
the PLA requirement in different solicitations for different procurements.
1  See generally, 
MVL USA, Inc., et al.,  supra.  The court, considering the timeliness of one of the 
protests under the Federal Circuit’s Blue & Gold standard, concluded that the protest was timely filed because it challenged the terms of the solicitation “prior to the close of 
the bidding process.”  See id. at  471-473 ( citing Blue & Gold Fleet, L. P. v. United 
States, 492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2007 )).     
 
By contrast, 4K Global’s protest was filed after award.  Indeed, our decision specifically 
noted that “the protester’s true argument appears not to be that the draft PLA it submitted met the solicitation’s requirements, but that the solicitation should not have 
required a specific, definite PLA.”  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra at  4.  Because our 
timeliness rules require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation 
that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial submiss ions be filed 
before that time, see 4 C.F.R.  § 21.2(a)(1), we found that 4K Global’s challenges to the 
solicitation’s PLA requirements were untimely.  Id. at 5.  Given the procedural 
differences with the protests, 4K Global’s reliance on the holding in the pre- award, MVL 
 
1 To the extent the court’s holding, as the protester argues, “struck down the mandate of

requirement in solicitations without first considering its effect on full and open competition required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA).  See MVL USA, Inc., et al., supra 
at 448-452.    Page 4 B-423092.2  USA decision to allege an error with our dismissal of 4K Global’s post -award challenge

 In any event, even if we were to accept that the MVL USA court’s interpretation of the PLA requirements had any bearing on our Office’s review of a protest challenging an agency’s PLA evaluation, nothing in the court’s decision indicates that its interpretation would apply to the award here.  Specifically, the MVL court limited its holding to “the 
functionality of the mandate as applied to the individual contracts in this case” and “the FAR requirements [for PLAs] in the solicitations . . . as applied to th e contracts at issue 
here.”  MVL USA, Inc., et al.,  supra  at 441, 463.  Therefore, the court’s holding, by its

DIGEST  
 Request for reconsideration is dismissed where the request, which is based on a holding in a U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision issued after our Office’s bid protest decision, does not show that the protest decision contains errors of fact or law that would warrant reversal or modification of the decision.  
DECISION  
 4K Global -ACC JV, LLC (4K Global), a small business of Augusta, Georgia, requests 
reconsideration of our decision in 4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, B -423092, Jan.  15, 2025, 
2025 CPD ¶  31, in which we denied the firm’s protest of the award of a contract to 
Roundhouse PBN -Tepa EC 2 JV, a small business of Warner Robins, Georgia, under 
request for proposals  No. W912HN24R3006 (RFP).  The RFP was  issued by the 
Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers (Corps) for building repairs.   4K Global 
contends, based on its interpretation of the holding in a United States Court of Federal Claims (COFC) decision issued after the issuance of our protest decision, that our decision contains an error of law.  
 
We dismiss the request for reconsideration.  
 
On September 28, 2024, the Corps notified 4K Global that its proposal was not selected for award under the RFP because the firm’s project labor agreement (PLA) “did not comply” with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra at 2.  In this regard, the solicitation required offerors to 
submit a PLA “in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 33 and FAR clause 52.222- 34.”  
Id.  The Corps found that 4K Global’s PLA did “not meet the minimum requirements” 
identified  in FAR provision  52.222- 33(c) and was therefore ineligible for award.  Id.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423092.2  Specifically, the agency found that the PLA “did not meet the basic definition for such an 
agreement” because it was labeled as an agreement between 4K Global and the Corps, was “not signed by anyone other than the Offeror and ma[de]  no representation that any 
party --let alone a labor organization--has entered into the agreement or is bound by it.”   
Id. at 3 (quoting AR, Tab  5, Source Selection Decision Document at  10).  
 In its protest, 4K Global challenged the agency’s determination that the firm’s PLA did not meet the applicable FAR requirements.  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra.  
Specifically, 4K Global argued that its PLA met the applicable requirements because the FAR provision does not require a “signed PLA,” but only a draft PLA that an awardee would later negotiate with an unspecified labor organization or organizations.  Id.  at 4.  
4K Global also asserted that an inadequate PLA “cannot be a basis to reject” its proposal because the PLA is an obligation for contract performance that 4K Global needed only to acknowledge and accept through its proposal submission.  Id.  In this 
regard, our decision noted that 4K Global’s primary complaint appeared to be that it was 
unreasonable for the agency to include the PLA requirement in the solicitation.  See id.  
at 4-5, citing Comments at 4 (“To impose this requirement [for a signed PLA] upon 4K

The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423341 et al.  Chase, Maryland, under fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR) No. FA8773- 24-R-
0002, issued by the Department of the Air Force for intranet control support services to 
operate, manage, and defend the Air Force’s portion of the Department of Defense information network.  The protester argues that various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of the offerors’ price proposals was unreasonable, the agency engaged in 
misleading discussions with SMS, and the best -value decision is flawed.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on May 21, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, set aside for small business holders of the Department of the Army’s responsive strategic sourcing for services multiple- award 
indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Contracting Officer’s Statement 
(COS) at 3.  SMS was the incumbent contractor and previously performed the same services sought by this procurement.  The FOPR contemplated issuance of a fixed- price 
task order with a period of performance to include a 2- month transition period, a 10-
month base period, four 12- month option periods, and a 6- month option to extend.  
Agency Report (AR), Tab 35, Instruction to Offerors (ITO) Amend. 1 at 9.   
 The FOPR stated that proposals would be evaluated under the following factors:  technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  at 15.  The technical factor would be rated 
as either acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Past performance was to be assessed and 
assigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, 
limited or no confidence.  Id. at 18.  Regarding price, the FOPR stated that total 
evaluated price would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced pricing.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR required that offerors submit 
professional employee compensation plans and stated they would be evaluated in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional 
Employees.  Id. at 20.   
 The FOPR further stated:   
 
Proposals must be technically acceptable to be awardable.  Past performance is considered more important than Price, and the 
Government may choose to trade past performance for price on 
technically acceptable proposals. . . .  All offerors judged to have a 
“Substantial Confidence” past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision 
Authority shall make an integrated assess ment award decision to the 
offeror deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  
 
Id. at 14.  
  Page 3 B-423341 et al.  The agency received nine proposals in response to the solicitation, including from SMS 
and Abacus.  COS at 4.  Following the initial evaluation of proposals, the agency elected to engage in technical interchanges with five offerors and subsequently engaged in interchanges with four of those offerors regarding their professional 
employee compensation plans.  Id.  at 10.  In its final evaluation of proposals, the 
agency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were acceptable under the technical factor and assigned both offerors ratings of substantial confidence under the past 
performance factor.  AR, Tab 120, Fair Opportunity Decision Document (FODD) at 22.  The agency also concluded that both offerors submitted realistic professional employee compensation plans; SM S’s final proposed price was $128,545,851, and Abacus’s final 
proposed price was $116,202,405.  Id.   
 On February 11, 2025, the contracting officer, who also served as the source selection authority (SSA), awarded the task order to Abacus and provided SMS with a combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  On February 21, SMS filed its protest.

DISCUSSION 
 
The gravamen of the protest is that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate Abacus’s 
lower price as presenting a risk to successful contract performance.  The protester also 
argues that because the agency’s discussions led  SMS to increase its price, the award 
to Abacus at a lower price demonstrates  that the agency’s discussions with SMS were 
misleading.   We address these arguments below.  
 
Timeliness  
 
As an initial matter, the intervenor repeatedly argues that the protest should be 
dismissed in its entirety as premature.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 3- 6; Intervenor 
Reply in Support of Req. for Dismissal at 1- 3; Intervenor Comments at 2, 4- 6.  Abacus 
argues that the protest was prematurely filed prior to the conclusion of SMS’s 
“enhanced debriefing” because SMS was awaiting answers to questions submitted to the agency after it received its combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 5.  The agency concurs with the 
intervenor’s request.  Agency Concurrence with Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 1.  
 As noted, the procurement here was conducted using FAR subpart 16.5 procedures, 
which state that “[t]he procedures at [FAR] 15.506 shall be followed when providing 
[post award] debriefing to unsuccessful awardees.”  FAR 16.505(b)(6)(ii).  Section 
15.506 st ates:  “ An offeror, upon its written request received by the agency within 3 
days after the date on which that offeror has received notification of contract award . . . 
 
1 The awarded value of the task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this 
procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders 
under multiple- award IDIQ contracts awarded under the authority of title 10 of the 
United  States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).   Page 4 B-423341 et al.  shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract 
award.”  However, the agency did not wait for the protester to request a debriefing as contemplated by FAR section 15.506 and instead provided the protester a written debriefing along with its unsuccessful offeror notice.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  
 In the unsuccessful offeror notice, the agency stated that “in accordance with [Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)] 215.506- 70 the Government 
provides each offeror the opportunity to submit additional written questions . . . in writing, no later than Friday, 14 February 2025.”  Id. at 2.  In this regard, DFARS section 
215.506- 70(a) provides procedures for an “enhanced debriefing” and states that 
contracting officers shall “[p]rovide an opportunity to submit additional questions related to the required debriefing not later than 2 business days after receiving the [post -award] 
debriefing.”  This same regulation also states that a post -award debriefing is not 
considered to be concluded until the later of “(1) the date that the [post -award] 
debriefing is delivered, orally or in writing; or (2) if additional written questions related to 
the debriefing are timely received, the date the agency delivers its written response.”  DFARS 215.506- 70(c).  Since the debriefing was provided to SMS on February 11, the 
due date for submission of additional questions as required by DFARS section 215.506-70 was February 13, not February 14 as stated in the unsuccessful offeror notice.  The protest explained:  
 
In SMS’s Unsuccessful Offeror Notice, the Contracting Officer stated that “in accordance with DFARS 215.506- 70 the Government provides each 
offeror the opportunity to submit additional written questions as part of 
an enhanced debriefing.” []  The Contracting Officer requested the 
questions by February 14, 2025, and SMS submitted questions on this date.  However, February 14, 2025, is three days after SMS received its 
[post award]  debriefing on February 11, 2025, and DFARS 215.506-
70(a) requires written quest ions to be submitted “not later than 2 
business days after receiving the [ post award]  debriefing.”  Therefore, 
while SMS did submit written questions for debriefing, in an abundance of caution regarding GAO’s protest deadlines, SMS is filing the current protest.  
 Protest at 2 n.2.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests. These timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly dis rupting or 
delaying the procurement process.  Beckman Coulter, Inc. , B-421748, July 28, 2023, 
2023 CPD ¶ 180 at 3.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).  
  Page 5 B-423341 et al.  An exception to our general timeliness rule is a protest that challenges “a procurement 
conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required,” where a protest would be considered timely if f iled 
within 10 days after the debriefing.  Id.  This exception to our timeliness rules  does not 
apply where an agency provides a debriefing that is not required.  Exceptional Software 
Strategies, Inc. , B-416232, July 12, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 237 at 5.  Consequently, where 
a debriefing is not legally required, a protester that delays the filing of a protest until after that debriefing may be untimely as to any grounds of protest it knew or should have known more than 10 days before filing the protest.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1) -(2); Done 
By Native, LLC , B-422270, Mar. 29, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 87 at 3.  
 In order to extend its debriefing, section 215.506- 70(a) of the DFARS required the 
protester to submit questions to the agency no later than two business days after receiving its written debriefing on February 11.  The protester submitted its questions on February 14, one day later than the deadline set by the regulation.  Therefore, because SMS did not timely submit its questions pursuant to DFARS section 215.506- 70(a), the 
debriefing was considered to be concluded on the date the debriefing was delivered,  
i.e., February 11.  Under these circumstances, the protest was required to be filed within 
10 days of when the protester knew or should have known its basis of protest and SMS could not wait to file the protest until the agency provided answers to its untimely  
submitted questions.  Accordingly, we conclude that the protest was not premature and was timely filed.

 Price Evaluation  
 
The protester argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus’s proposal 
under FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional 
Employees .  According to SMS, it proposed rates largely in line with its incumbent rates, 
and the agency failed to recognize that Abacus’s lower total price--10 percent less than the total price proposed by SMS --is clearly unrealistic.  The protester argues that 
 
2 The intervenor also raised several other arguments for dismissal, including SMS’s 
allegation that the agency should have found Abacus unacceptable under the management/staffing plan subfactor because Abacus’s proposed price was lower than the price propos ed by SMS.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 8.  By itself, the fact that 
Abacus proposed a lower price fails to demonstrate that Abacus’s proposal could not have included an acceptable response to the information required by the solicitation.  Indeed, the FOPR did not require that the agency consider Abacus’s proposed price 
under the management/staffing plan subfactor, and the protester provided no other support for its argument that Abacus should have been found unacceptable.  S ee 
Protest at 14- 15.  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency action 
(e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.  Eagle 
Hill Consulting, LLC, B -421938.2, B -421938.3, Dec. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 288 at 4.  
Accordingly, we dismissed this protest allegation and did not require the agency to address it in its report.  Electronic Protest Docketing System No.  25; 4 C.F.R. § 21.5(f).  
We denied the intervenor’s requests to di smiss SMS’s other protest grounds.   Page 6 B-423341 et al.  Abacus will not be able to retain the professional employees required for successful 
contract performance, and the agency should have rejected its proposal.  Protest at  10-
13.  The agency argues that its evaluation was fair, reasonable, and consistent with the 
terms of the FOPR and FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  10-

 The purpose of a review of compensation for professional employees is to evaluate each offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering the realism 
of the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruiting and retention.  ENGlobal Gov’t Servs., Inc., B -419612.3, Dec. 15, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 12 at 11.  FAR 
provision 52.222- 46 requires a two- prong evaluation of professional employee 
compensation plans.  The first prong is, in effect, a price realism evaluation of proposed compensation, to determine whether an offeror understands the contract requirements and has proposed a compensation plan appropriate for those requirements.  IBSS Corp. , B-422757 et al. , Oct. 24, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 258 at 8.  The second prong 
requires an agency to determine whether a proposal “envision[s] compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors” by comparing proposed compensation rates to those of the incumbent.  Guidehouse LLP; Jacobs Tech. Inc. , B-420860 et al. , 
Oct. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 257 at 7.   
 The comparison of an offeror’s proposed professional employee compensation to that of the incumbent contractor is a separate inquiry from the realism of the proposed plan and its impact on recruiting and retention.  The Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, July 13, 
2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 259 at 5.  If the agency determines that the awardee’s proposal envisions lower compensation levels compared to the incumbent contractor, then the 
agency must further evaluate the awardee’s proposed compensation plan on the basis of maintaining program continuity, among other considerations.  FAR provision 52.222-46(b); OBXtek, Inc., B -422057, B -422057.2, Jan 2, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 18 at 6.  
 Here, the FOPR required that offerors submit “a total compensation plan setting forth base rate hourly salary and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract,” to include a professional compensation matrix and a professional compensation plan narrative.  ITO Amend. 1 at 10- 12.  The FOPR also 
required that offerors submit a pricing labor matrix, a template of which was provided with the FOPR as an attachment.  Id.  at 12.  The FOPR stated that the offeror’s price 
proposal would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced 
pricing based upon the total evaluated price proposed.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR 
stated:  “The Professional Employee Compensation Plan will be evaluated for realism and is separate from the [total evaluated price] evaluation.”  Id.   
 With respect to the evaluation of the professional employee compensation plans, the FOPR provided:  
 
The Government will compare proposed rates to incumbent rates if available.  If necessary (for example, where comparison to incumbent rates is not feasible), the Government may validate the offeror’s  Page 7 B-423341 et al.  supporting data and use a variety of resources and methods to evaluate 
the realism of the offeror’s Professional Compensation Plan.  This includes, but is not limited to:  comparing prices paid on prior or similar contracts, comparison of proposed pricing from multiple offerors, market data from one or multiple sources (e.g., Watson & Wyatt, Economic Research Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Salary.com, etc.), or a combination of the above.  
Id. at 20.  The FOPR further noted that for proposed compensation that was lower than 
the incumbent prices, the agency would evaluate the proposed compensation on the basis of “maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality work, and 
availability of required competent professional service employees.”  Id.  
 The record shows that the agency reviewed Abacus’s professional employee compensation plan and concluded:  “Abacus’s proposed fringe benefits were considered when evaluating total compensation, and the Government determined they proposed sufficient fringe benefits for recruitment and retention when compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.”  AR, Tab 112, Abacus Evaluation at 25.   The record further shows that the agency computed average 
compensation rates across all offerors by labor category and used this data along with market data from Economic Research Institute (ERI) and Salary.com to assess the labor category rates proposed by each offeror.  Id.   The agency also compared 
proposed rates to incumbent rates, and explained its evaluation, in pertinent part, as follows:  
 
The Government noted any incumbent rates that were significantly lower (more than 4 [percent] ) than market data and the competition average to 
assess the reliability of the incumbent rate for recruitment of new employees and retention of current employees.  The 4 [percent]  measure 
was judgmentally determined by the Government considering the current employer cost index of 4.1 [percent] , meaning that a difference of more 
than 4 [percent]  is not readily explained by fluctuations in the labor 
market.  For thos e labor categories where the incumbent was significantly 
lower than market and competition, the Government determined it would evaluate proposed rates further against the market and competition data, [in accordance with]  the FOPR and FAR 52.222- 46, to consider the 
impact of the proposed rate on recruiting and retention, whether the rate is realistic, and to determine the offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted high- quality work.  . . .  Where the Government found the incumbent rate 
to be reliable, and the offeror’s proposed rate was above the incumbent 
compensation levels, the proposed rate was determined to be realistic.  
 
* * * * * 
 In many cases the incumbent evaluation rate was well above (between 4 [percent]  and 42 [percent] ) market and competition.  Where the proposed 
rate was below the incumbent rate (envisioning compensation levels  Page 8 B-423341 et al.  lower than the incumbent), the Government evaluated the proposed rate 
“on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality 
work, and availability of required competent professional service employees ” by comparing to the competition average, Salary.com market 
data, and ERI market data.  Proposed rates higher than 4 [percent]  below 
any of these data points were determined to be realistic.  
 For rates where the incumbent rate was potentially unreliable as described above or where no incumbent rate was available, the Government further evaluated against both market data points and the competitive average.  The Government determined a rate to be 
unrealistic if it was 4  [percent]  or more below all data points, including the 
competitive average, Salary.com market data, ERI market data, and the incumbent rate (if available and reliable).  
 Id. at 26- 27.   
 The record shows that two- thirds of Abacus’s proposed rates were higher than the 
incumbent rates; the one- third of Abacus’s rates that fell below the incumbent rates 
were otherwise higher than at least one of the rates used by the agency for comparison (i.e., average competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  Id. at 28- 29.  The agency 
concluded that the price proposal submitted by Abacus was complete, reasonable, and balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  Id.  at 30.   
 In contrast, in its evaluation of SMS, the agency identified six labor category rates that 
were more than four percent below the rates used for comparison; in other words, SMS 
proposed rates below the incumbent rate, or where an incumbent rate was unavailable 
or unreliable, SMS proposed rates more than four percent below the average competition rate, ERI, and Salary.com.  The record does not support the protester’s argument that Abacus’s proposal should have been rejected because of its much lower price.  O n the contrary, the record shows that Abacus’s proposed labor rates were all 
higher than either the incumbent rates or the other data used by the agency ( i.e., 
average competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s conclusion that Abacus’s professional employee compensation plan was realistic and find that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the requirements of FAR provision 52.222- 46.

3 The protester maintains that the agency’s evaluation is flawed because the agency 
compared base hourly salary rates rather than fully burdened rates that would include fringe benefits.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 4- 7.  However, as explained by the 
agency, rather than using fully burdened rates, its evaluation utilized incumbent payroll data because this information provided actual employee salary information.  COS at 11-12.  Our Office has previously found that an agency’s use of burdened labor rates in an evaluation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 did not permit meaningful consideration of 
the compensation to be paid to employees.   See MicroTechnologies, LLC , B-413091,  
(continued...)   Page 9 B-423341 et al.   
The protester also argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus’s price under Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) provision 252.204- 7024 
and would have found Abacus to be unacceptable if it compared Abacus’s rates to historical pri ces paid.  Protest at 13- 14; 2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 7 -8.  SMS 
contends that under this DFARS clause, the agency was required to evaluate the price risk of Abacus’s total proposed price.  
 The DFARS provision 252.204- 7024 defines price risk as “a measure of whether a 
proposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.”  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(a).  The DFARS mandates that the 
suppl ier performance risk system (SPRS) be used in the evaluation of an offeror’s 
performance and requires the contracting officer to “ consider SPRS risk assessments 
during the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows:  . . . (2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is 
consistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. ”  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(c)(2).  
 The agency argues that it properly evaluated Abacus’s price in accordance with this requirement, and consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  MOL at 18- 22.  The 
contracting officer explains that SPRS functionality is currently limited to running a search based on a part number or other identification (such as a national item identification number or national stock number).  The contracting officer states that for 100 percent service contracts that are not associated with a part number or product code, the pr ice risk for that particular service is not available.  COS at 22- 23.  The 
record includes a declaration from the SPRS program manager, in which he confirms:  
 
At present time, if a service contract does not have an associated [Product Service Code (PSC)] or Manufacturer [Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)] Code with a Part Number or [National Item Identification Number (NIIN)], the SPRS Item/Price Risk Repo rt search will not be found 
which is equivalent to yielding a “not available” result, indicating there is no performance risk information in SPRS for that particular PSC/part number combination.  
 AR, Tab 130, Decl. of SPRS Program Manager at 2.   
 
 
B-413091.2, Aug. 11, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 219 at 8- 14.  Further, as noted, the agency 
also separately evaluated Abacus’s proposed fringe benefits and determined they were sufficient for recruitment and retention “when compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.”  AR, Tab 112, Abacus  Evaluation at 25.  We find this 
explanation is reasonable and that the evaluation satisfies the FAR requirement to evaluate each offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering 
the realism of the proposed professional compensati on and its impact upon recruiting 
and retention.   Page 10 B-423341 et al.  On this record, we find the agency’s explanation of how it used the SPRS reasonable 
and consistent with the requirements of DFARS provision 252.204- 7024.  Accordingly, 
this allegation is denied.4 
 After review of the initial agency report, the protester additionally contends that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis.  SMS argues that despite Abacus’s lower price, Abacus proposed labor category rates that were well abov e the incumbent rate, and the record fails to document why these rates were found 
to be reasonable.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 3 -4.  The agency argues that this 
allegation fails to state a valid basis of protest because the FOPR did not require a pri ce 
reasonableness assessment of individual labor category rates, and it properly evaluated total evaluated prices for reasonableness, consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  Supp. COS/MOL at 7 -9. 
 We agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require that the agency assess whether individual labor category rates were too high.  As our decisions have stated, the purpose of a price reasonableness review is to determine whether the prices offered are too high, as opposed to too low.  Tetra Tech, Inc. , B-409095, B -409095.2, Jan. 17, 
2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 108 at 7.  The solicitation clearly stated that total evaluated price would be evaluated for price reasonableness.  ITO Amend. 1 at 14, 19.  There w as 
nothing in the solicitation that provided for the agency to analyze individual labor rates for reasonableness.  Accordingly, we dismiss this argument because it fails to state a valid basis of protest.  Eagle Hill Consulting, LLC , supra.  
 
Misleading Discussions  
 The protester argues that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS because the agency informed SMS that some of its rates were unrealistically low and led SMS to increase its price yet made award to Abacus at a much lower evaluated price.  Pro test at 15.  The agency argues that exchanges were not misleading, and it 
reasonably  identified rates proposed by SMS that were found to be unrealistically low, 
but did not require that SMS increase them.  The agency avers that SMS elected to 
increase its price  rather than justify the rates it initially proposed and that SMS’s 
decision to raise its price fails to demonstrate that  the agency’s exchanges were 
misleading.   MOL at 22- 25. 
 The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not, as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement here.  Engineering Design Techs., Inc. , B-413281, Sept. 21, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 265 at 5.  In this regard, FAR 
 
4 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to determine whether Abacus had a 
score in the SPRS as required by the FOPR and DFARS provision 252.204- 7019 and 
clause 252.204- 7020.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 2- 3.  After review of the 
supplemental agency report, the protester withdrew this allegation.  Supp. Comments at 1.  Page 11 B-423341 et al.  section 16.505 does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order 
competition; nonetheless, when exchanges with the agency occur in task order competitions, they must be fair and not misleading.  CGI Fed. Inc. , B-403570 et al. ,  
Nov. 5, 2010, 2011 CPD ¶ 32 at 9.  In our decisions addressing an agency’s obligations in conducting discussions under FAR part 15, we have stated that an agency may not mislead an offeror through the framing of a discussion question into responding in a manner that does not address the agency’s actual concerns, or otherwise misinform the 
offeror concerning a problem with its proposal.  Refinery Assocs. of Texas, Inc. ,  
B-410911.2, Mar. 18, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 116 at 6.  
 As discussed, the agency identified six labor category rates that it considered to be unrealistic and issued a notice to SMS.
5  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation 
Interchange 003 at 2- 3.  That notice stated:  
 
SMS may choose to revise all or some of the rates at their own discretion or provide adequate justification that the current proposed rates are realistic and meet the criteria in FAR 52.222- 46.  If SMS revises their 
proposal, please utilize an updated complete Professional Compensation Matrix (Attachment 7).  If necessary, the Subcontractors may provide this updated attachment to the Government directly.  The supporting information for the proposed professional compensation information shall be included in the Contractor Response section below.  
 AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.  The record shows that SMS increased its price, and its final proposal was found to be complete, 
reasonable, balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  
AR, Tab 111, SMS Evaluation at 30.   
 The protester argues that blaming SMS for raising its price is not a fair response.  SMS contends that it had no choice but to raise its price and insists that making award at a lower price is evidence the discussions were misleading because it contradicts  the 
information given to SMS during exchanges.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 8- 9.  
However, the protester has not shown that following the price evaluation procedures, as discussed above, the agency’s concerns that the specific rates identified in the notice were incorrect.  And rather than give SMS no choice but to raise its price, the notice 
alternatively afforded SMS the opportunity to provide adequate justification that the initially proposed rates were realistic and met the criteria in FAR provisio n 52.222- 46.  
The protester elected to increase its price rather than provide additional justification to substantiate its initial rates.  Thus, the agency did not mislead the protester during discussions and instead properly identified a concern with the protester’s low rates.  In sum, the record does not support the protester’s contention that the agency misled SMS into increasing its labor rates and price.  Accordingly, we deny this allegation.  
 
 
5 The agency also identified rates proposed by SMS’s subcontractors found to be 
unrealistic.  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.   Page 12 B-423341 et al.  Best-Value Tradeoff  
 
Finally, SMS argues that t he agency  failed to perform and inadequately documented its  
best-value tradeoff .  The protester argues that the agency should have found Abacus’s 
proposal unacceptable, and but for the misleading discussions, SMS would have been 
awarded the contract.   Protest at 16.  The agency argues that the best -value decision is 
reasonable and, consistent with the FOPR, award to SMS at an approximately $12 million price premium cannot be justified.  MOL at 27- 28. 
 As noted, in its final evaluation of proposals, the agency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were technically acceptable with substantial confidence under the past performance factor, and Abacus proposed a lower price.  AR, Tab 120, FODD at 22.  The FOPR stated:  
 
All offerors judged to have a “Substantial Confidence” past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision Authority shall make an integrated assessment award decision to the offeror deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  
 ITO Amend. 1 at 14.  As discussed above, we find no merit to the protester’s challenge to the agency’s evaluation of Abacus’s price proposal or its argument that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS.  Thus, given the solicitation language,  we 
find no basis to conclude that the agency’s determination that Abacus presented the 
best value to the government is unreasonable.  
 The protest is denied.

 1.  Protest is not premature where the protester did not timely submit questions to the agency and therefore the debriefing was considered to be concluded on the date it was 
delivered, and the protest wa s filed within 10 days of that date. 
 2.  Protest of the agency ’s evaluation of the awardee’s  price and professional employee 
compensation plan is denied where the agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with Federal Acquisition Regulation provision 52.222- 46 and the terms of the 
solicitation.  
 3.  Protest that the agency engaged in misleading discussions is denied where the record shows the protester exercised its business judgment and increased its price rather than provide additional information to justify labor rates identified by the agency as unrealistic during exchanges with offerors.

decision is reasonable, consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and adequately documented.  
DECISION  
 SMS Data Products Group, Inc., a small business of McLean, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task order to Abacus Technology Corporation, a small business of Chevy DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been 
approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-423341 et al.  Chase, Maryland, under fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR) No. FA8773- 24-R-
0002, issued by the Department of the Air Force for intranet control support services to 
operate, manage, and defend the Air Force’s portion of the Department of Defense information network.  The protester argues that various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of the offerors’ price proposals was unreasonable, the agency engaged in 
misleading discussions with SMS, and the best -value decision is flawed.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on May 21, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, set aside for small business holders of the Department of the Army’s responsive strategic sourcing for services multiple- award 
indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Contracting Officer’s Statement 
(COS) at 3.  SMS was the incumbent contractor and previously performed the same services sought by this procurement.  The FOPR contemplated issuance of a fixed- price 
task order with a period of performance to include a 2- month transition period, a 10-
month base period, four 12- month option periods, and a 6- month option to extend.  
Agency Report (AR), Tab 35, Instruction to Offerors (ITO) Amend. 1 at 9.   
 The FOPR stated that proposals would be evaluated under the following factors:  technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  at 15.  The technical factor would be rated 
as either acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Past performance was to be assessed and 
assigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, 
limited or no confidence.  Id. at 18.  Regarding price, the FOPR stated that total 
evaluated price would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced pricing.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR required that offerors submit 
professional employee compensation plans and stated they would be evaluated in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional 
Employees.  Id. at 20.   
 The FOPR further stated:   
 
Proposals must be technically acceptable to be awardable.  Past performance is considered more important than Price, and the 
Government may choose to trade past performance for price on 
technically acceptable proposals. . . .  All offerors judged to have a 
“Substantial Confidence” past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision 
Authority shall make an integrated assess ment award decision to the 
offeror deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  
 
Id. at 14.  
  Page 3 B-423341 et al.  The agency received nine proposals in response to the solicitation, including from SMS 
and Abacus.  COS at 4.  Following the initial evaluation of proposals, the agency elected to engage in technical interchanges with five offerors and subsequently engaged in interchanges with four of those offerors regarding their professional 
employee compensation plans.  Id.  at 10.  In its final evaluation of proposals, the 
agency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were acceptable under the technical factor and assigned both offerors ratings of substantial confidence under the past 
performance factor.  AR, Tab 120, Fair Opportunity Decision Document (FODD) at 22.  The agency also concluded that both offerors submitted realistic professional employee compensation plans; SM S’s final proposed price was $128,545,851, and Abacus’s final 
proposed price was $116,202,405.  Id.   
 On February 11, 2025, the contracting officer, who also served as the source selection authority (SSA), awarded the task order to Abacus and provided SMS with a combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  On February 21, SMS filed its protest.

DISCUSSION 
 
The gravamen of the protest is that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate Abacus’s 
lower price as presenting a risk to successful contract performance.  The protester also 
argues that because the agency’s discussions led  SMS to increase its price, the award 
to Abacus at a lower price demonstrates  that the agency’s discussions with SMS were 
misleading.   We address these arguments below.  
 
Timeliness  
 
As an initial matter, the intervenor repeatedly argues that the protest should be 
dismissed in its entirety as premature.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 3- 6; Intervenor 
Reply in Support of Req. for Dismissal at 1- 3; Intervenor Comments at 2, 4- 6.  Abacus 
argues that the protest was prematurely filed prior to the conclusion of SMS’s 
“enhanced debriefing” because SMS was awaiting answers to questions submitted to the agency after it received its combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 5.  The agency concurs with the 
intervenor’s request.  Agency Concurrence with Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 1.  
 As noted, the procurement here was conducted using FAR subpart 16.5 procedures, 
which state that “[t]he procedures at [FAR] 15.506 shall be followed when providing 
[post award] debriefing to unsuccessful awardees.”  FAR 16.505(b)(6)(ii).  Section 
15.506 st ates:  “ An offeror, upon its written request received by the agency within 3 
days after the date on which that offeror has received notification of contract award . . . 
 
1 The awarded value of the task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this 
procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders 
under multiple- award IDIQ contracts awarded under the authority of title 10 of the 
United  States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B).   Page 4 B-423341 et al.  shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract 
award.”  However, the agency did not wait for the protester to request a debriefing as contemplated by FAR section 15.506 and instead provided the protester a written debriefing along with its unsuccessful offeror notice.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  
 In the unsuccessful offeror notice, the agency stated that “in accordance with [Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)] 215.506- 70 the Government 
provides each offeror the opportunity to submit additional written questions . . . in writing, no later than Friday, 14 February 2025.”  Id. at 2.  In this regard, DFARS section 
215.506- 70(a) provides procedures for an “enhanced debriefing” and states that 
contracting officers shall “[p]rovide an opportunity to submit additional questions related to the required debriefing not later than 2 business days after receiving the [post -award] 
debriefing.”  This same regulation also states that a post -award debriefing is not 
considered to be concluded until the later of “(1) the date that the [post -award] 
debriefing is delivered, orally or in writing; or (2) if additional written questions related to 
the debriefing are timely received, the date the agency delivers its written response.”  DFARS 215.506- 70(c).  Since the debriefing was provided to SMS on February 11, the 
due date for submission of additional questions as required by DFARS section 215.506-70 was February 13, not February 14 as stated in the unsuccessful offeror notice.  The protest explained:  
 
In SMS’s Unsuccessful Offeror Notice, the Contracting Officer stated that “in accordance with DFARS 215.506- 70 the Government provides each 
offeror the opportunity to submit additional written questions as part of 
an enhanced debriefing.” []  The Contracting Officer requested the 
questions by February 14, 2025, and SMS submitted questions on this date.  However, February 14, 2025, is three days after SMS received its 
[post award]  debriefing on February 11, 2025, and DFARS 215.506-
70(a) requires written quest ions to be submitted “not later than 2 
business days after receiving the [ post award]  debriefing.”  Therefore, 
while SMS did submit written questions for debriefing, in an abundance of caution regarding GAO’s protest deadlines, SMS is filing the current protest.  
 Protest at 2 n.2.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests. These timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly dis rupting or 
delaying the procurement process.  Beckman Coulter, Inc. , B-421748, July 28, 2023, 
2023 CPD ¶ 180 at 3.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(2).  
  Page 5 B-423341 et al.  An exception to our general timeliness rule is a protest that challenges “a procurement 
conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required,” where a protest would be considered timely if f iled 
within 10 days after the debriefing.  Id.  This exception to our timeliness rules  does not 
apply where an agency provides a debriefing that is not required.  Exceptional Software 
Strategies, Inc. , B-416232, July 12, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 237 at 5.  Consequently, where 
a debriefing is not legally required, a protester that delays the filing of a protest until after that debriefing may be untimely as to any grounds of protest it knew or should have known more than 10 days before filing the protest.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1) -(2); Done 
By Native, LLC , B-422270, Mar. 29, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 87 at 3.  
 In order to extend its debriefing, section 215.506- 70(a) of the DFARS required the 
protester to submit questions to the agency no later than two business days after receiving its written debriefing on February 11.  The protester submitted its questions on February 14, one day later than the deadline set by the regulation.  Therefore, because SMS did not timely submit its questions pursuant to DFARS section 215.506- 70(a), the 
debriefing was considered to be concluded on the date the debriefing was delivered,  
i.e., February 11.  Under these circumstances, the protest was required to be filed within 
10 days of when the protester knew or should have known its basis of protest and SMS could not wait to file the protest until the agency provided answers to its untimely  
submitted questions.  Accordingly, we conclude that the protest was not premature and was timely filed.

 Price Evaluation  
 
The protester argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus’s proposal 
under FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional 
Employees .  According to SMS, it proposed rates largely in line with its incumbent rates, 
and the agency failed to recognize that Abacus’s lower total price--10 percent less than the total price proposed by SMS --is clearly unrealistic.  The protester argues that 
 
2 The intervenor also raised several other arguments for dismissal, including SMS’s 
allegation that the agency should have found Abacus unacceptable under the management/staffing plan subfactor because Abacus’s proposed price was lower than the price propos ed by SMS.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 8.  By itself, the fact that 
Abacus proposed a lower price fails to demonstrate that Abacus’s proposal could not have included an acceptable response to the information required by the solicitation.  Indeed, the FOPR did not require that the agency consider Abacus’s proposed price 
under the management/staffing plan subfactor, and the protester provided no other support for its argument that Abacus should have been found unacceptable.  S ee 
Protest at 14- 15.  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency action 
(e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.  Eagle 
Hill Consulting, LLC, B -421938.2, B -421938.3, Dec. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 288 at 4.  
Accordingly, we dismissed this protest allegation and did not require the agency to address it in its report.  Electronic Protest Docketing System No.  25; 4 C.F.R. § 21.5(f).  
We denied the intervenor’s requests to di smiss SMS’s other protest grounds.   Page 6 B-423341 et al.  Abacus will not be able to retain the professional employees required for successful 
contract performance, and the agency should have rejected its proposal.  Protest at  10-

terms of the FOPR and FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  10-

 The purpose of a review of compensation for professional employees is to evaluate each offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering the realism 
of the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruiting and retention.  ENGlobal Gov’t Servs., Inc., B -419612.3, Dec. 15, 2021, 2022 CPD ¶ 12 at 11.  FAR 
provision 52.222- 46 requires a two- prong evaluation of professional employee 
compensation plans.  The first prong is, in effect, a price realism evaluation of proposed compensation, to determine whether an offeror understands the contract requirements and has proposed a compensation plan appropriate for those requirements.  IBSS Corp. , B-422757 et al. , Oct. 24, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 258 at 8.  The second prong 
requires an agency to determine whether a proposal “envision[s] compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors” by comparing proposed compensation rates to those of the incumbent.  Guidehouse LLP; Jacobs Tech. Inc. , B-420860 et al. , 
Oct. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD ¶ 257 at 7.   
 The comparison of an offeror’s proposed professional employee compensation to that of the incumbent contractor is a separate inquiry from the realism of the proposed plan and its impact on recruiting and retention.  The Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, July 13, 
2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 259 at 5.  If the agency determines that the awardee’s proposal envisions lower compensation levels compared to the incumbent contractor, then the 
agency must further evaluate the awardee’s proposed compensation plan on the basis of maintaining program continuity, among other considerations.  FAR provision 52.222-46(b); OBXtek, Inc., B -422057, B -422057.2, Jan 2, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 18 at 6.  
 Here, the FOPR required that offerors submit “a total compensation plan setting forth base rate hourly salary and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract,” to include a professional compensation matrix and a professional compensation plan narrative.  ITO Amend. 1 at 10- 12.  The FOPR also 
required that offerors submit a pricing labor matrix, a template of which was provided with the FOPR as an attachment.  Id.  at 12.  The FOPR stated that the offeror’s price 
proposal would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced 
pricing based upon the total evaluated price proposed.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR 
stated:  “The Professional Employee Compensation Plan will be evaluated for realism and is separate from the [total evaluated price] evaluation.”  Id.   
 With respect to the evaluation of the professional employee compensation plans, the FOPR provided:  
 
The Government will compare proposed rates to incumbent rates if available.  If necessary (for example, where comparison to incumbent rates is not feasible), the Government may validate the offeror’s  Page 7 B-423341 et al.  supporting data and use a variety of resources and methods to evaluate 
the realism of the offeror’s Professional Compensation Plan.  This includes, but is not limited to:  comparing prices paid on prior or similar contracts, comparison of proposed pricing from multiple offerors, market data from one or multiple sources (e.g., Watson & Wyatt, Economic Research Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Salary.com, etc.), or a combination of the above.  
Id. at 20.  The FOPR further noted that for proposed compensation that was lower than 
the incumbent prices, the agency would evaluate the proposed compensation on the basis of “maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality work, and 
availability of required competent professional service employees.”  Id.  
 The record shows that the agency reviewed Abacus’s professional employee compensation plan and concluded:  “Abacus’s proposed fringe benefits were considered when evaluating total compensation, and the Government determined they proposed sufficient fringe benefits for recruitment and retention when compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.”  AR, Tab 112, Abacus Evaluation at 25.   The record further shows that the agency computed average 
compensation rates across all offerors by labor category and used this data along with market data from Economic Research Institute (ERI) and Salary.com to assess the labor category rates proposed by each offeror.  Id.   The agency also compared 
proposed rates to incumbent rates, and explained its evaluation, in pertinent part, as follows:  
 
The Government noted any incumbent rates that were significantly lower (more than 4 [percent] ) than market data and the competition average to 
assess the reliability of the incumbent rate for recruitment of new employees and retention of current employees.  The 4 [percent]  measure 
was judgmentally determined by the Government considering the current employer cost index of 4.1 [percent] , meaning that a difference of more 
than 4 [percent]  is not readily explained by fluctuations in the labor 
market.  For thos e labor categories where the incumbent was significantly 
lower than market and competition, the Government determined it would evaluate proposed rates further against the market and competition data, [in accordance with]  the FOPR and FAR 52.222- 46, to consider the 
impact of the proposed rate on recruiting and retention, whether the rate is realistic, and to determine the offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted high- quality work.  . . .  Where the Government found the incumbent rate 
to be reliable, and the offeror’s proposed rate was above the incumbent 
compensation levels, the proposed rate was determined to be realistic.  
 
* * * * * 
 In many cases the incumbent evaluation rate was well above (between 4 [percent]  and 42 [percent] ) market and competition.  Where the proposed 
rate was below the incumbent rate (envisioning compensation levels  Page 8 B-423341 et al.  lower than the incumbent), the Government evaluated the proposed rate 
“on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality 
work, and availability of required competent professional service employees ” by comparing to the competition average, Salary.com market 
data, and ERI market data.  Proposed rates higher than 4 [percent]  below 
any of these data points were determined to be realistic.  
 For rates where the incumbent rate was potentially unreliable as described above or where no incumbent rate was available, the Government further evaluated against both market data points and the competitive average.  The Government determined a rate to be 
unrealistic if it was 4  [percent]  or more below all data points, including the 
competitive average, Salary.com market data, ERI market data, and the incumbent rate (if available and reliable).  
 Id. at 26- 27.   
 The record shows that two- thirds of Abacus’s proposed rates were higher than the 
incumbent rates; the one- third of Abacus’s rates that fell below the incumbent rates 
were otherwise higher than at least one of the rates used by the agency for comparison (i.e., average competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  Id. at 28- 29.  The agency 
concluded that the price proposal submitted by Abacus was complete, reasonable, and balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  Id.  at 30.   
 In contrast, in its evaluation of SMS, the agency identified six labor category rates that 
were more than four percent below the rates used for comparison; in other words, SMS 
proposed rates below the incumbent rate, or where an incumbent rate was unavailable 
or unreliable, SMS proposed rates more than four percent below the average competition rate, ERI, and Salary.com.  The record does not support the protester’s argument that Abacus’s proposal should have been rejected because of its much lower price.  O n the contrary, the record shows that Abacus’s proposed labor rates were all 
higher than either the incumbent rates or the other data used by the agency ( i.e., 
average competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s conclusion that Abacus’s professional employee compensation plan was realistic and find that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the requirements of FAR provision 52.222- 46.

3 The protester maintains that the agency’s evaluation is flawed because the agency 
compared base hourly salary rates rather than fully burdened rates that would include fringe benefits.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 4- 7.  However, as explained by the 
agency, rather than using fully burdened rates, its evaluation utilized incumbent payroll data because this information provided actual employee salary information.  COS at 11-12.  Our Office has previously found that an agency’s use of burdened labor rates in an evaluation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 did not permit meaningful consideration of 
the compensation to be paid to employees.   See MicroTechnologies, LLC , B-413091,  
(continued...)   Page 9 B-423341 et al.   
The protester also argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus’s price under Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) provision 252.204- 7024 
and would have found Abacus to be unacceptable if it compared Abacus’s rates to historical pri ces paid.  Protest at 13- 14; 2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 7 -8.  SMS 
contends that under this DFARS clause, the agency was required to evaluate the price risk of Abacus’s total proposed price.  
 The DFARS provision 252.204- 7024 defines price risk as “a measure of whether a 
proposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.”  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(a).  The DFARS mandates that the 
suppl ier performance risk system (SPRS) be used in the evaluation of an offeror’s 
performance and requires the contracting officer to “ consider SPRS risk assessments 
during the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows:  . . . (2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is 
consistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. ”  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(c)(2).  
 The agency argues that it properly evaluated Abacus’s price in accordance with this requirement, and consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  MOL at 18- 22.  The 
contracting officer explains that SPRS functionality is currently limited to running a search based on a part number or other identification (such as a national item identification number or national stock number).  The contracting officer states that for 100 percent service contracts that are not associated with a part number or product code, the pr ice risk for that particular service is not available.  COS at 22- 23.  The 
record includes a declaration from the SPRS program manager, in which he confirms:  
 
At present time, if a service contract does not have an associated [Product Service Code (PSC)] or Manufacturer [Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)] Code with a Part Number or [National Item Identification Number (NIIN)], the SPRS Item/Price Risk Repo rt search will not be found 
which is equivalent to yielding a “not available” result, indicating there is no performance risk information in SPRS for that particular PSC/part number combination.  
 AR, Tab 130, Decl. of SPRS Program Manager at 2.   
 
 
B-413091.2, Aug. 11, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 219 at 8- 14.  Further, as noted, the agency 
also separately evaluated Abacus’s proposed fringe benefits and determined they were sufficient for recruitment and retention “when compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.”  AR, Tab 112, Abacus  Evaluation at 25.  We find this 
explanation is reasonable and that the evaluation satisfies the FAR requirement to evaluate each offeror’s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering 
the realism of the proposed professional compensati on and its impact upon recruiting 
and retention.   Page 10 B-423341 et al.  On this record, we find the agency’s explanation of how it used the SPRS reasonable 
and consistent with the requirements of DFARS provision 252.204- 7024.  Accordingly, 
this allegation is denied.4 
 After review of the initial agency report, the protester additionally contends that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis.  SMS argues that despite Abacus’s lower price, Abacus proposed labor category rates that were well abov e the incumbent rate, and the record fails to document why these rates were found 
to be reasonable.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 3 -4.  The agency argues that this 
allegation fails to state a valid basis of protest because the FOPR did not require a pri ce 
reasonableness assessment of individual labor category rates, and it properly evaluated total evaluated prices for reasonableness, consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  Supp. COS/MOL at 7 -9. 
 We agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require that the agency assess whether individual labor category rates were too high.  As our decisions have stated, the purpose of a price reasonableness review is to determine whether the prices offered are too high, as opposed to too low.  Tetra Tech, Inc. , B-409095, B -409095.2, Jan. 17, 
2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 108 at 7.  The solicitation clearly stated that total evaluated price would be evaluated for price reasonableness.  ITO Amend. 1 at 14, 19.  There w as 
nothing in the solicitation that provided for the agency to analyze individual labor rates for reasonableness.  Accordingly, we dismiss this argument because it fails to state a valid basis of protest.  Eagle Hill Consulting, LLC , supra.  
 
Misleading Discussions  
 The protester argues that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS because the agency informed SMS that some of its rates were unrealistically low and led SMS to increase its price yet made award to Abacus at a much lower evaluated price.  Pro test at 15.  The agency argues that exchanges were not misleading, and it 
reasonably  identified rates proposed by SMS that were found to be unrealistically low, 
but did not require that SMS increase them.  The agency avers that SMS elected to 
increase its price  rather than justify the rates it initially proposed and that SMS’s 
decision to raise its price fails to demonstrate that  the agency’s exchanges were 
misleading.   MOL at 22- 25. 
 The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not, as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement here.  Engineering Design Techs., Inc. , B-413281, Sept. 21, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 265 at 5.  In this regard, FAR 
 
4 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to determine whether Abacus had a 
score in the SPRS as required by the FOPR and DFARS provision 252.204- 7019 and 
clause 252.204- 7020.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 2- 3.  After review of the 
supplemental agency report, the protester withdrew this allegation.  Supp. Comments at 1.  Page 11 B-423341 et al.  section 16.505 does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order 
competition; nonetheless, when exchanges with the agency occur in task order competitions, they must be fair and not misleading.  CGI Fed. Inc. , B-403570 et al. ,  
Nov. 5, 2010, 2011 CPD ¶ 32 at 9.  In our decisions addressing an agency’s obligations in conducting discussions under FAR part 15, we have stated that an agency may not mislead an offeror through the framing of a discussion question into responding in a manner that does not address the agency’s actual concerns, or otherwise misinform the 
offeror concerning a problem with its proposal.  Refinery Assocs. of Texas, Inc. ,  
B-410911.2, Mar. 18, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 116 at 6.  
 As discussed, the agency identified six labor category rates that it considered to be unrealistic and issued a notice to SMS.
5  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation 
Interchange 003 at 2- 3.  That notice stated:  
 
SMS may choose to revise all or some of the rates at their own discretion or provide adequate justification that the current proposed rates are realistic and meet the criteria in FAR 52.222- 46.  If SMS revises their 
proposal, please utilize an updated complete Professional Compensation Matrix (Attachment 7).  If necessary, the Subcontractors may provide this updated attachment to the Government directly.  The supporting information for the proposed professional compensation information shall be included in the Contractor Response section below.  
 AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.  The record shows that SMS increased its price, and its final proposal was found to be complete, 
reasonable, balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  
AR, Tab 111, SMS Evaluation at 30.   
 The protester argues that blaming SMS for raising its price is not a fair response.  SMS contends that it had no choice but to raise its price and insists that making award at a lower price is evidence the discussions were misleading because it contradicts  the 
information given to SMS during exchanges.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 8- 9.  
However, the protester has not shown that following the price evaluation procedures, as discussed above, the agency’s concerns that the specific rates identified in the notice were incorrect.  And rather than give SMS no choice but to raise its price, the notice 
alternatively afforded SMS the opportunity to provide adequate justification that the initially proposed rates were realistic and met the criteria in FAR provisio n 52.222- 46.  
The protester elected to increase its price rather than provide additional justification to substantiate its initial rates.  Thus, the agency did not mislead the protester during discussions and instead properly identified a concern with the protester’s low rates.  In sum, the record does not support the protester’s contention that the agency misled SMS into increasing its labor rates and price.  Accordingly, we deny this allegation.  
 
 
5 The agency also identified rates proposed by SMS’s subcontractors found to be 
unrealistic.  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.   Page 12 B-423341 et al.  Best-Value Tradeoff  
 
Finally, SMS argues that t he agency  failed to perform and inadequately documented its  
best-value tradeoff .  The protester argues that the agency should have found Abacus’s 
proposal unacceptable, and but for the misleading discussions, SMS would have been 
awarded the contract.   Protest at 16.  The agency argues that the best -value decision is 
reasonable and, consistent with the FOPR, award to SMS at an approximately $12 million price premium cannot be justified.  MOL at 27- 28. 
 As noted, in its final evaluation of proposals, the agency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were technically acceptable with substantial confidence under the past performance factor, and Abacus proposed a lower price.  AR, Tab 120, FODD at 22.  The FOPR stated:  
 
All offerors judged to have a “Substantial Confidence” past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision Authority shall make an integrated assessment award decision to the offeror deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  
 ITO Amend. 1 at 14.  As discussed above, we find no merit to the protester’s challenge to the agency’s evaluation of Abacus’s price proposal or its argument that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS.  Thus, given the solicitation language,  we 
find no basis to conclude that the agency’s determination that Abacus presented the 
best value to the government is unreasonable.  
 The protest is denied.

B-423447,"May 7, 2025","Raven Investigations & Security Consulting, LLC","1.  Protest of sole- source order is dismissed as academic where the agency has 
terminated the order for the government’s convenience.  
 2.  Protester is advised that citation irregularities may result in the imposition of sanctions.  
DECISION  
 Raven Investigations & Security Consulting, LLC, a small business of Syracuse, Utah, protests the issuance of order  No. 70CDCR25FR0000032 to Universal Strategic 
Advisors LLC  (USA) , of Irvine, California, under request for quotation (RFQ) 
No. 70CDCR25Q00000007, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for administrative processing support services.  The protester contends that USA improperly obtained the order through use of 
nonpublic information; the agency issued the order without providing adequate notice 
and opportunity for competition; and the agency failed to properly consider an unsolicited proposal submitted by the protester.  The protester further alleges a violation of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 18 U.S.C. §  207, by USA’s chief executive 
officer, as well as unethical contracting practices by the agency.  
 We dismiss the protest  as academic based on the agency’s termination of the 
challenged order . 
  Page 2 B-423447  BACKGROUND  
 
On January  31, 2025, t he protester submitted a document to the agency proposing to 
provide investigative targeting support services.  Protest at  2; Req. for Dismissal at  1.  
The agency responded on February  25, stating that the document did not conform with 
the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 15.605 for unsolicited 
proposals, and that it therefore would not be evaluated.1  Req. for Dismissal at  1. 
 On February  28, the agency issued the RFQ --using the Federal Supply Schedule 
procedures of FAR subpart  8.4--by email directly to USA.
2  Id. at 2.  In connection with 
issuing the RFQ, the agency executed a limited sources justification pursuant to FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(A).  Id.  The agency issued the order to USA on March 14.  Id.  
On April 13, the agency published a notice of award and the limited sources justification 
on SAM.gov.  Id. 
 
Although the agency did not publish a notice of award until April  13, the protester 
learned of the March 14 order issuance on March 30.
3  Protest at  1.  The protester filed 
this protest with our Office on April  7. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Dismissal of the Protest as Academic  
 On April 14, the agency requested dismissal of the protest, arguing that the protester is 
not an interested party; the protest raises procurement integrity matters that are not 
proper protest issues for consideration by our Office; and the protest i s speculative and 
fails to state a detailed basis for protest.  See  Req. for Dismissal at  2-6.  On April  18, the 
intervenor also requested dismissal of the protest, raising arguments largely similar to 
those advanced by the agency.  See Intervenor Req. for Dismissal .  The protester 
responded to both of those requests for dismissal, opposing the arguments raised by 
the agency and intervenor.  See  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal; Resp. to Intervenor Req. 
for Dismissal.  
 
1 The protester refers to its submission as an unsolicited proposal, see Protest at  2, 
while the agency refers to it as a capability statement, see  Req. for Dismissal at  1.  It is 
not necessary to the resolution of this protest to ascertain the precise nature of the 
protester’s submission.

that the RFQ had a closing date of January  15, 2025.  Protest at  1.  The agency makes 
clear that it did not publicly post the RFQ, stating that it has no information to suppor t 
the protester’s allegation.  Req. for Dismissal at  2 n.3.

at 2.  Page 3 B-423447   
On April 22, prior to our Office’s  having the opportunity to decide the previously filed 
requests for dismissal , the agency notified our Office that it had terminated the order on 
April 18, and therefore requested that the protest be dismissed as academic .  Notice of 
Termination & Req. for Dismissal at  1.  The protester responded, opposing dismissal on 
the basis that the termination was a pretext to avoid review of the agency’s actions and 
was not based on programmatic need, contending that “the timing of t he contract 
termination--coming after the protest was filed and after [the agency] reviewed the substance of the allegations --raises a strong inference of bad faith. ”  Resp. to Notice of 
Termination & Req. for Dismissal at  1-2. 
 The jurisdiction of our Office is established by the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3551- 3557.  Our role in resolving

 Here, the agency has terminated the order issued to USA .  Additionally, as the agency 
issued the RFQ solely to USA, the termination of the order effectively cancels the RFQ as well.  When an agency terminates an awardee’s contract  and cancels the underlying 
solicitation , the agency’s actions render a protest challenging the contract award 
academic.   EDC Consulting, LLC et al. , B-414175.10 et al. , June 9, 2017, 2017 CPD

 Irregularities  in the Protester’s Filings  
 In reviewing the protester’s responses to the various requests for dismissal, we identified a number of irregularities in the case citations provided by the protester.  In 
some instances, the protester cited decisions of our Office that did not appear to s tate 
the principles for which the protester cited them.  In others, we were unable to locate a 
 
4 As discussed above, the protester opposes dismissal of the protest, arguing that the 
agency’s termination of the order is pretextual.  Our Office previously has discussed 
circumstances in which we will review an agency’s decision to terminate a contract i n 
response to allegations that the termination was a pretext to avoid review of the agency’s actions.  See, e.g. , Qbase, LLC , B-417371.4, B -417371.5, June 26, 2020, 
2020 CPD ¶ 252 at  3.  Whether the agency’s termination of the order was proper, 
however, is a separate question from whether the termination renders the instant protest academic.  To whatever extent the protester’s bare allegations of pretext here might support a contention that the termination constitutes improper corrective action taken in response to the protest,  the protester must separately file a timely protest of 
that corrective action in accordance with our Bid Protest Regulations.   Page 4 B-423447  decision that matched the citation provided by the protester , and decisions matching 
either the B -number or Comptroller General’s Procurement Decision s (CPD)  citation did 
not appear to state the principle for which the protester cited the decision.  In still others, 
we were unable to locate decisions matching one of either the B -number or CPD  
citation provided by the protester.  The protester also cited  what it represented to be 
direct quotations from certain decisions, but we were unable to locate those decisions  
using the citations provided; decisions matching some aspects of the citations did not contain the quoted language; and we were unable to locate any decisions of our Office containing the quoted language.  
 As a result, we requested that the protester submit comments (1)  addressing the basis 
for the case citations in its responses to the requests for dismissal; (2) providing copies of the cases cited in those responses; and (3) if the protester’s representati ve is an 
attorney, identifying the state(s) in which he is licensed to practice law.  Notice of Req. for Additional Briefing at  5.  In response, the protester confirmed that its representative 
is not a licensed attorney, and stated that he had “rel[ied] of  public databases, [artificial 
intelligence (AI)] -assisted tools, online case repositories, and secondary legal research 
summaries to guide [his] understanding of GAO precedent.”  Resp. to Req. for 
Additional Briefing at  1.  The protester stated that the identified irregularities “arose from 
reliance on these automated or secondary tools, which misrepresented or misattributed certain case law and st atutory language.”  Id.  
 As the U.S. Court of Federal Claims recently recognized, the use of AI programs to draft or assist in drafting legal briefs can--and seemingly often does --result in the citation of 
non-existent cases .  See  Sanders v. United States , No.  24-cv-1301, __ Fed. Cl.  __, 
2025 U.S. Claims LEXIS 697, at *9 -13 (discussing cases where attorneys and pro se 
litigants have cited  non-existent, AI -generated decisions).  To the extent the protester 
used AI tools to help draft its responses to the requests for dismissal  witho ut engaging 
in any review of the material for accuracy --resulting in the irregularities discussed 
above--that practice wastes the time of all parties and GAO, and is at odds with the statutory mandate that our bid protest forum provide for “the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests.”  31 U.S.C. §  3554(a)(1).  
 While courts have sanctioned both attorneys and pro se litigants for citing non- existent, 
AI-generated decisions pursuant to their applicable rules of procedure, see id. at *11- 13 
(collecting cases involving sanctions), those  rules do not apply in this forum.

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest of sole- source order is dismissed as academic where the agency has 
terminated the order for the government’s convenience.  
 2.  Protester is advised that citation irregularities may result in the imposition of sanctions.  
DECISION  
 Raven Investigations & Security Consulting, LLC, a small business of Syracuse, Utah, protests the issuance of order  No. 70CDCR25FR0000032 to Universal Strategic 
Advisors LLC  (USA) , of Irvine, California, under request for quotation (RFQ) 
No. 70CDCR25Q00000007, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for administrative processing support services.  The protester contends that USA improperly obtained the order through use of 
nonpublic information; the agency issued the order without providing adequate notice 
and opportunity for competition; and the agency failed to properly consider an unsolicited proposal submitted by the protester.  The protester further alleges a violation of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 18 U.S.C. §  207, by USA’s chief executive 
officer, as well as unethical contracting practices by the agency.  
 We dismiss the protest  as academic based on the agency’s termination of the 
challenged order . 
  Page 2 B-423447  BACKGROUND  
 
On January  31, 2025, t he protester submitted a document to the agency proposing to 
provide investigative targeting support services.  Protest at  2; Req. for Dismissal at  1.  
The agency responded on February  25, stating that the document did not conform with 
the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 15.605 for unsolicited 
proposals, and that it therefore would not be evaluated.1  Req. for Dismissal at  1. 
 On February  28, the agency issued the RFQ --using the Federal Supply Schedule 
procedures of FAR subpart  8.4--by email directly to USA.
2  Id. at 2.  In connection with 
issuing the RFQ, the agency executed a limited sources justification pursuant to FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(A).  Id.  The agency issued the order to USA on March 14.  Id.  
On April 13, the agency published a notice of award and the limited sources justification 
on SAM.gov.  Id. 
 
Although the agency did not publish a notice of award until April  13, the protester 
learned of the March 14 order issuance on March 30.
3  Protest at  1.  The protester filed 
this protest with our Office on April  7. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Dismissal of the Protest as Academic  
 On April 14, the agency requested dismissal of the protest, arguing that the protester is 
not an interested party; the protest raises procurement integrity matters that are not 
proper protest issues for consideration by our Office; and the protest i s speculative and 
fails to state a detailed basis for protest.  See  Req. for Dismissal at  2-6.  On April  18, the 
intervenor also requested dismissal of the protest, raising arguments largely similar to 
those advanced by the agency.  See Intervenor Req. for Dismissal .  The protester 
responded to both of those requests for dismissal, opposing the arguments raised by 
the agency and intervenor.  See  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal; Resp. to Intervenor Req. 
for Dismissal.  
 
1 The protester refers to its submission as an unsolicited proposal, see Protest at  2, 
while the agency refers to it as a capability statement, see  Req. for Dismissal at  1.  It is 
not necessary to the resolution of this protest to ascertain the precise nature of the 
protester’s submission.  
2 The protester alleges that the agency “posted” the RFQ on December  1, 2024, and 
that the RFQ had a closing date of January  15, 2025.  Protest at  1.  The agency makes 
clear that it did not publicly post the RFQ, stating that it has no information to suppor t 
the protester’s allegation.  Req. for Dismissal at  2 n.3.  
3 The agency states that, while it did not publish a notice of award on SAM.gov until 
April 13, contract award data was publicly released on the Federal Procurement Data 
System – Next Generation upon issuance of the order on March 14.  Req. for Dismissal 
at 2.  Page 3 B-423447   
On April 22, prior to our Office’s  having the opportunity to decide the previously filed 
requests for dismissal , the agency notified our Office that it had terminated the order on 
April 18, and therefore requested that the protest be dismissed as academic .  Notice of 
Termination & Req. for Dismissal at  1.  The protester responded, opposing dismissal on 
the basis that the termination was a pretext to avoid review of the agency’s actions and 
was not based on programmatic need, contending that “the timing of t he contract 
termination--coming after the protest was filed and after [the agency] reviewed the substance of the allegations --raises a strong inference of bad faith. ”  Resp. to Notice of

 Here, the agency has terminated the order issued to USA .  Additionally, as the agency

B-423319,"May 19, 2025","Digital Force Technologies, Inc","Protest challenging the issuance of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) 
program phase III solicitation for a sole- source contract  is denied where the record 
demonstrates that the agency is procuring work from a successor -in-interest entity that 
derives from, extends, or completes efforts of an acquired entity  performed under prior 
SBIR contracts . 
DECISION  
 Digital Force Technologies, Inc. (Digital Force), of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of Small Business Innovation Research p rogram ( SBIR) phase III sole -source 
solicitation  No. FA2381- 25-R- B004,  to Clear Align , LLC, of Nashua, New Hampshire, by 
the Department of the Air Force.  Digital Force contends that the SBIR phase III 
solicitation  was improper ly issued to Clear Align and that the agency is required to issue 
a competitive solicitation for its requirement.    
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small business concerns in federally funded research or research and development (R/R&D).  See  SBIR 
Program Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. § 638 (the “SBIR statute”).  Pursuant to this authority, 
certain federal agencies are required to provide a program under which a portion of the DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release without redactions. 
 
  Page 2     B-423319   agency’s  R/R&D effort is reserved for award to small business concerns.  See generally  
id.   
 
The SBIR program has three phases.  Under phase I, firms competitively apply for an award to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of a concept.  15 U.S.C. § 638(e)(4)(A).  If this is successful, a firm may be invited to appl y for a phase 
II award to further develop the concept.  Id. § 638(e)(4)(B).  A phase III award is defined 
as work that “derives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program.”  Id. § 638(e)(4)(C).  Under thi s phase, firms are 
expected to obtain funding from non- SBIR government sources or the private sector to 
develop the concept into a product for sale in private sector or military markets.  
 This protest involves the agency’s requirement for a tactical security system (TSS).  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 2.  Put simply, a TSS is a security and 
surveillance system.  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, July 2023 Requirements 
Document at  2.  Specifically, t he agency’s requirement is for an “increment 1” TSS 
which is described as a “modular, scalable, tailorable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground- based security and surveillance system.”   Id.; AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.    
 The contemplated TSS will provide ground- based tactical security and surveillance 
capability to assist security forces defenders in protecting personnel and mission assets at remote deployment locations.  AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.  The TSS will provi de 
“site situational awareness” through a network including motion detection, video assessment, and other sensing technologies integrated with command and control capability and connectivity to patrolling defenders.  Id.  Key requirements for the 
increment  1 TSS involve minimum coverage range, radar coverage, image assessment 
sensors, ability to operate in high winds, and a maximum weight.  COS at  2.   
 By way of background, in September of 2023, the agency sought to procure a different  
TSS, called increment  0.  COS at 3.  Based on its market research, the agency 
determined that Digital Force offered an “ increment  0” TSS, and on September 29, 
2023, the agency awarded Digital Force a sole- source contract for the increment  0 TSS.  
Id. at 3-4. 
 Also in September of 2023, the agency published a request for information (RFI) for the instant requirement, the increment  1 TSS.  Id. at 4.  Fourteen vendors responded, 
including Digital Force and Anduril Industries (Anduril).
1  Id. at 5.  Clear Align did not 
respond to this  RFI.  Id.   
 Over the next several months, the Air Force continued its  market research for the 
increment 1 TSS requirement .  On January  18, 2024, the agency published a second 
RFI on SAM.gov, the governmentwide point of entry  (GPE) .  Id.  Ten  vendors 
responded, including Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align.  Id.  at 5-8.  Additionally, the 
 
1 As discussed later in this decision, Anduril  (of Costa Mesa, California) is relevant to 
the procurement history .  Anduril is not a party to this protest.      Page 3     B-423319   agency published the same RFI to the General Services Administration (GSA) website.  
Id. at 7.  Four vendors responded to the RFI posted on GSA’s website, none of which 
were Digital Force, Anduril, or Clear Align .  Id.  The agency also directly contacted 
interested vendors via  email to share its systems requirement document (SRD) with 
those vendors and to solicit responses.  Id.  at 9.  
 Relevant here, the Air Force directly contacted Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align about  the increment 1 TSS requirement and provided them with the agency’s SRD .  Id. 
at 9-11.  Each of these firms responded to the inquiry.  Id.   The agency  also provided 
another RFI  to 16 small businesses  that had expressed interest in the increment 1 
acquisition.  Id.  at 11.  Clear Align, a small business concern, received this RFI.  Id.  
at 11-12. 
 Over the course of conducting its market research, the agency learned information which suggested that both Clear Align and Anduril could be eligible to receive an  SBIR 
phase III award for the increment 1 TSS.  Id. at 6, 12.   On August  20, 2024, the agency 
decided to fulfill the increment 1 TSS requirement via  an SBIR phase  III award , rather 
than pursuing a competitive procurement such as a competition under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.  Id. at 17.  T he agency then issued two sole- source 
SBIR pha se III solicitations  for the  same increment 1 TSS  requirement ; one to Clear 
Align and one to Anduril.  Id.    
 On September 3, Digital Force learned that the agency  would pursue its increment 1 
TSS requirement  via an SBIR phase III award.  Id. at 21.  Ten days later, Digital Force 
filed an agency -level protest challenging the agency’s decision to pursue an  SBIR 
phase III award  rather than conducting a competition for the TSS requirement .

at 22; AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  11-20.   
 
The protester argued that the Air Force’s  increment  1 TSS requirement was not eligible 
to be awarded through a sole-source SBIR p hase III solicitation because it did not 
derive from, extend, or complete efforts from a previous SBIR award,  as (according to 
the protester) the requirement did not include original concepts, findings, ideas, or 
research results generated by a previous SBIR effort.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level 
Protest at  14-15.  Further, t he protester claimed  that the agency’s use of SBIR authority 
was inappropriate because the requirement was for existing capabilities available from Digital Force and the commercial marketplace, and therefore the requirement should be competed.  Id. at 15.  According to Digital Force, SBIR phase III authority was not 
intended to apply to a scenario (like here)  where competing technologies are available 
 
2 Digital Force also argued that the Air Force improperly failed to publish a notification of 
its sole -source justification to the GPE.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  18-19.  
The agency denied this protest ground, finding that it was not required  to publish to the 
GPE a justification and approval document for actions related to an  SBIR phase  III 
award.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at  6-7.  This protest ground is not 
included in the instant protest and therefore we do not address it further.   Page 4     B-423319   to meet the agency’s need.  Id. at 17.  On September 23, the Air Force denied the 
agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at 7.  
 
On October 3, Digital Force filed a protest with our Office, challenging the SBIR phase III solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril for the increment 1 TSS.  COS 
at 23.  In that protest, Digital Force challenged the Air Force’s authority to procure the 
increment 1 TSS via  an SBIR phase  III award rather than a competitive acquisition.   AR, 
Tab 23, First GAO Protest at  18-27.  In response, the Air Force filed a notice of 
corrective action, stating that the agency would cancel the solicitations issued to Clear 
Align and Anduril, and issue a new solicitation that “more clearly addresses competition issues and best meets the needs of the Air Force.”  AR, Tab 26, Notice of Corrective Action at  2.  On November 21, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Digital 
Force Techs., Inc. , B-423029, Nov.  21, 2024 (unpublished decision).  
 As part of its corrective action, the Air Force canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril.  COS at  24.  The Air Force concluded that issuing a single SBIR 
phase III solicitation to Clear Align for the increment 1 TSS would address the identified 
competition concerns, as “there would not be any further confusion associated with the release of simultaneous sole source SBIR Phase III solicitations[.]”   Id. at 25.  On 
December 9, the Air Force decided to pursue the increment 1 TSS requirement via  a 
single SBIR phase  III solicitation issued to Clear Ali gn.  Id.  On December 20, Clear 
Align submitted its proposal.  Id.  at 25- 26.   
 On January 22, 2025, Digital Force requested a status update on the corrective action.  AR, Tab 36, Email from Digital Force to Agency, Jan. 22, 2025.  In response, the Air 
Force stated that it had canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril, reassessed its market research, and decided to issue a single SBIR phase III 
solicitation for the increment 1 TSS requirement.  Id. , Email from Agency to Digital 
Force, Jan. 27, 2025.  The agency subsequently confirmed that the new solicitation had 
been issued to Clear Align .  Id., Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 30, 2025.  The 
agency further stated that  Clear Align’s proposed solution derives from, extends, and 
completes work from two prior SBIR phase II awards ; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 
and contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069.   Id.  The record reflects that no award has been 
made.   AR, Tab 36, Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 27, 2025; Memorandum of 
Law ( MOL ) at 6.  On February 6, Digital Force filed the instant protest with our Office.  
 DISCUSSION  Digital Force challenges the Air F orce’s issuance of  an SBIR phase  III solicitation  to 
Clear Align , arguing that  the agency’s requirement for an increment 1 TSS does not 
derive from, extend, or complete the relevant  SBIR phase  II efforts .  The protester 
further argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an SBIR phase III award because the relevant SBIR phase II contracts were awarded to a firm called Computer 
Optics, not Clear Align , and Clear Align does not qualify as a successor -in-interest  entity  
to Computer Optics .  As relief, Digital Force requests the Air Force rescind the SBIR 
phase III solicitation and issue a competitive solicitation under which Digital Force can  Page 5     B-423319   compete.   The Air Force defends its procurement on all grounds.  As discussed below, 
we deny the protest.3  
 
Contracting agencies have broad discretion to determine their needs and the best way 
to meet them.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. , B-402530, B -402530.2, May 17, 
2010, 2010 CPD ¶  117 at 3.  We have recognized this discretion with respect to the 
SBIR program, and in reviewing the propriety of a phase I or II SBIR award, we have found that our review is limited to determining whether the agency violated any applicable regulations or solicitation provisions or acted in bad faith.  Wang Electro- Opto 
Corp. , B-418523, June 4, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 187 at 5; U S Positioning Grp., LLC , 
B-294027, June 21, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 133 at 3.   
 With respect to SBIR phase III,  the SBIR statute and policy guidance provide relatively 
limited requirements to justify an award.   The relevant portion of the statute states that 
the SBIR program will include, “where appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program in which commercial applications of SBIR -funded research or research 
and development are funded by non- Federal sources of capital or, for products or 
services intended for use by the Federal Government, by follow -on non- SBIR Federal 
funding awards[.]”  15 U.S.C. §  638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that “[t]o the 
greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that  developed the technology.  Id.  § (r)(4).    
 The policy directive  defines SBIR phase III work in a similar manner .  SBIR/Small 
business Technology Transfer (STTR)  Policy Directive ( May 2023)  § 4(c)  (“Phase III 
refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR/STTR Funding Agreements”).   The policy directive clarifies that a federal agency 
may enter an  SBIR phase III agreement at any time with an  SBIR phase II awardee and 
explains that an  SBIR phase III awardee may be a party that  received an  SBIR phase I 
or phase II award, been novated a phase I or phase II award, or is  a 
successor -in-interest entity.  Id. 
 Given these limited requirements and the significant discretion afforded to agencies in this area, the core issue s we must resolve are whether the Air Force reasonabl y 
concluded that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS derives from, extend s, or complet es 
efforts made under prior SBIR awards  and whether Clear Align qualifies as a successor 
in interest entity to Computer Optics, which completed the prior SBIR efforts .  As 
discussed below, we deny the protest.  
 
 
3 Digital Force raises other collateral arguments.  Although our decision does not 
address each argument raised, we have reviewed them all and find that none provide a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6     B-423319   Eligibility for  an SBIR Phase III Award  
 
The protester first contends that the relevant authority requires the agency to define its 
SBIR phase III requirement to derive from, extend, or complete prior SBI R effort s and 
that here, the Air Force’s requirement as described in the solicitation and market research documents does not derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  Second, Digital Force contends that Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS  is 
ineligible for an SBIR phase III award because it allegedly does not derive from, extend, 
or complete a prior SBIR effort .   
  
 Challenge to the Agency’s Requirement   
 As stated above, the protester argues the agency’s requirement must derive from, 
extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts , and that just because a proposed solution may 
derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort, that does not mean the requirements qualify for a SBIR phase III acquisition.  Protest at  22-25; Comments at  4.  
In this context, the protester  asserts that the solicitation states  general requirements for 
an increment 1 TSS solution that were developed separately from and without reference to prior SBIR efforts.  Protest  at 24.  As a result, Digital Force maintains that the 
requirements themselves do not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  In other words, Digital Force  contends that the requirement as described by the 
agency --as opposed to the solution proposed by Clear Align--must show that it derives 
from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort.  
 The Air Force disagrees.   As an initial note, the agency does not contest the protester’s 
contention that its requirement does not derive from a prior SBIR effort.   However, the 
agency  asserts  the protester incorrectly focus es the analysis on the agency’s 
requirements rather than on the work to be acquired.  COS at  28; MOL at 14.   The Air 
Force argues that the SBIR statute and the SBIR/STTR policy directive  require SBIR 
phase III awards to be for work  that derives from, extends, or completes  prior SBIR 
efforts, not for requirements  that derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  
MOL at  14; see 15 U.S.C. §  638 (e)(4)(C)  (phase III is “for work that derives from, 
extends, or completes efforts[.]” ); SBIR/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023)  § 4(c) 
(“Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort”).   As 
discussed below, we agree with the Air Force.  
 Our analysis begins with the interpretation of the relevant statute.  See Curtin Mar. Corp. , B-417175.2, Mar. 29, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 117 at 9.  In construing the statute, t he 
first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.   PublicRelay , B-421154, 
B-421154.2, Jan.  17, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶  23 at  5.  In this regard, we begin with the 
language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that langu age accurately expresses the legislative purpose.   Id.  If the statutory language is 
clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.  Id.  Our Office 
likewise applies the “plain meaning” rule of statutory interpretation.  Id. 
  Page 7     B-423319   The SBIR statute explains that the SBIR program includes a phased structure including: 
“where appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes 
efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program .”  15 U.S.C. 
§ 638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that “[t]o the greatest extent practicable, 
Federal agencies . . . shall . . . consider an award under the SBIR program . . . to satisfy 
[relevant competition requirements]; and . . . issue, without further justificat ion, Phase III 
awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that developed the technology.”  Id. § (r)(4).  
 While not a regulation, t he SBIR/STTR policy directive provides interpretive guidance 
and states in relevant part : 
 
(c) Phase III. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR/STTR Funding Agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR/STTR programs.  Phase III 
work is typically oriented towards C ommercialization of SBIR/STTR 
research or technology, including through further R/R&D work.    
 
(1) Phase III work:   Each of the following types of activity 
constitutes SBIR/STTR Phase III work:  
 
(i) Commercial application . . . of SBIR/STTR funded 
R/R&D that is financed by non- Federal sources of 
capital. . . .    
 
(ii) SBIR/STTR- derived products or services intended 
for use by the Federal Government, funded by non-
SBIR/STTR sources of Federal funding.    
 
(iii) Continuation of SBIR/STTR work, funded by non-SBIR/STTR sources of Federal funding including R/R&D.   
 SBIR/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) § 4(c) .  Further, the policy directive states that 
“[p]hase III work may be for products, production, services, R/R&D, or any such combination.”  Id. § 4(c)(4).  
 Based on the authority and guidance cited above, we find that SBIR phase III  
unambiguously refers to  the work to be acquired,  not the agency’s requirement.  Indeed, 
the statute and the policy directive each expressly use the word “work” when explaining SBIR phase III ; they do not mention the agency’s requirement.  15 U.S.C. 
§ 638(e)(4)(C); SBIR/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) § 4(c).  Therefore, we agree 
with the Air Force’s interpretation of the SBIR phase III authority ; a proper SBIR phase  Page 8     B-423319   III award is for work  that derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .4  
Accordingly, we deny the protest ground arguing that the Air Force improperly issued an  
SBIR phase III solicitation to Clear Align because the agency’s requirement  does not 
derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  Digital Force’s protest ground 
misapplies  the relevant law and policy directive and therefore does not provide a basis 
to sustain the protest.5  
 
 Challenge to the Work to be Procured:  Clear Align’s Proposed Increment 1 TSS   
 Digital Force argues that the Air Force has not properly determined that  Clear Align’s 
proposed increment 1 TSS in fact derives from, extends, or completes the prior relevant 
SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32- 38.  First, the protester  
argues that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS does not qualify for  an SBIR phase III award 
because the record does not demonstrate the required link between the prior SBIR efforts and the proposed increment 1 TSS.  Protest at  28-29; Comments at  24-29.  In 
support of this argument, t he protester asserts that the Air Force did not  review the prior 
SBIR phase II efforts  to understand what was developed, nor did  the Air Force review 
the proposed increment 1 TSS to ensure it derived from, extended, or completed those SBIR phase II efforts.  Comments at  21-29.  Second, Digital Force argues that the Air 
Force is improperly using SBIR phase III authority because only a single component of 
the system to be acquired could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant 
prior SBIR efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  Prior to discussing the 
arguments, for context, we provide a brief explanation o f the solicitation and Clear 
Align’s  proposed increment 1 TSS.   
 
 
4 We note that Digital Force recognizes this distinction in other areas of its pleadings.  
See e.g. , Comments at 21 (“The Air Force does not dispute that . . . the acquisition must 
involve ‘work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts’”) . 
5 The protester’s focus on the agency’s requirements, as opposed to Clear Align’s work, 
may be a distinction without a difference.  In this regard, an agency’s requirements are 
not necessarily irrelevant to the determination of whether a procurement can properly be awarded as a n SBIR phase III.  Indeed, in some cases we have analyzed the 
agency’s requirements in SBIR p hase III  matters .  See, e.g. , Toyon Research 
Corporation, B -409765, Aug. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶  235 ( Toyon) ; PublicRelay , supra.  In 
those cases, the protester s argued that the agency’s requirements actually required the 
award of SBIR phase III agreements  on sole- source bases to the respective protester , 
and therefore we necessarily focused our analysis on the agency’s requirements.  
However, as explained above, the statute and policy directive clearly state that SBIR phase III refers to the work that will be performed.  Therefore, while an agency’s 
requirements may be relevant to the analysis of whether a procurement constitutes an  
SBIR phase III procurement , the requirements themselves do not need to derive from, 
extend, or complete a prior phase I or II effort in order for an agency to properly use SBIR phase III.   Page 9     B-423319   As noted above, the agency issued a solicitation to Clear Align requesting a proposal to 
deliver the TSS, “which shall contain SBIR -derived technology.”  AR, Tab 34, 
Solicitation at 5.  The solicitation instructed Clear Align to submit three volumes.   Id.  As 
relevant here, the third volume had to contain “all information regarding Clear Align’s SBIR- derived technology in its [] -TSS solution.”  Id. at 8.  This volume had to identify the 
SBIR- derived components and relevant SBIR awards, explain how the ident ified 
components derived from the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards, and include any test or production documentation associated with the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards.  Id.  
 In its proposal, Clear Align  stated that it s proposed increment 1 TSS system is called 
the Mamba.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Clear Align describe d the Mamba 
as a “ turnkey ” solution meet ing all of the Air Force’s operational and technical 
requirements  as described in the SRD  and statement of work .  Id.  The Mamba includes 
an image assessment sensor on a pan tilt unit  based on Clear Align’s Z 320 medium 
wave infrared (MWIR) camera.  Id.  According to Clear Align, t he Z 320 MWIR camera 
implements technology from two prior SBIR efforts, SBIR topic No.  N-01-016 and SBIR 
topic No.  AF071- 280, resulting in contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. 
FA9453- 08-C0069, respectively .
6  Id. at 103-104; see also COS at  31. 
 Under SBIR topic No. N01 -016, Clear Align developed optical fabrication processes for 
infrared materials  (specifically , germanium ).  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  104.  
Under this topic, optical polishing techniques were developed which enabled accurate polishing of large optical components.  Id.  Clear Align a lso developed optical coating 
removal processes, and optical coatings with increased optical efficiency and durability.  
Id.   
 Under SBIR topic No. AF071- 280, Clear Align designed a broadband image optic using 
a high performance opto- mechanism design to receive information using a multi -band 
sensor.  Id.  at 105.  Under this topic, engineering principles and designs were 
developed to allow smaller and more cost -effective optical systems to be designed and 
built which would maintain imaging performance over a wide temperature range.  Id.  
 Clear Align’s proposal stated  that following its prior SBIR efforts, it continued to invest in 
zoom lens design and fabrication methods to further advance zoom lens technology to create higher -performance infrared zoom cameras.  Id. at 107.  Clear Align explained 
that its current generation of zoom cameras  are high- definition systems that use small 
pixel pitch technology to offer  image clarity and range performance.  Id.  The firm further 
state d that key design concepts from the prior SBIR efforts have been refined and are 
embedded into its current generation of cameras.  Id. at 107. 
 
 
6 There is no dispute that the prior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics, 
not Clear Align.  However, for simplicity and because Clear Align was issued the solicitation as a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, our discussion in this 
area references the prior SBIR efforts as completed by Clear Align.    Page 10     B-423319   Digital Force argues  that Clear Align’s proposed TSS solution does not qualify for  an 
SBIR phase III award because it does not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR 
effort  and that the record does not support the Air Force’s  conclusion that an  SBIR 
phase III award is proper .  As previously noted, the Air Force issued the instant SBIR 
phase III solicitation to Clear Align based on two prior SBIR phase II efforts completed 
by a firm called Computer Optics, under a theory that Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Co mputer Optics.  COS at 31 -34.   
 Digital Force argues the record does not support a conclusion that the Air Force reviewed the relevant SBIR phase II efforts before determining that Clear Align’s proposed SBIR phase III increment 1 TSS derived from, extended, or completed those prior SBIR efforts.  Comments at  21-24.  Rather, Digital Force contends that the agency 
simply accepted--without any scrutiny --Clear Align’s explanation in its proposal that its 
increment 1 TSS solution derives from, extends, or completes work from its prior SBIR efforts.   
 Digital Force  also argues that the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III to 
acquire a system where only a single component of the system could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant prior SBIR efforts --the Z 320 MWIR camera.  
Protest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  The protester argues that even if the Z 320 
MWIR camera qualifies  as deriving from a prior SBIR effort (which it contests) , the Air 
Force cannot properly use SBIR phase III authority to procure its entire TSS s ystem  
where the only component of the system deriving from the SBIR program might be the 
Z 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 32.  
 
In raising  this challenge,  Digital Force contends  that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS  is 
not an  SBIR- derived produc t because it  consists of several  discrete components, many 
of which are commercially available off -the-shelf (COTS) items  available from multiple 
sources , and that the only components provided by  Clear Align itself are the Z 320 
MWIR camera and an electro- optic camera.  Id.  at 32-33.  For example, Digital Force 
highlights  Clear Align ’s proposed use of  COTS components  in its overall system  
includ ing a ruggedized laptop, a ruggedized tablet, radios, cables, ancillary equipment, 
and a lift mast.  Id.  at 33.    
 According to the protester, here, the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III authority to procure work ( i.e., the COTS items included in the TSS) which does not 
derive from, extend, or complete the prior SBIR effort.  Id.  at 34.  As a hypothetical 
example to illustrate its point, Digital Force argues that under the Air Force’s interpretation of the SBIR statute, a large defense contractor could purchase the rights to Clear Align’s Z 320 MWIR camera, install the camera on a  C-40 aircraft, and win an  
SBIR phase III award for the Air Force’s C -40 fleet expansion program.  Id. at 36-37 
n.115.    
 The Air Force defends its procurement.   MOL at 17- 21.  According to the agency, the 
record clearly demonstrates that the SBIR phase III solicitation was properly issued to  Page 11     B-423319   Clear Align for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts.  Id. 
at 18.   
 The Air Force notes that the SBIR statue describes the SBIR program as including a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts, but argues that the statute does not “define or explain” the meaning of that language.  Id.  
at 18.  Based on the statutory language, t he Air Force asserts  that procuring agencies 
have broad discretion to assess how an underlying SBIR effort is “essential to the goal of a SBIR Phase III contract [,]” and that, contrary to the protest ground, nothi ng in the 
relevant authority suggests that “an entire solution or set of requirements must be wholly derived from the underlying effort. ”  Id. at 20.  Furthermore, the Air Force argues 
that the record contains sufficient documentation explaining how Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS was considered and how it was determined that SBIR phase III authority properly  applies to the instant procurement.  Id.  at 21.  As discussed below, we 
find no basis to sustain the protest.  
 With respect to an  SBIR phase III award, our Office has previously found that to show 
one effort derives from, extends, or completes another, “it must be evident that the requirements for the second effort incorporated original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results  that were generated in the first.”  ASRC Federal Data Network 
Technologies, LLC , B-418765, Aug.  28, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  339 at  6 (citing  Toyon at 16 
n.15; see also PublicRelay , supra at 9 n.7.   As discussed more below, we find that the 
“original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results” language is not , however,  the 
appropriate test for the instant protest given its posture.   That is, here, we are examining 
whether proposed work derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts; we are 
not examining whether the agency’s  stated requirement derives from prior SBIR efforts.  
 Relying on the language in Toyon and PublicRelay , Digital Force argues that this 
procurement does not qualify for  SBIR phase III because the agency’s requirement 
does  not incorporate original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were 
generated in Clear Align’s prior SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at 23- 27; Comments 
at 30-32.  However, as explained above, SBIR phase III refers to work that derives from, 
extends, or completes efforts performed under prior SBIR phase I or II awards.  An agency’ s requirements are not dispositive as to whether a procurement can utilize  SBIR 
phase III.   
 Moreover, in Toyon and PublicRelay , our Office was analyzing protests arguing that  the 
agency was required to award SBIR phase III agreements to the respective protesters . 
The protesters  argued that they should have received sole- source awards because the 
agency  sought contractors to perform requirements that the protesters argued were 
derived from the work the protesters had completed under prior SBIR efforts , or that the 
agency was requiring the contractor s to extend or complete the work they had 
previously done.  Accordingly, our focus was on whether the government ’s 
requirements  were based on work previously done by the protesters .   
  Page 12     B-423319   In contrast, here,  the agency  is making a sole- source award to Clear Align  for its  
proposed TSS solution , which is based on work Clear  Align has proposed in order  to 
meet the agency’s operational requirement .  In this context, t he relevant  question is 
whether that proposed solution derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed 
under the relevant  SBIR phase II awards.   Accordingly, we do not agree with the 
protester  that the litmus test for determining whether this solicitation  is properly issued 
using SBIR phase III is whether the agency’s requirements incorporate original 
concepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were generated in prior SBIR phase I 
or II efforts.7   
 In this posture,  and given the broad language used by the SBIR statute and the 
SBIR/STTR policy directive  to describe SBIR phase III and the lack of  a precise 
explanation as to what qualifies as work der iving from , extending , or complet ing a prior 
SBIR effort , we will review the record to determine whether the agency reasonably 
concluded that this procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III in a manner that is 
consistent with all applicable laws  and regulations.
8  
 As detailed above, the instant solicitation was issued to Clear Align following several months of market research.  The contracting officer explains that in determining whether 
SBIR phase III authority could be used for the instant procurement, the agency  
concluded that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS constituted work deriving from two prior 
SBIR- funded efforts; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. 
FA9453- 08-C-0069.   COS at  28.  As part of this analysis, the agency prepared an SBIR 
phase III determi nation and findings (D&F) , and a commercial item D&F, on Clear 
Align’s increment 1 TSS.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F; AR, Tab 32 Commercial 
Item D&F.  
 
In the SBIR phase III D&F, the agency concluded that Clear Align’s TSS derives from prior SBIR efforts and that Clear Align is therefore eligible for a sole- source contract 
 
7 Moreover, we clarify that the test in Toyon represented one potential approach to 
determine whether a procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III when analyzing an 
agency’s requirements .  That is, whether those requirements incorporate original 
concepts, findings, ideas, or research results.  We think such an approach provides a 
reasonable assessment of whether the agency intends to procure a solution from contractors that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR phase I or II efforts 
based on a review of the agency’s requirements.  Here, the analysis is focused on whether the agency reasonably concluded that Clear Align’s proposed work --the 
TSS--derived from, extended, or completed efforts performed under prior SBIR awards.  
8 We note that the SBIR/STTR policy directive provides three “types of activit [ies]” that 
constitute SBIR phase III work , but no precise explanation.  SBIR/STTR Policy Directive 
(May 2023) §§ 4(c)(1)(i)- (iii).  For example, the policy directive lists as a type of activity 
constituting SBIR/STTR phase III work, “SBIR/STTR- derived products or services 
intended for  use by the Federal Government, funded by non- SBIR/STTR sources of 
Federal funding.” Id.  § (4)(c)(1)(ii).   Page 13     B-423319   pursuant to 15 U.S.C. section 638(r)(4) .  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  4; see 15 
U.S.C. §  638(r)(4)  (stating that to the greatest extent practicable, federal agencies shall 
issue, without further justification, phase III awards relating to technology, including 
sole-source awards, to the SBIR award recipient that developed the technology).   
Included as attachments in the SBIR phase III D&F a re copies of the prior SBIR efforts 
performed by Computer Optics , the firm subsequently acquired by Clear Align .  AR, 
Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 
(contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404).          
 The SBIR phase III D&F memorialized the agency’s consideration of the relevant SBIR phase II efforts and explained their relevance to the instant procurement.  Id. at 2-4.  
First, the D&F explained that work performed under contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069 
facilitated the development of engineering principles and designs that enabled a smaller and more cost -effective Z 320 MWIR camera system that will be provided in Clear 
Align’s TSS.  Id.  at 2-3, 220.   Second, the D&F explained that contract 
No. N68335- 02-C-0404 resulted in three developments which were incorporated into 
Clear Align’s TSS:  accurate polishing of infrared materials, enhanced durability of optical anti -reflection infrared coatings, and optical fabrication of infrared components 
with challenging geometries and high levels of curvature.   Id. at 4.  The agency 
ultimately concluded that Clear Align’s proposed TSS “directly benefits from the work performed under the two SBIR Phase II awards” because those prior SBIR efforts “enhanced the performance, manufacturability, and environmental res istance of the 
Z 320 MWIR camera[.]”  Id.  
 In the commercial item D&F, the agency determined that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS 
met the definition of a commercial product with minor modifications.  AR, Tab 32, Commercial Item D&F at  2.  In reaching this conclusion, the agency found that Clear 
Align ’s TSS was assigned commercial part number VZ320HD -3000, the TSS included 
Clear Align’s Z 320 MWIR camera,  which has been commercialized since 2023, the 
Z 320 MWIR camera used for the TSS included a minor modification to meet size and 
weight requirements established in the agency’s SRD, and that the minor modification did not alter the essential characteristics of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Id. at 2-3.  The 
agency found that the SBIR -derived component of the TSS, the Z 320 MWIR camera, 
accounted for 32 percent of the total cost per TSS unit, and that the TSS included other major components that are COTS items.  Id.  at 3-4. 
 As discussed above, Digital Force argues that the Air Force unreasonably concluded (and insufficiently documented its conclusion)  that Clear Align’s solution qualified for  an 
SBIR phase III  award.   The protester also argues  that the agency is improperly using 
SBIR phase III authority to acquire a system largely composed of COTS components 
where only a single component of the system , the Z 320 MWIR camera,  could have 
possibly derive d from, extended, or completed  the relevant prior SBIR efforts .  Protest 
at 27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32-38.  We have reviewed these challenges and find no 
basis to sustain the protest.   Based on our review of the record, we decline to disturb 
the Air Force’s conclusion that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS derives from, extends, or  Page 14     B-423319   completes prior SBIR efforts.  The record shows that the agency reasonably concluded 
Clear Align’s proposed solution derives from work developed under prior SBIR efforts.    
 
Contrary to Digital Force’s arguments, t he record includes  sufficient evidence and 
support showing how the  Air Force reached its conclusion that the proposed increment 
1 TSS derived from a prior SBIR effort.  This includes  copies of the prior SBIR 
contracts , which list the details of the work to be completed under those contracts, a 
copy of the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS, a copy of Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS, an explanation of the SBIR -derived technology in Clear 
Align’s  proposed solution, and D&F documents evaluating the proposed increment 1 
TSS against the prior SBIR efforts.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at 1- 4 
(analysis),  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 (contract 
No. N68335- 02-C-0404); AR, Tab 34, Solicitation; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal.    
 As previously discussed, the SBIR statute and policy directive set forth very limited requirements to justify a n SBIR phase III solicitation or award.  The record here contains 
ample documentation and evidentiary support showing how the Air Force reasonably concluded that Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS derives from the relevant prior 
SBIR phase  II contracts.   
 To the extent that Digital Force criticizes the agency’s review of the prior SBIR phase II efforts or its review of Clear Align’s proposal, we find that such criticism amounts to disagreement with the agency’s judgments which does not provide a basis to sustain this protest.   See MiMoCloud , B-419482, Mar.  25, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  157 at  7.  While 
the protester may wish the agency had done more independent research or analysis by 
going outside of the contents of Clear Align’s proposal in some way, the protester cites no authority requiring such an effort.
9     
 In addition, we find no basis to sustain the protester’s argument that the agency is improperly using SBIR phase III to procure a system that is made up of COTS components and only a single component could qualify for  an SBIR phase III  award.  In 
this regard, Digital Force points to no statue, regulation, or other legal authority stating that an agency may not use SBIR phase III authority to procure a system where only a 
component of the overall system derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .  Here, the agency is procuring a security system that requires, for example, 
surveillance capability, motion detection, video assessment, and sensing technologies, and Clear Align is providing within its overall system, an  SBIR- derived camera.  AR, 
Tab 34, Solicitation at  39; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Thus, the 
SBIR- derived component is reasonably related to the overall objective of the system the 
agency seeks to procure.  Accordingly, this procurement is not similar to Digital Force’s hypot hetical example and cautionary tale involving the Air Force’s C -40 fleet expansion 
program .   
 
9 For example, Digital Force opines that the Air Force could have produced evidence 
that engineers “performed a technical analysis” of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 26.   Page 15     B-423319    
In sum, there simply is no requirement in statute or the policy directive that the entirety 
of a phase III solution must be derived from prior SBIR efforts.   As such , we find that the 
Air Force reasonably concluded Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS derived from the relevant SBIR phase II efforts, and that the record sufficiently supports the agency’s conclusion.   This protest ground is denied.  
 SBIR Phase III Successor -in-Interest Entities  
 Digital Force argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an  SBIR phase III contract 
because Clear Align is not a proper successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, the 
firm that completed the prior  SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  20 n.61; Comments 
at 16-21.  In this regard, Digital Force argues that Clear  Align does not meet the 
definition of a successor -in-interest entity , as defined by the SBIR/STTR policy directive.  
Comments at  19-21.  Digital Force alleges that the record does not support a conclusion 
that Clear Align acquired Computer Optics and that Clear Align’s proposal misrepresents the merger of the relevant companies.  Id. at 16-18.  As discussed below, 
we deny the protest.
10  
 Relevant here, t he SBIR statue includes the following language:  
 
In general.  In the case of a small business concern that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR program, a Federal agency m ay enter into a Phase III agreement with that business concern 
for additional work to be performed during or after the Phase II period.  
 
* * * * * 
 To the greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients  that 
developed the technology.  
 
 
10 Digital Force also challenges the agency’s reliance on the SBIR/STTR policy 
directive’s guidance for successor -in-interest firms.  Comments at 18 -19.  According to 
the protester, the SBIR/STTR policy directive conflicts with the SBIR statute, which, accor ding to the protester, does not contemplate SBIR phase III awards to any business 
concern other than the concern that completed the prior SBIR effort.  Id. (citing 
15 U.S.C. §  638(r)(1)) ; see SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) § 6(a)(5) .  We 
dismiss this protest ground as untimely.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(2).  In the protest , Digital 
Force recognized t he relevance of  Clear Align ’s status as a successor -in-interest  entity  
to Computer Optics  but did not  challenge the SBIR/STTR policy directive’s guidance on 
success- in-interest firms as inconsistent with the SBIR statut e.  Protest at 20 n.61.  
Because the challenge appear s for the first time in Digital Force’s comments on the 
agency report, it is untimely.   4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(2).   Page 16     B-423319   15 U.S.C. §§  638(r)(1), (4).  
 
In implementing the SBIR statute, the SBIR/STTR policy directive explains that:  
 
An SBIR/STTR Awardee may include, and SBIR/STTR work may be performed by, those identified via a “novated” or “successor in interest” or similarly -revised Funding Agreement.  For example, a Phase III Awardee 
may have either received a prior Phase I or Phas e II award or been 
novated a Phase I or Phase II award (or received a revised Phase I or Phase II award if a grant or cooperative grant) or be a successor -in-interest entity.  
 SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) §  6(a)(5).
11   
 As previously  discussed, the agency determined that Clear Align’s proposed 
increment  1 TSS included  work deriv ing from two prior SBIR efforts .  See AR, Tab 35, 
Clear Align Proposal at  103-104; see also COS at  31.  There is no dispute that these 
prior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics.  See AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase 
III D&F at  165 ( showing contract No. FA9453- 08-C-0069 issued to Computer Optics ); 
Id. at 221 ( showing contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 issued to Computer Optics ).  
Accordingly, the question we must answer is whether Clear Align properly qualifies as an eligible  SBIR phase III awardee on the theory that it is a successor -in-interest entity 
to Computer Optics.   
 Clear Align’s proposal explained that Clear Align acquired the assets of Computer 
Optics on March 26, 2013.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  The proposal 
state d that all “intellectual property including, without limitation, patents, computer 
software, data, trademarks, trade secrets, know -how, processes, formulae, designs, 
drawings, and technical data were assigned to Clear Align, LLC at the closing of the sale.”   Id.  Included as an attachment to the proposal wa s an excerpt of the asset 
purchase agreement entered into between Clear Align and Computer Optics.
12  Id. 
at 109-110. 
 
 
11 When the SBA updated this language regarding a successor -in-interest , it stated that 
“[a]n entity may be considered a successor -in-interest, if it has secured the transfer of: 
(1) All the small business concern’s assets; or (2) the entire portion of the assets involved in performing the award.”  Small Business Innovation Research Program and 
Small Business Technology Transfer Program Policy Directive, 85 Fed. Reg. 50062, 50063 (Aug., 17, 2020) .  However, we note that this language does not appear in the 
current version of the SBIR/STTR policy directive.   In fact, the SBIR/STTR policy 
directive does not provide a definition of, or any examples of what qualifies as, a successor -in-interest entity.  See SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) §  6(a)(5).    
12 A full copy of the asset purchase agreement is included as part of the record.  AR, 
Tab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216.  Page 17     B-423319   Relevant here, the asset purchase agreement refer red to Clear Align as “Buyer,” 
Computer Optics as “Seller,” and stated  that “Seller . . . owns and operates a high- tech 
optics business  (the ‘Business ’).”  Id. at 109.  The asset purchase agreement stated  that 
“Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Buy er, substantially 
all of the assets of Seller relating to the Business, and Buyer intends to thereafter 
operate the Business as a division of Buyer (the ‘ Computer Optics Division ’).”  Id.  The 
asset purchase agreement further stated  that:  
 
Seller shall sell and assign to Buyer, and buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller, free and clear . . . the following assets[]:  
 
* * * * * 
 all intellectual property used or usable in connection with the Business, including, without limitation, patents, computer software and data, trademarks, trade styles, trade secrets, know -how, processes, formulae, 
designs, drawings, technical data, domain names, websites, and the names “Computer Optics, Inc.”, “Computer Optics”, “IR Zoom”, and “Hudson Machine” (and any variations thereof).  
 
Id. at 109-110 (section 1.1).  
 In its SBIR phase III D&F, the Air Force recognized the “key SBIR -derived component 
included in Clear Align’s proposed [increment 1 TSS] is the Z 320 [MWIR] camera[.]”  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  2.  The Air Force also recognized the relevant SBIR 
phase II awards were performed by Computer Optics.  Id. at 2-3.  Based on its review of 
the above referenced asset purchase agreement, the Air Force concluded that Clear Align was properly considered a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics  
because Clear Align had acquired the assets of Computer Optics, to include all of 
Computer Optics’ intellectual property , and that Clear Align was eligible for an  SBIR 
phase III award based on the prior SBIR efforts completed by Computer Optics.  Id.  
at 2-4. 
 Digital Force challenges the agency’s conclusion that Clear Align is an eligible SBIR phase III awardee under a successor -in-interest theory.  Comments at 16- 21.  The 
protester raises multiple challenges in this regard but the gravamen is that Clear Align’s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the record do not sufficiently establish that Clear Align acquired Computer Optics or the relevant SBIR phase II awards.  See id.   For example, Digital Force argues that Computer Optics still exists as 
a discrete business concern and therefore Clear Align could not have acquired Computer Optics .  Id. at 17.  As another exam ple, Digital Force contends that the asset 
purchase agreement does not clearly define what intellectual property was conveyed 
from Computer Optics to Clear Align in the 2013 transaction because the agreement 
stated that Clear Align acquired intellectual property used in connection with “the Business” but did not specify which business .  Id.  
  Page 18     B-423319   The Air Force argues that the record supports its conclusion that Clear Align is a 
successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of SBIR phase III 
eligibility.  Supp. COS at  2-4.  The agency argues that the record shows Computer 
Optics “n o longer exists as a separate entity, but began operating as a division under 
Clear Align upon completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement. ”  Id. at 3.  The agency 
further argues that Clear Align acquired substantially all of Computer Optics’ assets relatin g to “the Business ,” which include d all of Computer Optics’ intellectual property.  
Id. at 3-4.  The agency maintains that it properly reviewed and relied upon the asset 
purchase agreement  executed between Clear Align and Computer Optics, and 
reasonably concluded that based on that agreement, Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of the instant SBIR 
phase III solicitation.  Id. at 4.  
 Based on our review of the record, we agree with the Air Force.  We find no basis to question the agency’s conclusion that Clear Align is a proper successor -in-interest entity 
to Computer Optics.  Here, the agency reasonably relied on Clear Align’s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the proposal to find that Clear Align had 
acquired Computer Optics .  The proposal states that Clear Align acquired Computer 
Optics on March 26, 2013, and that as part of this acquisition, Clear Align acquired all of Computer Optics’ intellectual property.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  This 
assertion is supported by the contents of the asset purchase agreement.  See id. 
at 109-110; see also AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216 (complete copy of the 
asset purchase agreement).   
 While Digital Force disagrees that the agency properly recognized Clear Align as a 
successor -in-interest  entity , it has not demonstrated that the agency acted 
unreasonably.  Other than challenging the legal sufficiency of the asset purchase 
agreement, Digital Force provides no support for its contention that Computer Optics 
still exists as a discrete business concern or why this would disqualify Clear Align as a successor -in-interest even if it did.   See e.g. , Comments at  17, 20; Resp. to Supp. 
Briefing at  5-7.   
 To the extent Digital Force contends that the asset purchase agreement did not specify from which business or intellectual property would be acquired, the protester attempts to 
introduce ambiguity where there is none.  Id.  at 7-10.  The asset purchase agreement 
defined Computer Optics’ “ high- tech optics business ” as “the Business.”  T here is no 
other business referenced in the agreement or reason to believe that this definition did not encompass all of Computer Optics’ business.   Further, as detailed above, the asset 
purchase agreement stated that the “Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller . . . 
all intellectual property used or usable in connection with the Business[.]”  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at 109- 110.  Given that the asset agreement defined only one 
“Business,” we have no reason to believe that  “all intellectual property” did not include 
Computer Optic’s intellectual property resulting from the prior SBIR efforts.  
 In sum, in  accordance with the SBIR/STTR policy directive, we find that the Air Force 
properly issued the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS to Clear Align as  Page 19     B-423319   the successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics.  SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 
2023) § 6(a)(5).  While Digital Force contests the Air Force’s conclusion that the asset 
purchase agreement demonstrate d Clear Align’s acquisition of Computer Optics, the 
protester has not established that the agency’s conclusion was erroneous or otherwise 
contrary to relevant law or regulation.  Absent such a clear showing, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.   The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging the issuance of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) 
program phase III solicitation for a sole- source contract  is denied where the record 
demonstrates that the agency is procuring work from a successor -in-interest entity that 
derives from, extends, or completes efforts of an acquired entity  performed under prior 
SBIR contracts . 
DECISION  
 Digital Force Technologies, Inc. (Digital Force), of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of Small Business Innovation Research p rogram ( SBIR) phase III sole -source 
solicitation  No. FA2381- 25-R- B004,  to Clear Align , LLC, of Nashua, New Hampshire, by 
the Department of the Air Force.  Digital Force contends that the SBIR phase III 
solicitation  was improper ly issued to Clear Align and that the agency is required to issue 
a competitive solicitation for its requirement.    
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small business concerns in federally funded research or research and development (R/R&D).  See  SBIR 
Program Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. § 638 (the “SBIR statute”).  Pursuant to this authority, 
certain federal agencies are required to provide a program under which a portion of the DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release without redactions. 
 
  Page 2     B-423319   agency’s  R/R&D effort is reserved for award to small business concerns.  See generally  
id.   
 
The SBIR program has three phases.  Under phase I, firms competitively apply for an award to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of a concept.  15 U.S.C. § 638(e)(4)(A).  If this is successful, a firm may be invited to appl y for a phase 
II award to further develop the concept.  Id. § 638(e)(4)(B).  A phase III award is defined 
as work that “derives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program.”  Id. § 638(e)(4)(C).  Under thi s phase, firms are 
expected to obtain funding from non- SBIR government sources or the private sector to 
develop the concept into a product for sale in private sector or military markets.  
 This protest involves the agency’s requirement for a tactical security system (TSS).  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 2.  Put simply, a TSS is a security and 
surveillance system.  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, July 2023 Requirements 
Document at  2.  Specifically, t he agency’s requirement is for an “increment 1” TSS 
which is described as a “modular, scalable, tailorable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground- based security and surveillance system.”   Id.; AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.    
 The contemplated TSS will provide ground- based tactical security and surveillance 
capability to assist security forces defenders in protecting personnel and mission assets at remote deployment locations.  AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.  The TSS will provi de 
“site situational awareness” through a network including motion detection, video assessment, and other sensing technologies integrated with command and control capability and connectivity to patrolling defenders.  Id.  Key requirements for the 
increment  1 TSS involve minimum coverage range, radar coverage, image assessment 
sensors, ability to operate in high winds, and a maximum weight.  COS at  2.   
 By way of background, in September of 2023, the agency sought to procure a different  
TSS, called increment  0.  COS at 3.  Based on its market research, the agency 
determined that Digital Force offered an “ increment  0” TSS, and on September 29, 
2023, the agency awarded Digital Force a sole- source contract for the increment  0 TSS.  
Id. at 3-4. 
 Also in September of 2023, the agency published a request for information (RFI) for the instant requirement, the increment  1 TSS.  Id. at 4.  Fourteen vendors responded, 
including Digital Force and Anduril Industries (Anduril).
1  Id. at 5.  Clear Align did not 
respond to this  RFI.  Id.   
 Over the next several months, the Air Force continued its  market research for the 
increment 1 TSS requirement .  On January  18, 2024, the agency published a second 
RFI on SAM.gov, the governmentwide point of entry  (GPE) .  Id.  Ten  vendors 
responded, including Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align.  Id.  at 5-8.  Additionally, the 
 
1 As discussed later in this decision, Anduril  (of Costa Mesa, California) is relevant to 
the procurement history .  Anduril is not a party to this protest.      Page 3     B-423319   agency published the same RFI to the General Services Administration (GSA) website.  
Id. at 7.  Four vendors responded to the RFI posted on GSA’s website, none of which 
were Digital Force, Anduril, or Clear Align .  Id.  The agency also directly contacted 
interested vendors via  email to share its systems requirement document (SRD) with 
those vendors and to solicit responses.  Id.  at 9.  
 Relevant here, the Air Force directly contacted Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align about  the increment 1 TSS requirement and provided them with the agency’s SRD .  Id. 
at 9-11.  Each of these firms responded to the inquiry.  Id.   The agency  also provided 
another RFI  to 16 small businesses  that had expressed interest in the increment 1 
acquisition.  Id.  at 11.  Clear Align, a small business concern, received this RFI.  Id.  
at 11-12. 
 Over the course of conducting its market research, the agency learned information which suggested that both Clear Align and Anduril could be eligible to receive an  SBIR 
phase III award for the increment 1 TSS.  Id. at 6, 12.   On August  20, 2024, the agency 
decided to fulfill the increment 1 TSS requirement via  an SBIR phase  III award , rather 
than pursuing a competitive procurement such as a competition under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.  Id. at 17.  T he agency then issued two sole- source 
SBIR pha se III solicitations  for the  same increment 1 TSS  requirement ; one to Clear 
Align and one to Anduril.  Id.    
 On September 3, Digital Force learned that the agency  would pursue its increment 1 
TSS requirement  via an SBIR phase III award.  Id. at 21.  Ten days later, Digital Force 
filed an agency -level protest challenging the agency’s decision to pursue an  SBIR 
phase III award  rather than conducting a competition for the TSS requirement .
2  Id. 
at 22; AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  11-20.   
 
The protester argued that the Air Force’s  increment  1 TSS requirement was not eligible 
to be awarded through a sole-source SBIR p hase III solicitation because it did not 
derive from, extend, or complete efforts from a previous SBIR award,  as (according to 
the protester) the requirement did not include original concepts, findings, ideas, or 
research results generated by a previous SBIR effort.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level 
Protest at  14-15.  Further, t he protester claimed  that the agency’s use of SBIR authority 
was inappropriate because the requirement was for existing capabilities available from Digital Force and the commercial marketplace, and therefore the requirement should be competed.  Id. at 15.  According to Digital Force, SBIR phase III authority was not 
intended to apply to a scenario (like here)  where competing technologies are available 
 
2 Digital Force also argued that the Air Force improperly failed to publish a notification of 
its sole -source justification to the GPE.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  18-19.  
The agency denied this protest ground, finding that it was not required  to publish to the 
GPE a justification and approval document for actions related to an  SBIR phase  III 
award.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at  6-7.  This protest ground is not 
included in the instant protest and therefore we do not address it further.   Page 4     B-423319   to meet the agency’s need.  Id. at 17.  On September 23, the Air Force denied the 
agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at 7.  
 
On October 3, Digital Force filed a protest with our Office, challenging the SBIR phase III solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril for the increment 1 TSS.  COS 
at 23.  In that protest, Digital Force challenged the Air Force’s authority to procure the 
increment 1 TSS via  an SBIR phase  III award rather than a competitive acquisition.   AR, 
Tab 23, First GAO Protest at  18-27.  In response, the Air Force filed a notice of 
corrective action, stating that the agency would cancel the solicitations issued to Clear 
Align and Anduril, and issue a new solicitation that “more clearly addresses competition issues and best meets the needs of the Air Force.”  AR, Tab 26, Notice of Corrective Action at  2.  On November 21, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Digital 
Force Techs., Inc. , B-423029, Nov.  21, 2024 (unpublished decision).  
 As part of its corrective action, the Air Force canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril.  COS at  24.  The Air Force concluded that issuing a single SBIR 
phase III solicitation to Clear Align for the increment 1 TSS would address the identified 
competition concerns, as “there would not be any further confusion associated with the release of simultaneous sole source SBIR Phase III solicitations[.]”   Id. at 25.  On 
December 9, the Air Force decided to pursue the increment 1 TSS requirement via  a 
single SBIR phase  III solicitation issued to Clear Ali gn.  Id.  On December 20, Clear 
Align submitted its proposal.  Id.  at 25- 26.   
 On January 22, 2025, Digital Force requested a status update on the corrective action.  AR, Tab 36, Email from Digital Force to Agency, Jan. 22, 2025.  In response, the Air 
Force stated that it had canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril, reassessed its market research, and decided to issue a single SBIR phase III 
solicitation for the increment 1 TSS requirement.  Id. , Email from Agency to Digital 
Force, Jan. 27, 2025.  The agency subsequently confirmed that the new solicitation had 
been issued to Clear Align .  Id., Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 30, 2025.  The 
agency further stated that  Clear Align’s proposed solution derives from, extends, and 
completes work from two prior SBIR phase II awards ; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 
and contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069.   Id.  The record reflects that no award has been 
made.   AR, Tab 36, Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 27, 2025; Memorandum of 
Law ( MOL ) at 6.  On February 6, Digital Force filed the instant protest with our Office.  
 DISCUSSION  Digital Force challenges the Air F orce’s issuance of  an SBIR phase  III solicitation  to 
Clear Align , arguing that  the agency’s requirement for an increment 1 TSS does not 
derive from, extend, or complete the relevant  SBIR phase  II efforts .  The protester 
further argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an SBIR phase III award because the relevant SBIR phase II contracts were awarded to a firm called Computer 
Optics, not Clear Align , and Clear Align does not qualify as a successor -in-interest  entity  
to Computer Optics .  As relief, Digital Force requests the Air Force rescind the SBIR 
phase III solicitation and issue a competitive solicitation under which Digital Force can  Page 5     B-423319   compete.   The Air Force defends its procurement on all grounds.  As discussed below, 
we deny the protest.3  
 
Contracting agencies have broad discretion to determine their needs and the best way 
to meet them.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. , B-402530, B -402530.2, May 17, 
2010, 2010 CPD ¶  117 at 3.  We have recognized this discretion with respect to the 
SBIR program, and in reviewing the propriety of a phase I or II SBIR award, we have found that our review is limited to determining whether the agency violated any applicable regulations or solicitation provisions or acted in bad faith.  Wang Electro- Opto 
Corp. , B-418523, June 4, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 187 at 5; U S Positioning Grp., LLC , 
B-294027, June 21, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 133 at 3.   
 With respect to SBIR phase III,  the SBIR statute and policy guidance provide relatively 
limited requirements to justify an award.   The relevant portion of the statute states that 
the SBIR program will include, “where appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program in which commercial applications of SBIR -funded research or research 
and development are funded by non- Federal sources of capital or, for products or 
services intended for use by the Federal Government, by follow -on non- SBIR Federal 
funding awards[.]”  15 U.S.C. §  638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that “[t]o the 
greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that  developed the technology.  Id.  § (r)(4).    
 The policy directive  defines SBIR phase III work in a similar manner .  SBIR/Small 
business Technology Transfer (STTR)  Policy Directive ( May 2023)  § 4(c)  (“Phase III 
refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR/STTR Funding Agreements”).   The policy directive clarifies that a federal agency 
may enter an  SBIR phase III agreement at any time with an  SBIR phase II awardee and 
explains that an  SBIR phase III awardee may be a party that  received an  SBIR phase I 
or phase II award, been novated a phase I or phase II award, or is  a 
successor -in-interest entity.  Id. 
 Given these limited requirements and the significant discretion afforded to agencies in this area, the core issue s we must resolve are whether the Air Force reasonabl y 
concluded that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS derives from, extend s, or complet es 
efforts made under prior SBIR awards  and whether Clear Align qualifies as a successor 
in interest entity to Computer Optics, which completed the prior SBIR efforts .  As 
discussed below, we deny the protest.  
 
 
3 Digital Force raises other collateral arguments.  Although our decision does not 
address each argument raised, we have reviewed them all and find that none provide a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6     B-423319   Eligibility for  an SBIR Phase III Award  
 
The protester first contends that the relevant authority requires the agency to define its 
SBIR phase III requirement to derive from, extend, or complete prior SBI R effort s and 
that here, the Air Force’s requirement as described in the solicitation and market research documents does not derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  Second, Digital Force contends that Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS  is 
ineligible for an SBIR phase III award because it allegedly does not derive from, extend, 
or complete a prior SBIR effort .   
  
 Challenge to the Agency’s Requirement   
 As stated above, the protester argues the agency’s requirement must derive from, 
extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts , and that just because a proposed solution may 
derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort, that does not mean the requirements qualify for a SBIR phase III acquisition.  Protest at  22-25; Comments at  4.  
In this context, the protester  asserts that the solicitation states  general requirements for 
an increment 1 TSS solution that were developed separately from and without reference to prior SBIR efforts.  Protest  at 24.  As a result, Digital Force maintains that the 
requirements themselves do not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  In other words, Digital Force  contends that the requirement as described by the 
agency --as opposed to the solution proposed by Clear Align--must show that it derives 
from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort.  
 The Air Force disagrees.   As an initial note, the agency does not contest the protester’s 
contention that its requirement does not derive from a prior SBIR effort.   However, the 
agency  asserts  the protester incorrectly focus es the analysis on the agency’s 
requirements rather than on the work to be acquired.  COS at  28; MOL at 14.   The Air 
Force argues that the SBIR statute and the SBIR/STTR policy directive  require SBIR 
phase III awards to be for work  that derives from, extends, or completes  prior SBIR 
efforts, not for requirements  that derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  
MOL at  14; see 15 U.S.C. §  638 (e)(4)(C)  (phase III is “for work that derives from, 
extends, or completes efforts[.]” ); SBIR/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023)  § 4(c) 
(“Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort”).   As 
discussed below, we agree with the Air Force.  
 Our analysis begins with the interpretation of the relevant statute.  See Curtin Mar. Corp. , B-417175.2, Mar. 29, 2019, 2019 CPD ¶ 117 at 9.  In construing the statute, t he 
first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.   PublicRelay , B-421154, 
B-421154.2, Jan.  17, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶  23 at  5.  In this regard, we begin with the 
language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that langu age accurately expresses the legislative purpose.   Id.  If the statutory language is 
clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.  Id.  Our Office 
likewise applies the “plain meaning” rule of statutory interpretation.  Id. 
  Page 7     B-423319   The SBIR statute explains that the SBIR program includes a phased structure including: 
“where appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes 
efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program .”  15 U.S.C. 
§ 638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that “[t]o the greatest extent practicable, 
Federal agencies . . . shall . . . consider an award under the SBIR program . . . to satisfy 
[relevant competition requirements]; and . . . issue, without further justificat ion, Phase III 
awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that developed the technology.”  Id. § (r)(4).  
 While not a regulation, t he SBIR/STTR policy directive provides interpretive guidance 
and states in relevant part : 
 
(c) Phase III. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR/STTR Funding Agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR/STTR programs.  Phase III 
work is typically oriented towards C ommercialization of SBIR/STTR 
research or technology, including through further R/R&D work.    
 
(1) Phase III work:   Each of the following types of activity 
constitutes SBIR/STTR Phase III work:  
 
(i) Commercial application . . . of SBIR/STTR funded 
R/R&D that is financed by non- Federal sources of 
capital. . . .    
 
(ii) SBIR/STTR- derived products or services intended 
for use by the Federal Government, funded by non-
SBIR/STTR sources of Federal funding.    
 
(iii) Continuation of SBIR/STTR work, funded by non-SBIR/STTR sources of Federal funding including R/R&D.   
 SBIR/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) § 4(c) .  Further, the policy directive states that 
“[p]hase III work may be for products, production, services, R/R&D, or any such combination.”  Id. § 4(c)(4).  
 Based on the authority and guidance cited above, we find that SBIR phase III  
unambiguously refers to  the work to be acquired,  not the agency’s requirement.  Indeed, 
the statute and the policy directive each expressly use the word “work” when explaining SBIR phase III ; they do not mention the agency’s requirement.  15 U.S.C. 
§ 638(e)(4)(C); SBIR/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) § 4(c).  Therefore, we agree 
with the Air Force’s interpretation of the SBIR phase III authority ; a proper SBIR phase  Page 8     B-423319   III award is for work  that derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .4  
Accordingly, we deny the protest ground arguing that the Air Force improperly issued an  
SBIR phase III solicitation to Clear Align because the agency’s requirement  does not 
derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  Digital Force’s protest ground 
misapplies  the relevant law and policy directive and therefore does not provide a basis 
to sustain the protest.5  
 
 Challenge to the Work to be Procured:  Clear Align’s Proposed Increment 1 TSS   
 Digital Force argues that the Air Force has not properly determined that  Clear Align’s 
proposed increment 1 TSS in fact derives from, extends, or completes the prior relevant 
SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32- 38.  First, the protester  
argues that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS does not qualify for  an SBIR phase III award 
because the record does not demonstrate the required link between the prior SBIR efforts and the proposed increment 1 TSS.  Protest at  28-29; Comments at  24-29.  In 
support of this argument, t he protester asserts that the Air Force did not  review the prior 
SBIR phase II efforts  to understand what was developed, nor did  the Air Force review 
the proposed increment 1 TSS to ensure it derived from, extended, or completed those SBIR phase II efforts.  Comments at  21-29.  Second, Digital Force argues that the Air 
Force is improperly using SBIR phase III authority because only a single component of 
the system to be acquired could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant 
prior SBIR efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  Prior to discussing the 
arguments, for context, we provide a brief explanation o f the solicitation and Clear 
Align’s  proposed increment 1 TSS.   
 
 
4 We note that Digital Force recognizes this distinction in other areas of its pleadings.  
See e.g. , Comments at 21 (“The Air Force does not dispute that . . . the acquisition must 
involve ‘work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts’”) . 
5 The protester’s focus on the agency’s requirements, as opposed to Clear Align’s work, 
may be a distinction without a difference.  In this regard, an agency’s requirements are 
not necessarily irrelevant to the determination of whether a procurement can properly be awarded as a n SBIR phase III.  Indeed, in some cases we have analyzed the 
agency’s requirements in SBIR p hase III  matters .  See, e.g. , Toyon Research 
Corporation, B -409765, Aug. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶  235 ( Toyon) ; PublicRelay , supra.  In 
those cases, the protester s argued that the agency’s requirements actually required the 
award of SBIR phase III agreements  on sole- source bases to the respective protester , 
and therefore we necessarily focused our analysis on the agency’s requirements.  
However, as explained above, the statute and policy directive clearly state that SBIR phase III refers to the work that will be performed.  Therefore, while an agency’s 
requirements may be relevant to the analysis of whether a procurement constitutes an  
SBIR phase III procurement , the requirements themselves do not need to derive from, 
extend, or complete a prior phase I or II effort in order for an agency to properly use SBIR phase III.   Page 9     B-423319   As noted above, the agency issued a solicitation to Clear Align requesting a proposal to 
deliver the TSS, “which shall contain SBIR -derived technology.”  AR, Tab 34, 
Solicitation at 5.  The solicitation instructed Clear Align to submit three volumes.   Id.  As 
relevant here, the third volume had to contain “all information regarding Clear Align’s SBIR- derived technology in its [] -TSS solution.”  Id. at 8.  This volume had to identify the 
SBIR- derived components and relevant SBIR awards, explain how the ident ified 
components derived from the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards, and include any test or production documentation associated with the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards.  Id.  
 In its proposal, Clear Align  stated that it s proposed increment 1 TSS system is called 
the Mamba.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Clear Align describe d the Mamba 
as a “ turnkey ” solution meet ing all of the Air Force’s operational and technical 
requirements  as described in the SRD  and statement of work .  Id.  The Mamba includes 
an image assessment sensor on a pan tilt unit  based on Clear Align’s Z 320 medium 
wave infrared (MWIR) camera.  Id.  According to Clear Align, t he Z 320 MWIR camera 
implements technology from two prior SBIR efforts, SBIR topic No.  N-01-016 and SBIR 
topic No.  AF071- 280, resulting in contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. 
FA9453- 08-C0069, respectively .
6  Id. at 103-104; see also COS at  31. 
 Under SBIR topic No. N01 -016, Clear Align developed optical fabrication processes for 
infrared materials  (specifically , germanium ).  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  104.  
Under this topic, optical polishing techniques were developed which enabled accurate polishing of large optical components.  Id.  Clear Align a lso developed optical coating 
removal processes, and optical coatings with increased optical efficiency and durability.  
Id.   
 Under SBIR topic No. AF071- 280, Clear Align designed a broadband image optic using 
a high performance opto- mechanism design to receive information using a multi -band 
sensor.  Id.  at 105.  Under this topic, engineering principles and designs were 
developed to allow smaller and more cost -effective optical systems to be designed and 
built which would maintain imaging performance over a wide temperature range.  Id.  
 Clear Align’s proposal stated  that following its prior SBIR efforts, it continued to invest in 
zoom lens design and fabrication methods to further advance zoom lens technology to create higher -performance infrared zoom cameras.  Id. at 107.  Clear Align explained 
that its current generation of zoom cameras  are high- definition systems that use small 
pixel pitch technology to offer  image clarity and range performance.  Id.  The firm further 
state d that key design concepts from the prior SBIR efforts have been refined and are 
embedded into its current generation of cameras.  Id. at 107. 
 
 
6 There is no dispute that the prior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics, 
not Clear Align.  However, for simplicity and because Clear Align was issued the solicitation as a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, our discussion in this 
area references the prior SBIR efforts as completed by Clear Align.    Page 10     B-423319   Digital Force argues  that Clear Align’s proposed TSS solution does not qualify for  an 
SBIR phase III award because it does not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR 
effort  and that the record does not support the Air Force’s  conclusion that an  SBIR 
phase III award is proper .  As previously noted, the Air Force issued the instant SBIR 
phase III solicitation to Clear Align based on two prior SBIR phase II efforts completed 
by a firm called Computer Optics, under a theory that Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Co mputer Optics.  COS at 31 -34.   
 Digital Force argues the record does not support a conclusion that the Air Force reviewed the relevant SBIR phase II efforts before determining that Clear Align’s proposed SBIR phase III increment 1 TSS derived from, extended, or completed those prior SBIR efforts.  Comments at  21-24.  Rather, Digital Force contends that the agency 
simply accepted--without any scrutiny --Clear Align’s explanation in its proposal that its 
increment 1 TSS solution derives from, extends, or completes work from its prior SBIR efforts.   
 Digital Force  also argues that the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III to 
acquire a system where only a single component of the system could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant prior SBIR efforts --the Z 320 MWIR camera.  
Protest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  The protester argues that even if the Z 320 
MWIR camera qualifies  as deriving from a prior SBIR effort (which it contests) , the Air 
Force cannot properly use SBIR phase III authority to procure its entire TSS s ystem  
where the only component of the system deriving from the SBIR program might be the 
Z 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 32.  
 
In raising  this challenge,  Digital Force contends  that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS  is 
not an  SBIR- derived produc t because it  consists of several  discrete components, many 
of which are commercially available off -the-shelf (COTS) items  available from multiple 
sources , and that the only components provided by  Clear Align itself are the Z 320 
MWIR camera and an electro- optic camera.  Id.  at 32-33.  For example, Digital Force 
highlights  Clear Align ’s proposed use of  COTS components  in its overall system  
includ ing a ruggedized laptop, a ruggedized tablet, radios, cables, ancillary equipment, 
and a lift mast.  Id.  at 33.    
 According to the protester, here, the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III authority to procure work ( i.e., the COTS items included in the TSS) which does not 
derive from, extend, or complete the prior SBIR effort.  Id.  at 34.  As a hypothetical 
example to illustrate its point, Digital Force argues that under the Air Force’s interpretation of the SBIR statute, a large defense contractor could purchase the rights to Clear Align’s Z 320 MWIR camera, install the camera on a  C-40 aircraft, and win an  
SBIR phase III award for the Air Force’s C -40 fleet expansion program.  Id. at 36-37 
n.115.    
 The Air Force defends its procurement.   MOL at 17- 21.  According to the agency, the 
record clearly demonstrates that the SBIR phase III solicitation was properly issued to  Page 11     B-423319   Clear Align for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts.  Id. 
at 18.   
 The Air Force notes that the SBIR statue describes the SBIR program as including a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts, but argues that the statute does not “define or explain” the meaning of that language.  Id.  
at 18.  Based on the statutory language, t he Air Force asserts  that procuring agencies 
have broad discretion to assess how an underlying SBIR effort is “essential to the goal of a SBIR Phase III contract [,]” and that, contrary to the protest ground, nothi ng in the 
relevant authority suggests that “an entire solution or set of requirements must be wholly derived from the underlying effort. ”  Id. at 20.  Furthermore, the Air Force argues 
that the record contains sufficient documentation explaining how Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS was considered and how it was determined that SBIR phase III authority properly  applies to the instant procurement.  Id.  at 21.  As discussed below, we 
find no basis to sustain the protest.  
 With respect to an  SBIR phase III award, our Office has previously found that to show 
one effort derives from, extends, or completes another, “it must be evident that the requirements for the second effort incorporated original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results  that were generated in the first.”  ASRC Federal Data Network 
Technologies, LLC , B-418765, Aug.  28, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  339 at  6 (citing  Toyon at 16 
n.15; see also PublicRelay , supra at 9 n.7.   As discussed more below, we find that the 
“original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results” language is not , however,  the 
appropriate test for the instant protest given its posture.   That is, here, we are examining 
whether proposed work derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts; we are 
not examining whether the agency’s  stated requirement derives from prior SBIR efforts.  
 Relying on the language in Toyon and PublicRelay , Digital Force argues that this 
procurement does not qualify for  SBIR phase III because the agency’s requirement 
does  not incorporate original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were 
generated in Clear Align’s prior SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at 23- 27; Comments 
at 30-32.  However, as explained above, SBIR phase III refers to work that derives from, 
extends, or completes efforts performed under prior SBIR phase I or II awards.  An agency’ s requirements are not dispositive as to whether a procurement can utilize  SBIR 
phase III.   
 Moreover, in Toyon and PublicRelay , our Office was analyzing protests arguing that  the 
agency was required to award SBIR phase III agreements to the respective protesters . 
The protesters  argued that they should have received sole- source awards because the 
agency  sought contractors to perform requirements that the protesters argued were 
derived from the work the protesters had completed under prior SBIR efforts , or that the 
agency was requiring the contractor s to extend or complete the work they had 
previously done.  Accordingly, our focus was on whether the government ’s 
requirements  were based on work previously done by the protesters .   
  Page 12     B-423319   In contrast, here,  the agency  is making a sole- source award to Clear Align  for its  
proposed TSS solution , which is based on work Clear  Align has proposed in order  to 
meet the agency’s operational requirement .  In this context, t he relevant  question is 
whether that proposed solution derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed 
under the relevant  SBIR phase II awards.   Accordingly, we do not agree with the 
protester  that the litmus test for determining whether this solicitation  is properly issued 
using SBIR phase III is whether the agency’s requirements incorporate original 
concepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were generated in prior SBIR phase I 
or II efforts.7   
 In this posture,  and given the broad language used by the SBIR statute and the 
SBIR/STTR policy directive  to describe SBIR phase III and the lack of  a precise 
explanation as to what qualifies as work der iving from , extending , or complet ing a prior 
SBIR effort , we will review the record to determine whether the agency reasonably 
concluded that this procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III in a manner that is 
consistent with all applicable laws  and regulations.
8  
 As detailed above, the instant solicitation was issued to Clear Align following several months of market research.  The contracting officer explains that in determining whether 
SBIR phase III authority could be used for the instant procurement, the agency  
concluded that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS constituted work deriving from two prior 
SBIR- funded efforts; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. 
FA9453- 08-C-0069.   COS at  28.  As part of this analysis, the agency prepared an SBIR 
phase III determi nation and findings (D&F) , and a commercial item D&F, on Clear 
Align’s increment 1 TSS.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F; AR, Tab 32 Commercial 
Item D&F.  
 
In the SBIR phase III D&F, the agency concluded that Clear Align’s TSS derives from prior SBIR efforts and that Clear Align is therefore eligible for a sole- source contract 
 
7 Moreover, we clarify that the test in Toyon represented one potential approach to 
determine whether a procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III when analyzing an 
agency’s requirements .  That is, whether those requirements incorporate original 
concepts, findings, ideas, or research results.  We think such an approach provides a 
reasonable assessment of whether the agency intends to procure a solution from contractors that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR phase I or II efforts 
based on a review of the agency’s requirements.  Here, the analysis is focused on whether the agency reasonably concluded that Clear Align’s proposed work --the 
TSS--derived from, extended, or completed efforts performed under prior SBIR awards.  
8 We note that the SBIR/STTR policy directive provides three “types of activit [ies]” that 
constitute SBIR phase III work , but no precise explanation.  SBIR/STTR Policy Directive 
(May 2023) §§ 4(c)(1)(i)- (iii).  For example, the policy directive lists as a type of activity 
constituting SBIR/STTR phase III work, “SBIR/STTR- derived products or services 
intended for  use by the Federal Government, funded by non- SBIR/STTR sources of 
Federal funding.” Id.  § (4)(c)(1)(ii).   Page 13     B-423319   pursuant to 15 U.S.C. section 638(r)(4) .  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  4; see 15 
U.S.C. §  638(r)(4)  (stating that to the greatest extent practicable, federal agencies shall 
issue, without further justification, phase III awards relating to technology, including 
sole-source awards, to the SBIR award recipient that developed the technology).   
Included as attachments in the SBIR phase III D&F a re copies of the prior SBIR efforts 
performed by Computer Optics , the firm subsequently acquired by Clear Align .  AR, 
Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 
(contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404).          
 The SBIR phase III D&F memorialized the agency’s consideration of the relevant SBIR phase II efforts and explained their relevance to the instant procurement.  Id. at 2-4.  
First, the D&F explained that work performed under contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069 
facilitated the development of engineering principles and designs that enabled a smaller and more cost -effective Z 320 MWIR camera system that will be provided in Clear 
Align’s TSS.  Id.  at 2-3, 220.   Second, the D&F explained that contract 
No. N68335- 02-C-0404 resulted in three developments which were incorporated into 
Clear Align’s TSS:  accurate polishing of infrared materials, enhanced durability of optical anti -reflection infrared coatings, and optical fabrication of infrared components 
with challenging geometries and high levels of curvature.   Id. at 4.  The agency 
ultimately concluded that Clear Align’s proposed TSS “directly benefits from the work performed under the two SBIR Phase II awards” because those prior SBIR efforts “enhanced the performance, manufacturability, and environmental res istance of the 
Z 320 MWIR camera[.]”  Id.  
 In the commercial item D&F, the agency determined that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS 
met the definition of a commercial product with minor modifications.  AR, Tab 32, Commercial Item D&F at  2.  In reaching this conclusion, the agency found that Clear 
Align ’s TSS was assigned commercial part number VZ320HD -3000, the TSS included 
Clear Align’s Z 320 MWIR camera,  which has been commercialized since 2023, the 
Z 320 MWIR camera used for the TSS included a minor modification to meet size and 
weight requirements established in the agency’s SRD, and that the minor modification did not alter the essential characteristics of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Id. at 2-3.  The 
agency found that the SBIR -derived component of the TSS, the Z 320 MWIR camera, 
accounted for 32 percent of the total cost per TSS unit, and that the TSS included other major components that are COTS items.  Id.  at 3-4. 
 As discussed above, Digital Force argues that the Air Force unreasonably concluded (and insufficiently documented its conclusion)  that Clear Align’s solution qualified for  an 
SBIR phase III  award.   The protester also argues  that the agency is improperly using 
SBIR phase III authority to acquire a system largely composed of COTS components 
where only a single component of the system , the Z 320 MWIR camera,  could have 
possibly derive d from, extended, or completed  the relevant prior SBIR efforts .  Protest 
at 27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32-38.  We have reviewed these challenges and find no 
basis to sustain the protest.   Based on our review of the record, we decline to disturb 
the Air Force’s conclusion that Clear Align’s increment 1 TSS derives from, extends, or  Page 14     B-423319   completes prior SBIR efforts.  The record shows that the agency reasonably concluded 
Clear Align’s proposed solution derives from work developed under prior SBIR efforts.    
 
Contrary to Digital Force’s arguments, t he record includes  sufficient evidence and 
support showing how the  Air Force reached its conclusion that the proposed increment 
1 TSS derived from a prior SBIR effort.  This includes  copies of the prior SBIR 
contracts , which list the details of the work to be completed under those contracts, a 
copy of the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS, a copy of Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS, an explanation of the SBIR -derived technology in Clear 
Align’s  proposed solution, and D&F documents evaluating the proposed increment 1 
TSS against the prior SBIR efforts.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at 1- 4 
(analysis),  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 (contract 
No. N68335- 02-C-0404); AR, Tab 34, Solicitation; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal.    
 As previously discussed, the SBIR statute and policy directive set forth very limited requirements to justify a n SBIR phase III solicitation or award.  The record here contains 
ample documentation and evidentiary support showing how the Air Force reasonably concluded that Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS derives from the relevant prior 
SBIR phase  II contracts.   
 To the extent that Digital Force criticizes the agency’s review of the prior SBIR phase II efforts or its review of Clear Align’s proposal, we find that such criticism amounts to disagreement with the agency’s judgments which does not provide a basis to sustain this protest.   See MiMoCloud , B-419482, Mar.  25, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  157 at  7.  While 
the protester may wish the agency had done more independent research or analysis by 
going outside of the contents of Clear Align’s proposal in some way, the protester cites no authority requiring such an effort.
9     
 In addition, we find no basis to sustain the protester’s argument that the agency is improperly using SBIR phase III to procure a system that is made up of COTS components and only a single component could qualify for  an SBIR phase III  award.  In 
this regard, Digital Force points to no statue, regulation, or other legal authority stating that an agency may not use SBIR phase III authority to procure a system where only a 
component of the overall system derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .  Here, the agency is procuring a security system that requires, for example, 
surveillance capability, motion detection, video assessment, and sensing technologies, and Clear Align is providing within its overall system, an  SBIR- derived camera.  AR, 
Tab 34, Solicitation at  39; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Thus, the 
SBIR- derived component is reasonably related to the overall objective of the system the 
agency seeks to procure.  Accordingly, this procurement is not similar to Digital Force’s hypot hetical example and cautionary tale involving the Air Force’s C -40 fleet expansion 
program .   
 
9 For example, Digital Force opines that the Air Force could have produced evidence 
that engineers “performed a technical analysis” of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 26.   Page 15     B-423319    
In sum, there simply is no requirement in statute or the policy directive that the entirety 
of a phase III solution must be derived from prior SBIR efforts.   As such , we find that the 
Air Force reasonably concluded Clear Align’s proposed increment 1 TSS derived from the relevant SBIR phase II efforts, and that the record sufficiently supports the agency’s conclusion.   This protest ground is denied.  
 SBIR Phase III Successor -in-Interest Entities  
 Digital Force argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an  SBIR phase III contract 
because Clear Align is not a proper successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, the 
firm that completed the prior  SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  20 n.61; Comments 
at 16-21.  In this regard, Digital Force argues that Clear  Align does not meet the 
definition of a successor -in-interest entity , as defined by the SBIR/STTR policy directive.  
Comments at  19-21.  Digital Force alleges that the record does not support a conclusion 
that Clear Align acquired Computer Optics and that Clear Align’s proposal misrepresents the merger of the relevant companies.  Id. at 16-18.  As discussed below, 
we deny the protest.
10  
 Relevant here, t he SBIR statue includes the following language:  
 
In general.  In the case of a small business concern that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR program, a Federal agency m ay enter into a Phase III agreement with that business concern 
for additional work to be performed during or after the Phase II period.  
 
* * * * * 
 To the greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients  that 
developed the technology.  
 
 
10 Digital Force also challenges the agency’s reliance on the SBIR/STTR policy 
directive’s guidance for successor -in-interest firms.  Comments at 18 -19.  According to 
the protester, the SBIR/STTR policy directive conflicts with the SBIR statute, which, accor ding to the protester, does not contemplate SBIR phase III awards to any business 
concern other than the concern that completed the prior SBIR effort.  Id. (citing 
15 U.S.C. §  638(r)(1)) ; see SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) § 6(a)(5) .  We 
dismiss this protest ground as untimely.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(2).  In the protest , Digital 
Force recognized t he relevance of  Clear Align ’s status as a successor -in-interest  entity  
to Computer Optics  but did not  challenge the SBIR/STTR policy directive’s guidance on 
success- in-interest firms as inconsistent with the SBIR statut e.  Protest at 20 n.61.  
Because the challenge appear s for the first time in Digital Force’s comments on the 
agency report, it is untimely.   4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(2).   Page 16     B-423319   15 U.S.C. §§  638(r)(1), (4).  
 
In implementing the SBIR statute, the SBIR/STTR policy directive explains that:  
 
An SBIR/STTR Awardee may include, and SBIR/STTR work may be performed by, those identified via a “novated” or “successor in interest” or similarly -revised Funding Agreement.  For example, a Phase III Awardee 
may have either received a prior Phase I or Phas e II award or been 
novated a Phase I or Phase II award (or received a revised Phase I or Phase II award if a grant or cooperative grant) or be a successor -in-interest entity.  
 SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) §  6(a)(5).
11   
 As previously  discussed, the agency determined that Clear Align’s proposed 
increment  1 TSS included  work deriv ing from two prior SBIR efforts .  See AR, Tab 35, 
Clear Align Proposal at  103-104; see also COS at  31.  There is no dispute that these 
prior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics.  See AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase 
III D&F at  165 ( showing contract No. FA9453- 08-C-0069 issued to Computer Optics ); 
Id. at 221 ( showing contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 issued to Computer Optics ).  
Accordingly, the question we must answer is whether Clear Align properly qualifies as an eligible  SBIR phase III awardee on the theory that it is a successor -in-interest entity 
to Computer Optics.   
 Clear Align’s proposal explained that Clear Align acquired the assets of Computer 
Optics on March 26, 2013.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  The proposal 
state d that all “intellectual property including, without limitation, patents, computer 
software, data, trademarks, trade secrets, know -how, processes, formulae, designs, 
drawings, and technical data were assigned to Clear Align, LLC at the closing of the sale.”   Id.  Included as an attachment to the proposal wa s an excerpt of the asset 
purchase agreement entered into between Clear Align and Computer Optics.
12  Id. 
at 109-110. 
 
 
11 When the SBA updated this language regarding a successor -in-interest , it stated that 
“[a]n entity may be considered a successor -in-interest, if it has secured the transfer of: 
(1) All the small business concern’s assets; or (2) the entire portion of the assets involved in performing the award.”  Small Business Innovation Research Program and 
Small Business Technology Transfer Program Policy Directive, 85 Fed. Reg. 50062, 50063 (Aug., 17, 2020) .  However, we note that this language does not appear in the 
current version of the SBIR/STTR policy directive.   In fact, the SBIR/STTR policy 
directive does not provide a definition of, or any examples of what qualifies as, a successor -in-interest entity.  See SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) §  6(a)(5).    
12 A full copy of the asset purchase agreement is included as part of the record.  AR, 
Tab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216.  Page 17     B-423319   Relevant here, the asset purchase agreement refer red to Clear Align as “Buyer,” 
Computer Optics as “Seller,” and stated  that “Seller . . . owns and operates a high- tech 
optics business  (the ‘Business ’).”  Id. at 109.  The asset purchase agreement stated  that 
“Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Buy er, substantially 
all of the assets of Seller relating to the Business, and Buyer intends to thereafter 
operate the Business as a division of Buyer (the ‘ Computer Optics Division ’).”  Id.  The 
asset purchase agreement further stated  that:  
 
Seller shall sell and assign to Buyer, and buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller, free and clear . . . the following assets[]:  
 
* * * * * 
 all intellectual property used or usable in connection with the Business, including, without limitation, patents, computer software and data, trademarks, trade styles, trade secrets, know -how, processes, formulae, 
designs, drawings, technical data, domain names, websites, and the names “Computer Optics, Inc.”, “Computer Optics”, “IR Zoom”, and “Hudson Machine” (and any variations thereof).  
 
Id. at 109-110 (section 1.1).  
 In its SBIR phase III D&F, the Air Force recognized the “key SBIR -derived component 
included in Clear Align’s proposed [increment 1 TSS] is the Z 320 [MWIR] camera[.]”  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  2.  The Air Force also recognized the relevant SBIR 
phase II awards were performed by Computer Optics.  Id. at 2-3.  Based on its review of 
the above referenced asset purchase agreement, the Air Force concluded that Clear Align was properly considered a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics  
because Clear Align had acquired the assets of Computer Optics, to include all of 
Computer Optics’ intellectual property , and that Clear Align was eligible for an  SBIR 
phase III award based on the prior SBIR efforts completed by Computer Optics.  Id.  
at 2-4. 
 Digital Force challenges the agency’s conclusion that Clear Align is an eligible SBIR phase III awardee under a successor -in-interest theory.  Comments at 16- 21.  The 
protester raises multiple challenges in this regard but the gravamen is that Clear Align’s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the record do not sufficiently establish that Clear Align acquired Computer Optics or the relevant SBIR phase II awards.  See id.   For example, Digital Force argues that Computer Optics still exists as 
a discrete business concern and therefore Clear Align could not have acquired Computer Optics .  Id. at 17.  As another exam ple, Digital Force contends that the asset 
purchase agreement does not clearly define what intellectual property was conveyed 
from Computer Optics to Clear Align in the 2013 transaction because the agreement 
stated that Clear Align acquired intellectual property used in connection with “the Business” but did not specify which business .  Id.  
  Page 18     B-423319   The Air Force argues that the record supports its conclusion that Clear Align is a 
successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of SBIR phase III 
eligibility.  Supp. COS at  2-4.  The agency argues that the record shows Computer 
Optics “n o longer exists as a separate entity, but began operating as a division under 
Clear Align upon completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement. ”  Id. at 3.  The agency 
further argues that Clear Align acquired substantially all of Computer Optics’ assets relatin g to “the Business ,” which include d all of Computer Optics’ intellectual property.  
Id. at 3-4.  The agency maintains that it properly reviewed and relied upon the asset 
purchase agreement  executed between Clear Align and Computer Optics, and 
reasonably concluded that based on that agreement, Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of the instant SBIR 
phase III solicitation.  Id. at 4.  
 Based on our review of the record, we agree with the Air Force.  We find no basis to question the agency’s conclusion that Clear Align is a proper successor -in-interest entity 
to Computer Optics.  Here, the agency reasonably relied on Clear Align’s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the proposal to find that Clear Align had 
acquired Computer Optics .  The proposal states that Clear Align acquired Computer 
Optics on March 26, 2013, and that as part of this acquisition, Clear Align acquired all of Computer Optics’ intellectual property.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  This 
assertion is supported by the contents of the asset purchase agreement.  See id. 
at 109-110; see also AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216 (complete copy of the 
asset purchase agreement).   
 While Digital Force disagrees that the agency properly recognized Clear Align as a 
successor -in-interest  entity , it has not demonstrated that the agency acted 
unreasonably.  Other than challenging the legal sufficiency of the asset purchase 
agreement, Digital Force provides no support for its contention that Computer Optics 
still exists as a discrete business concern or why this would disqualify Clear Align as a successor -in-interest even if it did.   See e.g. , Comments at  17, 20; Resp. to Supp. 
Briefing at  5-7.   
 To the extent Digital Force contends that the asset purchase agreement did not specify from which business or intellectual property would be acquired, the protester attempts to 
introduce ambiguity where there is none.  Id.  at 7-10.  The asset purchase agreement 
defined Computer Optics’ “ high- tech optics business ” as “the Business.”  T here is no 
other business referenced in the agreement or reason to believe that this definition did not encompass all of Computer Optics’ business.   Further, as detailed above, the asset 
purchase agreement stated that the “Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller . . . 
all intellectual property used or usable in connection with the Business[.]”  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at 109- 110.  Given that the asset agreement defined only one 
“Business,” we have no reason to believe that  “all intellectual property” did not include 
Computer Optic’s intellectual property resulting from the prior SBIR efforts.  
 In sum, in  accordance with the SBIR/STTR policy directive, we find that the Air Force 
properly issued the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS to Clear Align as  Page 19     B-423319   the successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics.  SBIR/STTR Policy Directive (May 
2023) § 6(a)(5).  While Digital Force contests the Air Force’s conclusion that the asset 
purchase agreement demonstrate d Clear Align’s acquisition of Computer Optics, the 
protester has not established that the agency’s conclusion was erroneous or otherwise 
contrary to relevant law or regulation.  Absent such a clear showing, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.   The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez

DECISION  
 K&K JL Services, Inc., a small business of Concord, California, challenges the terms and conditions of request for proposals (RFP) No. FA480025R0009, issued by the Department of the Air Force for grounds maintenance at Joint Base Langley -Eustis 
(JBLE), Vir ginia.  The protester contends that the solicitation is unduly restrictive of 
competition.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 
On February 11, 2025, the Air Force issued the RFP as a total small business set -aside 
pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15.  Agency Report 
(AR), Tab  9, RFP at 1.
1  The solicitation contemplates the award of a single fixed- price 
contract for grounds maintenance at JBLE with a base period of 8 months and two 1-year option periods.  Id.  at 3-13, 73; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at  5.  
JBLE consists of more than 2,000 acres of improved, semi -improved, and airfield

  Page 2 B-423367  grounds and over 1 million linear feet of edging and similar areas that require service.  
AR, Tab 24, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at 3.  K&K is the incumbent provider of the services, currently performing under a contract awarded in May 2024.  Protest  
at 5. 
 The RFP provides for award to be made on a lowest -price, technically acceptable 
(LPTA) basis, considering the following evaluation factors:  (1) price; (2) technical; and (3) past performance.  RFP at 73.  The technical and past performance factors will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis.  Id. at 74- 75.  With respect to past 
performance, the solicitation states that offerors “shall provide at least two (2) references . . . for recent past performance of similar size and scope requirements 
as detailed” in the PWS.  Id.  at 75.  Here, the RFP defined relevant size of a past project 
as a contract “with a value of at least $1M per year.”
2  Id. 
 Past performance will be evaluated as “acceptable” if, based “on the offeror’s performance record,” the agency has “a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,” and “unacceptable” if the agency does not.  Id.  
at 74.  The solicitation provides that “an offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned” shall be determined to have a rating of unknown, which will be considered acceptable.  Id.  at 75.  
 Proposals were due by March 7, and the agency received four proposals, including one from K&K.  RFP at 1; COS at 7.  K&K filed this protest of the solicitation prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the solicitation’s past performance evaluation factor as unduly restrictive of competition.  The protester does not object to the solicitation’s definitions of relevant past performance with respect to recency (within the past five years) or scope 
(similar depth and breadth of grounds maintenance).  See  RFP at 75.  Instead, t he 
protester focuses its challenge on two issues:  (1) requiring two past performance 
references; and (2) defining relevant size as a project with a value of at least $1 million per year .  Protest at 7.  According to K&K, these requirements are unduly restrictive of 
competition because they effectively exclude a number of small businesses that are capable of the work.
3  Id. at 7-8 (“Quite simply, the past performance criteria outlined 
 
2 The RFP also defined recent performance as “occurring within the last 5 years” and 
relevant scope as a project that “involves the depth and breadth of work described in this PWS (i.e. mowing, trimming, edging, mulch, flower bed maintenance, and tractor operations to present a neat, clean, and professional appearance).”  RFP at 75.  
3 While we do not discuss every premutation of every argument raised by the protester, 
we have considered them all thoroughly and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 3 B-423367  above--the minimum number of projects and dollar value --serve no legitimate agency 
needs and unduly restrict competition.”).  
 
The determination of the government’s needs and the best method of accommodating them is primarily the responsibility of the procuring agency.  Columbia Imaging, Inc. , 
B-286772.2, B -287363, Apr. 13, 2001, 2001 CPD ¶ 78 at 2.  Our Office will not sustain a 
protest challenging an agency’s determination of its needs unless the protester presents  
clear and convincing evidence that the specifications are in fact impossible to meet or unduly restrict competition.  Instrument Control Servs ., Inc.; Science & M gmt. Res., Inc. , 
B-289660, B -289660.2, Apr. 15, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 66 at 6.  To the extent a protester 
challenges a specification as unduly restrictive, that is, challenges both the restrictive nature of the requirement as well as the agency’s need for the restriction, the procuring agency has the responsibility of establishing that the specification is reasonably necessary to meet its needs.  Smith & Nephew, Inc. , B-410453, Jan. 2, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 90 at 5.  The adequacy of the agency’s justification is ascertained through 
examining whether the agency’s explanation is reasonable,  in other words,  whether it 
can withstand logical scrutiny.   Id. 
 As an initial matter, the protester attempts to elide a fundamental element with respect to our review of solicitation requirements that are alleged to be unduly restrictive of competition.  It is true that our Office has sustained challenges to solicitati on 
requirements that restrict competition and are not reasonably related to the agency’s needs.  See, e.g. , Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-413876.2, Feb. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 56.  In 
those instances, however, the challenged solicitation requirements generally restr icted 
competition by preventing the protester from competing.  Pitney Bowes, Inc., supra.  
 Here, the protester has, in fact, submitted a proposal --in response to the current 
RFP--that identifies two past performance references for grounds maintenance work with dollar values of more than $1 million per year.  AR, Tab 38, K&K Proposal Vol. 3 at 3-5.  Although the protester asserts that “it is not sure whether the references it 
submitted will be considered relevant,” K&K’s concerns in that regard are not based on the number of past performance references required or the size of either reference.  See Comments at  3.  Accordingly, because the protester has demonstrated the ability to 
submit --and has, in fact, submitted--a proposal that met the number and size 
requirements for past performance under the RFP as written, the protester has not demonstrated competitive prejudice.  McGoldrick Constr . Servs . Corp ., B-419327,  
Jan. 15, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 53 at 12 (finding that “ because the protester clearly believed 
it was able to make a responsive offer to the RFP as written and has not argued to the contrary, the protester has not demonstrated competitive prejudice with respect to the bonding requirement ”).   
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest, and, where a prospective offeror has not shown competitive prejudice stemming from a solicitation provision, the offeror is not an interested party to challenge that provision.  See DNC Parks & Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. , B-410998, April 14, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 127 at 12- 13 
(concluding that an offeror that did not demonstrate that it was competitively prejudiced  Page 4 B-423367  by a solicitation provision was not an interested party to challenge that provision); see 
also Government & Mil . Certification Sys., Inc., B -409420, Apr. 2, 2014, 2014 CPD 
¶ 116 at 4 (concluding that a prospective offeror generally is not an interested party to 
challenge a specification as unduly restrictive in cases where it can meet requirement, because its economic interests are not prej udiced).  Here, the protester has submitted a 
proposal and has not otherwise alleged or demonstrated that it is unable to compete based on the solicitation criteria it challenges in this protest.   
 In any event , even disregarding the fact that the protester has not demonstrated 
competitive prejudice with respect to the past performance criteria, this protest ground is also substantively without merit.   Preliminarily, we note that nowhere in the solicitation 
does it provide that offerors without two relevant past performance references will be deemed ineligible for award.  RFP at 75.  To the contrary, the RFP explicitly advises:  
 
In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonable assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favor ably or unfavorably on past 
performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have “Unknown” past performance.  In the context of  
acceptability/unacceptability, “Unknown” shall be considered “Acceptable.”  
 Id.  Therefore, under this solicitation--which provides for selection on an LPTA basis --an 
offeror without a record of relevant past performance remains eligible for award.

id. at 75.  
 Furthermore, the record reflects that the contract here is expected to have a value in excess of $1 million per year.  The Air Force prepared an independent government cost 
 
4 K&K objects to the solicitation in this regard.  Comments at 5- 8.  Although K&K frames 
its objection as an issue of an ambiguity in the solicitation, it is apparent that K&K’s real objection is to the agency’s reservation of the right to consider “information available in the Contractor Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and any other sources identified by the offeror or the Government” in the evaluation of past performance.  See id.; RFP at 75.  That is, K&K asserts that, if an offeror submits past performance 
references, the agency should be limited to evaluating only those submitted references, and the agency should not be permitted to consider CPARS or other information about any contract that the offeror does not identify as a reference in its proposal.  Comments 
at 8.  There is, however, nothing inherently improper or unreasonable with the agency 
retaining the discretion to look to sources of past performance outside of those specifically submitted by the offeror, provided all offers  are evaluated on the same basis 
and the evaluation is consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Cf. J. Squared Inc. ,

DIGEST  
 Protest challenging solicitation provisions as unduly restrictive of competition is denied where the provisions are reasonably related to the agency’s requirements.  
DECISION  
 K&K JL Services, Inc., a small business of Concord, California, challenges the terms and conditions of request for proposals (RFP) No. FA480025R0009, issued by the Department of the Air Force for grounds maintenance at Joint Base Langley -Eustis 
(JBLE), Vir ginia.  The protester contends that the solicitation is unduly restrictive of 
competition.  
 We deny the protest.  
 BACKGROUND  
 
On February 11, 2025, the Air Force issued the RFP as a total small business set -aside 
pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15.  Agency Report 
(AR), Tab  9, RFP at 1.
1  The solicitation contemplates the award of a single fixed- price 
contract for grounds maintenance at JBLE with a base period of 8 months and two 1-year option periods.  Id.  at 3-13, 73; Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at  5.  
JBLE consists of more than 2,000 acres of improved, semi -improved, and airfield

  Page 2 B-423367  grounds and over 1 million linear feet of edging and similar areas that require service.  
AR, Tab 24, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at 3.  K&K is the incumbent provider of the services, currently performing under a contract awarded in May 2024.  Protest  
at 5. 
 The RFP provides for award to be made on a lowest -price, technically acceptable 
(LPTA) basis, considering the following evaluation factors:  (1) price; (2) technical; and (3) past performance.  RFP at 73.  The technical and past performance factors will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis.  Id. at 74- 75.  With respect to past 
performance, the solicitation states that offerors “shall provide at least two (2) references . . . for recent past performance of similar size and scope requirements 
as detailed” in the PWS.  Id.  at 75.  Here, the RFP defined relevant size of a past project 
as a contract “with a value of at least $1M per year.”
2  Id. 
 Past performance will be evaluated as “acceptable” if, based “on the offeror’s performance record,” the agency has “a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,” and “unacceptable” if the agency does not.  Id.  
at 74.  The solicitation provides that “an offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned” shall be determined to have a rating of unknown, which will be considered acceptable.  Id.  at 75.  
 Proposals were due by March 7, and the agency received four proposals, including one from K&K.  RFP at 1; COS at 7.  K&K filed this protest of the solicitation prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the solicitation’s past performance evaluation factor as unduly restrictive of competition.  The protester does not object to the solicitation’s definitions of relevant past performance with respect to recency (within the past five years) or scope 
(similar depth and breadth of grounds maintenance).  See  RFP at 75.  Instead, t he 
protester focuses its challenge on two issues:  (1) requiring two past performance 
references; and (2) defining relevant size as a project with a value of at least $1 million per year .  Protest at 7.  According to K&K, these requirements are unduly restrictive of 
competition because they effectively exclude a number of small businesses that are capable of the work.
3  Id. at 7-8 (“Quite simply, the past performance criteria outlined 
 
2 The RFP also defined recent performance as “occurring within the last 5 years” and 
relevant scope as a project that “involves the depth and breadth of work described in this PWS (i.e. mowing, trimming, edging, mulch, flower bed maintenance, and tractor operations to present a neat, clean, and professional appearance).”  RFP at 75.  
3 While we do not discuss every premutation of every argument raised by the protester, 
we have considered them all thoroughly and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 3 B-423367  above--the minimum number of projects and dollar value --serve no legitimate agency 
needs and unduly restrict competition.”).  
 
The determination of the government’s needs and the best method of accommodating them is primarily the responsibility of the procuring agency.  Columbia Imaging, Inc. ,

B-289660, B -289660.2, Apr. 15, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 66 at 6.  To the extent a protester 
challenges a specification as unduly restrictive, that is, challenges both the restrictive nature of the requirement as well as the agency’s need for the restriction, the procuring agency has the responsibility of establishing that the specification is reasonably necessary to meet its needs.  Smith & Nephew, Inc. , B-410453, Jan. 2, 2015, 
2015 CPD ¶ 90 at 5.  The adequacy of the agency’s justification is ascertained through 
examining whether the agency’s explanation is reasonable,  in other words,  whether it 
can withstand logical scrutiny.   Id. 
 As an initial matter, the protester attempts to elide a fundamental element with respect to our review of solicitation requirements that are alleged to be unduly restrictive of competition.  It is true that our Office has sustained challenges to solicitati on 
requirements that restrict competition and are not reasonably related to the agency’s needs.  See, e.g. , Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-413876.2, Feb. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 56.  In 
those instances, however, the challenged solicitation requirements generally restr icted 
competition by preventing the protester from competing.  Pitney Bowes, Inc., supra.  
 Here, the protester has, in fact, submitted a proposal --in response to the current 
RFP--that identifies two past performance references for grounds maintenance work with dollar values of more than $1 million per year.  AR, Tab 38, K&K Proposal Vol. 3 at 3-5.  Although the protester asserts that “it is not sure whether the references it 
submitted will be considered relevant,” K&K’s concerns in that regard are not based on the number of past performance references required or the size of either reference.  See Comments at  3.  Accordingly, because the protester has demonstrated the ability to 
submit --and has, in fact, submitted--a proposal that met the number and size 
requirements for past performance under the RFP as written, the protester has not demonstrated competitive prejudice.  McGoldrick Constr . Servs . Corp ., B-419327,  
Jan. 15, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 53 at 12 (finding that “ because the protester clearly believed 
it was able to make a responsive offer to the RFP as written and has not argued to the contrary, the protester has not demonstrated competitive prejudice with respect to the bonding requirement ”).   
 Competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest, and, where a prospective offeror has not shown competitive prejudice stemming from a solicitation provision, the offeror is not an interested party to challenge that provision.  See DNC Parks & Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. , B-410998, April 14, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 127 at 12- 13 
(concluding that an offeror that did not demonstrate that it was competitively prejudiced  Page 4 B-423367  by a solicitation provision was not an interested party to challenge that provision); see 
also Government & Mil . Certification Sys., Inc., B -409420, Apr. 2, 2014, 2014 CPD 
¶ 116 at 4 (concluding that a prospective offeror generally is not an interested party to 
challenge a specification as unduly restrictive in cases where it can meet requirement, because its economic interests are not prej udiced).  Here, the protester has submitted a 
proposal and has not otherwise alleged or demonstrated that it is unable to compete based on the solicitation criteria it challenges in this protest.   
 In any event , even disregarding the fact that the protester has not demonstrated 
competitive prejudice with respect to the past performance criteria, this protest ground is also substantively without merit.   Preliminarily, we note that nowhere in the solicitation 
does it provide that offerors without two relevant past performance references will be deemed ineligible for award.  RFP at 75.  To the contrary, the RFP explicitly advises:  
 
In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonable assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favor ably or unfavorably on past 
performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have “Unknown” past performance.  In the context of  
acceptability/unacceptability, “Unknown” shall be considered “Acceptable.”  
 Id.  Therefore, under this solicitation--which provides for selection on an LPTA basis --an 
offeror without a record of relevant past performance remains eligible for award.
4  See 
id. at 75.  
 Furthermore, the record reflects that the contract here is expected to have a value in excess of $1 million per year.  The Air Force prepared an independent government cost 
 
4 K&K objects to the solicitation in this regard.  Comments at 5- 8.  Although K&K frames 
its objection as an issue of an ambiguity in the solicitation, it is apparent that K&K’s real objection is to the agency’s reservation of the right to consider “information available in the Contractor Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and any other sources identified by the offeror or the Government” in the evaluation of past performance.  See id.; RFP at 75.  That is, K&K asserts that, if an offeror submits past performance 
references, the agency should be limited to evaluating only those submitted references, and the agency should not be permitted to consider CPARS or other information about any contract that the offeror does not identify as a reference in its proposal.  Comments 
at 8.  There is, however, nothing inherently improper or unreasonable with the agency 
retaining the discretion to look to sources of past performance outside of those specifically submitted by the offeror, provided all offers  are evaluated on the same basis 
and the evaluation is consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Cf. J. Squared Inc. ,

at 4 (discussing agency discretion to consider information beyond that submitted in a 
proposal in evaluating past performance).  As such, we find no basis to sustain K&K’s objection here.   Page 5 B-423367  estimate of approximately $[DELETED] for the overall potential 2- year and 8- month 
period of performance being competed under this solicitation.  COS at 4.  This is 
consistent with the protester’s incumbent contract for this work, which has a base- year

references with a yearly value over $1 million are reasonably related to the agency’s 
requirements here.  Cf. WILLCOR Inc. , B-422358, May 22, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 122

DECISION  
 Catalyst Solutions, LLC  (Catalyst), a service- disabled veteran- owned small business 
(SDVOSB) located in Stafford, Virginia, protests the corrective action undertaken by the 
United States Marine Corps  (USMC) , in response to Catalyst ’s protest challenging the 
agency’s issuance of a competitive task order to Alexandria Insights, Inc. (Alexandria 
Insights), located in Stafford, Virginia,  pursuant to request for proposals (RFP) 
No. M67854- 24-R- 3014, to provide program management support services.  The 
protester alleges that the agency’s proposed corrective action is unreasonable.    
 We deny the protest.

 The RFP, issued o n September 16, 2024, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 
section 16.505 to SDVOSB firms in the National Capital Zone 2 under the Department 
of the Navy’s  SeaPort  indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity contract , sought proposals

and finance; logistics, fielding and training; and engineering, manufacturing and testing-
related activities to include acquisition policy and program documentation development .  
B-423269, Protest exh. 1, RFP at  8.1   
 
The RFP anticipated issuance of a single, fixed -price task order on a best -value tradeoff 
basis  for a 5- year period of performance.  Id.  at 80.  The best -value decision was to be 
based on t he following evaluation factors :  technical ; past performance;  and price.  Id.   
Under the solicitation’s evaluation criteria, the technical factor was more important than 
past performance,  and both non- price factors , when combined,  were more important 
than price.  Id.  The solicitation also established that the agency m ight issue the task 
order to other than the lowest -priced or highest -rated offeror.  Id.   
 The technical factor was comprised of three task elements:  technical approach and 
understanding;  management approach;  and transition plan.  Id.  at 80- 81.  Under these 
task elements , proposals would be assigned ratings of significant strengths, strengths, 
weaknesses, significant weaknesses, or deficiencies  as defined in the solicitation and 
proposals would be assigned overall ratings of either outstanding, good, acceptable, 
marginal, or unacceptable under the technical factor .  Id. at 81-82.   
 Two offerors submitted t imely proposals in response to the solicitation--Catalyst and 
Alexandria Insights .  Following the evaluation of proposals , the agency assigned 
Catalyst’s technical proposal an overall rating of acceptable with an evaluated total price 
of $35,431,630.  See  B-423269, Protest exh. 3a, Technical and Past Performance Eval .  
at 1; exh. 3b, Price Eval. Report at 2.  The agency assigned Alexandria Insights’ 
technical proposal an overall rating of outstanding with an evaluated total price of 
$53,917,708.  Id., exh. 3b, Price Eval. Report at 2; Protest exh. 3, Post-Award Debrief 
at 2.  The agency determined that Alexandria Insights’ higher -rated, higher -priced 
proposal represented the best value to the government  and issued the task order to 
Alexandria Insights  on December 20, 2024.   
 On January 7, 2025, after receipt of the award notice and a debriefing, Catalyst filed a protest challenging the issuance of the task order to Alexandria Insights, which our 
Office docketed as B -423269.  In that protest, Catalyst alleged that the agency 
unreasonably evaluated its technical proposal  as acceptable, raising a number of 
challenges to the agency’s assessment of significant weaknesses and weaknesses in 
its proposal.  Additionally, Catalyst alleged that the agency’s best -value tradeoff 
analysis was unreasonable, arguing that USMC failed to reasonably explain or 
document why the 52 percent price premium associated with selecting Alexandria 
Insights’ higher -priced proposal was justified.

to take voluntary corrective action.  Specifically, the agency would:  (1) amend the 
solicitation to i nclude a provision to evaluate proposals for price realism; (2) request and 
evaluate revised price proposal s for realism ; (3) conduct a new evaluation of technical 
proposal s; and (4) conduct a new tradeoff analysis and source selection decision.  See  
B-423269, Notice of Corrective Action at  1.  As a result  of the agency’s proposed 
corrective action, o ur Office dismissed the protest as academic .  Catalyst Solutions, 
LLC, B-423269, Jan. 29, 2025 (unpublished decision).    
 
Thereafter, Catalyst filed this protest challenging the scope of the proposed corrective 
action, which our Office docketed as B -423269.2.2   
 DISCUSSION  Catalyst objects to the scope of the agency’s corrective action.  S pecifically, Catalyst 
argues that it is unreasonable for the agency to amend the solicitation to include a provision for price realism  because,  in its prior protest, it did not allege that the agency 
failed to evaluate proposals for realism.  Therefore, the protester asserts, USMC cannot 
justify this aspect of the proposed corrective action on the basis of any need to remedy 
a perceived defect that did not exist.  See generally , Protest at 4 -6.  According to the 
protester , the corrective action notice “pres ents no explanation of how a price realism 
analysis is related to a revised best value tradeoff decision” id.  at 4, alleging that the 
agency’s corrective action should be limited to the defects it is intended to remedy.   
 In support of its position, the protester relies on prior decisions of our Office, including 
Kupono Gov’t Servs., LLC; Akima Sys. Eng’g, LLC , B-421392.9 et al., June  5, 2023, 
2023 CPD ¶ 136, in which we sustained a protest of a corrective action on the basis that 
there was no explanation in the contemporaneous record related to the supposed flaw 
in the procurement  that support ed that agency’s decision to take corrective action.  
Among other findings, we stated that  when an agency undertakes corrective action, the 
underlying reasons for the agency decision must be meaningfully explained so that our 
Office can assess whether the proposed corrective action is appropriate to remedy the 
defects identified by the agency in the procurement  process .  Kupono Gov’t Servs., 
LLC; Akima Sys. Eng’g, LLC , supra at 3.   
 
USMC responds that it s decision to a mend the solicitation to include a provision for 
evaluation of price realism was to address additional concerns identified in this 
procurement process.  In this regard, the contracting officer explained that any concerns with unrealistic pricing during the initial evaluation was mitigated by the fact that the agency ultimately selected Alexandria Insights’ higher -rated, higher -priced proposal.  
According to t he agency :  
 
2 As noted, t he awarded value of the previously awarded task order exceeded  
$35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to 
the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under 
the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B ).  Page 4    B-423269.2    
During price evaluation, the Agency noted wide pricing discrepancies in 
the proposals it received from all offerors.   After concluding the 
technical and past performance evaluations, I determined that the 
addition of a price realism provision and new round of price evaluation was not necessary as, pursuant to the relative importance of the three evaluation factors, [Alexandria Insights’] proposal was the most 
advantageous to the Government and its offer price was in line with the Government’s Independent Government Cost Estimate.  
 Contracting Officer ’s Statement at 2- 3 (internal citation omitted) . 
 The agency represents that  after reviewing Catalyst’s initial protest challenging the 
award decision, the contracting officer determined that taking corrective action t o amend 
the solicitation to include a provision for price realism was in the best interest s of the 
government.  In this regard,  to the extent that the agency’s reevaluation could result in 
the consideration of  significantly lower -priced proposal s for award , the agency believed 
it was important to assess whether the prices of such proposals were realistic  during the 
reevaluation.   Specifically, the contracting officer stated :   
 
Given that some pricing received from the original proposals was so drastically low, I am reasonably concerned that it demonstrates a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements.   If an 
offeror were to receive the award, and subsequently be unable to perform at the award price, the disruption to [ Program Manager]  
Expeditionary Radars would be significant . . . .  
 Id. at 3.   
 Given these identified concerns, the agency argues that amending the solicitation to 
include a provision for price realism and allowing offerors to submit revised price proposals, would allow the agency to assess whether the selected contractor can perform the entirety of the solicited services at its offered price.  Memorandum of Law 
at 6-7.  USMC therefore asserts that this aspect of the agency’s proposed corrective 
action is reasonable to address the concerns that it identified.  Id.    
 Contracting agencies have broad discretion to take corrective action where the agency 
determines that such action is necessary to ensure a fair and impartial competition, and, 
generally, the details of a corrective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the contracting agency.  Anders Constr., Inc. , B-420717, July 20, 2022, 2022 CPD  
¶ 187 at  3.  Our Office will not object to any particular corrective action so long as it is 
appropriate to remedy the reasonable concern that caused the agency to take 
corrective action.  See  e.g., 360 IT Integrated Solutions; VariQ Corp. , B-414650.19

Moreover, our review is generally limited to whether the agency’s corrective action is appropriate to remedy the flaw which the agency believes exists in its procurement process, see Onésimus Def., LLC , B-411123.3, B -411123.4, July 24, 2015, 2015 CPD

a prior protest where no decision on the merits was issued by our Office.  Sealift, Inc. , 
B-412041.2, Dec. 30, 2015, 2016 CPD ¶ 9 at 4.    
 Here, based on the record presented, we find no basis to object to the agency’s 
proposed corrective action.  USMC’s judgment that amending the solicitation to include 
a provision for price realism as part of its corrective action was necessary to address  
additional concerns with  the procurement, is a matter within the agency’s discretion and 
one that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the agency’s judgment was unreasonable.  As noted, the agency has explained that because of the significant spread between the proposed prices in the initial proposals , 
where at least one appeared relatively  low, the contracting officer believ es that some of 
the initial proposed prices may reflect the offerors ’ failure to comprehend the complexity 
and risks associated with the solicited requirements.  The agency also has explained that because the task order will be issued on a fixed- price basis, the agency wants to 
avoid a scenario where the selected contractor is unable to perform the contract requirements at the awarded price .  In this regard, amending the solicitation to put 
offerors on notice that USMC will perform a price realism evaluation  would allow the 
agency to address these risks when making its award decision.  
 Our Office has explained that an agency may conduct a price realism evaluation in 
connection with the issuance of a fixed- price task order for the limited purpose s of 
measuring an offeror’s understanding of the solicitation’s requirements  or to assess the 
risk inherent in an offeror’s proposal.  See , e.g., R3 Gov’t Sols., LLC , B-404863.2,  
Sept. 28, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  284 at  5; Puglia Eng’g of California, Inc. , B-297413 et al. , 
Jan. 20, 2006, 2006 CPD ¶ 33 at  6.  While Catalyst disagrees with the agency’s 
judgment, the protester fails to show that amending the solicitation to includ e a provision 
for price realism as part of USMC’s proposed corrective action is unreasonable or 
otherwise violates appli cable procurement law or regulation.   
 To the extent the protester alleges that amending the solicitation to include a price 
realism provision and request ing revised price proposals  will cause Catalyst competitive 
harm  because its price has been exposed, we have recognized that the possibility that a 
contract may not have been awarded based on a fair determination of the most advantageous proposal has a more harmful effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system than does the possibility that a competing offeror w ill be at a 
disadvantage in a reopened procurement because its price has been exposed.  See 
Northrop Grumman Info. Tech., Inc ., B-404263.6, Mar.  1, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 65 at 3.  
 Accordingly, under these circumstances, we find the agency’s proposed corrective  
  Page 6    B-423269.2   actions were a reasonable means of remedying the identified agency concerns to 
ensure a fair and impartial competition.

appropriate to remedy a flaw in the procurement process.   
DECISION  
 Catalyst Solutions, LLC  (Catalyst), a service- disabled veteran- owned small business 
(SDVOSB) located in Stafford, Virginia, protests the corrective action undertaken by the 
United States Marine Corps  (USMC) , in response to Catalyst ’s protest challenging the 
agency’s issuance of a competitive task order to Alexandria Insights, Inc. (Alexandria 
Insights), located in Stafford, Virginia,  pursuant to request for proposals (RFP) 
No. M67854- 24-R- 3014, to provide program management support services.  The 
protester alleges that the agency’s proposed corrective action is unreasonable.    
 We deny the protest.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The RFP, issued o n September 16, 2024, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 
section 16.505 to SDVOSB firms in the National Capital Zone 2 under the Department 
of the Navy’s  SeaPort  indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity contract , sought proposals 
for a contractor to provide support services for the USMC’s Program Manager 
Expeditionary Radars portfolio to include both the ground/air task oriented radar 
program management and product manager future radar systems.  The solicited DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release. 
 
  Page 2    B-423269.2   support services include program management; acquisition and scheduling; business 
and finance; logistics, fielding and training; and engineering, manufacturing and testing-
related activities to include acquisition policy and program documentation development .  
B-423269, Protest exh. 1, RFP at  8.1   
 
The RFP anticipated issuance of a single, fixed -price task order on a best -value tradeoff 
basis  for a 5- year period of performance.  Id.  at 80.  The best -value decision was to be 
based on t he following evaluation factors :  technical ; past performance;  and price.  Id.   
Under the solicitation’s evaluation criteria, the technical factor was more important than 
past performance,  and both non- price factors , when combined,  were more important 
than price.  Id.  The solicitation also established that the agency m ight issue the task 
order to other than the lowest -priced or highest -rated offeror.  Id.   
 The technical factor was comprised of three task elements:  technical approach and 
understanding;  management approach;  and transition plan.  Id.  at 80- 81.  Under these 
task elements , proposals would be assigned ratings of significant strengths, strengths, 
weaknesses, significant weaknesses, or deficiencies  as defined in the solicitation and 
proposals would be assigned overall ratings of either outstanding, good, acceptable, 
marginal, or unacceptable under the technical factor .  Id. at 81-82.   
 Two offerors submitted t imely proposals in response to the solicitation--Catalyst and 
Alexandria Insights .  Following the evaluation of proposals , the agency assigned 
Catalyst’s technical proposal an overall rating of acceptable with an evaluated total price 
of $35,431,630.  See  B-423269, Protest exh. 3a, Technical and Past Performance Eval .  
at 1; exh. 3b, Price Eval. Report at 2.  The agency assigned Alexandria Insights’ 
technical proposal an overall rating of outstanding with an evaluated total price of 
$53,917,708.  Id., exh. 3b, Price Eval. Report at 2; Protest exh. 3, Post-Award Debrief 
at 2.  The agency determined that Alexandria Insights’ higher -rated, higher -priced 
proposal represented the best value to the government  and issued the task order to 
Alexandria Insights  on December 20, 2024.   
 On January 7, 2025, after receipt of the award notice and a debriefing, Catalyst filed a protest challenging the issuance of the task order to Alexandria Insights, which our 
Office docketed as B -423269.  In that protest, Catalyst alleged that the agency 
unreasonably evaluated its technical proposal  as acceptable, raising a number of 
challenges to the agency’s assessment of significant weaknesses and weaknesses in 
its proposal.  Additionally, Catalyst alleged that the agency’s best -value tradeoff 
analysis was unreasonable, arguing that USMC failed to reasonably explain or 
document why the 52 percent price premium associated with selecting Alexandria 
Insights’ higher -priced proposal was justified.

protest B -423269,  as Protest exhibit 1.  R eferences to RFP page numbers in the 
decision are to the Adobe PDF paginations.    Page 3    B-423269.2   On January 27, after reviewing Catalyst’s protest, USMC advised our Office of its intent 
to take voluntary corrective action.  Specifically, the agency would:  (1) amend the 
solicitation to i nclude a provision to evaluate proposals for price realism; (2) request and 
evaluate revised price proposal s for realism ; (3) conduct a new evaluation of technical 
proposal s; and (4) conduct a new tradeoff analysis and source selection decision.  See  
B-423269, Notice of Corrective Action at  1.  As a result  of the agency’s proposed 
corrective action, o ur Office dismissed the protest as academic .  Catalyst Solutions, 
LLC, B-423269, Jan. 29, 2025 (unpublished decision).    
 
Thereafter, Catalyst filed this protest challenging the scope of the proposed corrective 
action, which our Office docketed as B -423269.2.2   
 DISCUSSION  Catalyst objects to the scope of the agency’s corrective action.  S pecifically, Catalyst 
argues that it is unreasonable for the agency to amend the solicitation to include a provision for price realism  because,  in its prior protest, it did not allege that the agency 
failed to evaluate proposals for realism.  Therefore, the protester asserts, USMC cannot 
justify this aspect of the proposed corrective action on the basis of any need to remedy 
a perceived defect that did not exist.  See generally , Protest at 4 -6.  According to the 
protester , the corrective action notice “pres ents no explanation of how a price realism 
analysis is related to a revised best value tradeoff decision” id.  at 4, alleging that the 
agency’s corrective action should be limited to the defects it is intended to remedy.   
 In support of its position, the protester relies on prior decisions of our Office, including 
Kupono Gov’t Servs., LLC; Akima Sys. Eng’g, LLC , B-421392.9 et al., June  5, 2023, 
2023 CPD ¶ 136, in which we sustained a protest of a corrective action on the basis that 
there was no explanation in the contemporaneous record related to the supposed flaw 
in the procurement  that support ed that agency’s decision to take corrective action.  
Among other findings, we stated that  when an agency undertakes corrective action, the 
underlying reasons for the agency decision must be meaningfully explained so that our 
Office can assess whether the proposed corrective action is appropriate to remedy the 
defects identified by the agency in the procurement  process .  Kupono Gov’t Servs., 
LLC; Akima Sys. Eng’g, LLC , supra at 3.   
 
USMC responds that it s decision to a mend the solicitation to include a provision for 
evaluation of price realism was to address additional concerns identified in this 
procurement process.  In this regard, the contracting officer explained that any concerns with unrealistic pricing during the initial evaluation was mitigated by the fact that the agency ultimately selected Alexandria Insights’ higher -rated, higher -priced proposal.  
According to t he agency :  
 
2 As noted, t he awarded value of the previously awarded task order exceeded  
$35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to 
the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under 
the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1)(B ).  Page 4    B-423269.2    
During price evaluation, the Agency noted wide pricing discrepancies in 
the proposals it received from all offerors.   After concluding the 
technical and past performance evaluations, I determined that the 
addition of a price realism provision and new round of price evaluation was not necessary as, pursuant to the relative importance of the three evaluation factors, [Alexandria Insights’] proposal was the most 
advantageous to the Government and its offer price was in line with the Government’s Independent Government Cost Estimate.  
 Contracting Officer ’s Statement at 2- 3 (internal citation omitted) . 
 The agency represents that  after reviewing Catalyst’s initial protest challenging the 
award decision, the contracting officer determined that taking corrective action t o amend 
the solicitation to include a provision for price realism was in the best interest s of the 
government.  In this regard,  to the extent that the agency’s reevaluation could result in 
the consideration of  significantly lower -priced proposal s for award , the agency believed 
it was important to assess whether the prices of such proposals were realistic  during the 
reevaluation.   Specifically, the contracting officer stated :   
 
Given that some pricing received from the original proposals was so drastically low, I am reasonably concerned that it demonstrates a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements.   If an 
offeror were to receive the award, and subsequently be unable to perform at the award price, the disruption to [ Program Manager]  
Expeditionary Radars would be significant . . . .  
 Id. at 3.   
 Given these identified concerns, the agency argues that amending the solicitation to 
include a provision for price realism and allowing offerors to submit revised price proposals, would allow the agency to assess whether the selected contractor can perform the entirety of the solicited services at its offered price.  Memorandum of Law 
at 6-7.  USMC therefore asserts that this aspect of the agency’s proposed corrective 
action is reasonable to address the concerns that it identified.  Id.    
 Contracting agencies have broad discretion to take corrective action where the agency 
determines that such action is necessary to ensure a fair and impartial competition, and, 
generally, the details of a corrective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the contracting agency.  Anders Constr., Inc. , B-420717, July 20, 2022, 2022 CPD  
¶ 187 at  3.  Our Office will not object to any particular corrective action so long as it is 
appropriate to remedy the reasonable concern that caused the agency to take 
corrective action.  See  e.g., 360 IT Integrated Solutions; VariQ Corp. , B-414650.19  
et al. , Oct. 15, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 359 at 6 citing  MSC Indus. Direct Co., Inc. ,

Moreover, our review is generally limited to whether the agency’s corrective action is appropriate to remedy the flaw which the agency believes exists in its procurement process, see Onésimus Def., LLC , B-411123.3, B -411123.4, July 24, 2015, 2015 CPD 
¶ 224 at  5, and not whether the agency’s corrective action remedies the flaws alleged in 
a prior protest where no decision on the merits was issued by our Office.  Sealift, Inc. , 
B-412041.2, Dec. 30, 2015, 2016 CPD ¶ 9 at 4.    
 Here, based on the record presented, we find no basis to object to the agency’s 
proposed corrective action.  USMC’s judgment that amending the solicitation to include 
a provision for price realism as part of its corrective action was necessary to address  
additional concerns with  the procurement, is a matter within the agency’s discretion and 
one that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the agency’s judgment was unreasonable.  As noted, the agency has explained that because of the significant spread between the proposed prices in the initial proposals , 
where at least one appeared relatively  low, the contracting officer believ es that some of 
the initial proposed prices may reflect the offerors ’ failure to comprehend the complexity 
and risks associated with the solicited requirements.  The agency also has explained that because the task order will be issued on a fixed- price basis, the agency wants to 
avoid a scenario where the selected contractor is unable to perform the contract requirements at the awarded price .  In this regard, amending the solicitation to put 
offerors on notice that USMC will perform a price realism evaluation  would allow the 
agency to address these risks when making its award decision.  
 Our Office has explained that an agency may conduct a price realism evaluation in 
connection with the issuance of a fixed- price task order for the limited purpose s of 
measuring an offeror’s understanding of the solicitation’s requirements  or to assess the 
risk inherent in an offeror’s proposal.  See , e.g., R3 Gov’t Sols., LLC , B-404863.2,  
Sept. 28, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶  284 at  5; Puglia Eng’g of California, Inc. , B-297413 et al. , 
Jan. 20, 2006, 2006 CPD ¶ 33 at  6.  While Catalyst disagrees with the agency’s 
judgment, the protester fails to show that amending the solicitation to includ e a provision 
for price realism as part of USMC’s proposed corrective action is unreasonable or 
otherwise violates appli cable procurement law or regulation.   
 To the extent the protester alleges that amending the solicitation to include a price 
realism provision and request ing revised price proposals  will cause Catalyst competitive 
harm  because its price has been exposed, we have recognized that the possibility that a 
contract may not have been awarded based on a fair determination of the most advantageous proposal has a more harmful effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system than does the possibility that a competing offeror w ill be at a 
disadvantage in a reopened procurement because its price has been exposed.  See 
Northrop Grumman Info. Tech., Inc ., B-404263.6, Mar.  1, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 65 at 3.  
 Accordingly, under these circumstances, we find the agency’s proposed corrective  
  Page 6    B-423269.2   actions were a reasonable means of remedying the identified agency concerns to 
ensure a fair and impartial competition.  
 
The protest is denied.

B-423198, Feb. 26, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶ 54, denying its  protest  of the award of a contract 
to ThunderCat Technology, LLC, a service- disabled veteran- owned small business of 
Reston, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. FA442724Q0145, issued by the Department of the Air Force, to provide technology upgrades to an auditorium.  The requester argued that the agency’s evaluation of Mission Analytics’s  technical approach 
was unreasonabl e and the agency’s price analysis was flawed.  We denied the protest 
because the record support ed the agency’s  evaluation of Mission Analytics’s quotation 
as technically unaccept able and the agency’s price evaluation of the awardee’s 
quotation as fair and reasonable.   The requester argues that our decision contained 
errors of fact and law that warrant modification of our prior decision.   
 We deny the request for reconsideration.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on August 6, 2024, as a small business set -aside, 
under the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation parts 12 and 13.  Agency  Page 2 B-423198.2  Report (AR), Tab 4, RFQ at 1.1  The RFQ contemplated the award of a fixed- price 
service contract to upgrade the audio- visual technology of the auditorium used by the 
9th Air Refueling Squadron on Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California.  AR, 
Tab 14, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at 2.  The solicitation advised that 
vendors “shall provide a detailed description and specification of the items included in 
the quote,” and that each quotation “shall meet the needs detailed in the [PWS].”  RFQ at 3.  Award would be made to the “ responsible offeror whose offer . . . will be most 
advantageous” to the government, considering the following evaluation factors:  technical capability and price.  Id.  at 3.  For technical capability, quotations would be 
evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Price would be evaluated for 
reasonableness .  Id.  
 As relevant here, t he solicitation required the installation of a modernized audio -visual 
system , including a 55-inch “confidence monitor ” intended to hang from the ceiling of 
the auditorium.  AR, Tab 14, PWS at 4, 6.  The PWS instructed vendors  that the monitor 
should be “ mounted in the ceiling of the facility and facing the presenter , to show the 
presenter what is on- screen without requiring the presenter to turn -around. ”  Id. at 4.   
 Mission Analytics  submitted two quotations in response to the solicitation, and the 
agency evaluated both quotations as technically unacceptable,  in part because Mission 
Analytics failed  to include a detailed plan to install the confidence monitor  in either 
quotation.   Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 4 -5; AR, Tab 19, Abstract of 
Quotation Evaluations at 1.  As relevant here, the agency determined that both 
quotations omitted  pertinent information such as where the confidence monitor would be 
placed in the auditorium.   AR, Tab 24, Technical Evaluation of Protester’s Quotation 
at 2; COS at 8; Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 7.  The Air Force found only 
ThunderCat’s quotation to be technically acceptable and awarded the contract to 
ThunderCat after finding its price to be fair and reasonable.  COS at 6; AR, Tab 31, 
Price Reasonableness Analysis at 2.  
 After being notified of the award decision and receiving a debriefing, Mission Analytics  
filed an agency -level protest on October 10, which the Air Force dismissed  as untimely .  
AR, Tab 47, Agency -Level Protest Decision.  Mission Analytics then filed a timely 
protest with our Office .  In its protest , the requester  alleged that  the agency improperly 
dismissed Mission Analytics’s agency- level protest, unreasonably evaluated Mission 
Analytics’s quotation as technically unacceptable for failing to provide detail on where 
and how the confidence monitor would be installed,  and unreasonably determined the 
awardee’s price to be fair and reasonable.  Protest at 1- 7, 12-14.   
 On February 26, 2025, our Office denied the protest, finding that the agency  reasonably 
evaluated Mission Analytics’s quotation  as technically unacceptable for failing to 
describe where the confidence monitor would be placed and how installation would

reasonably determined that the awardee’s price was  fair and reasonable.  Id.  at 6-7.  
Mission Analytics filed this request that we reconsider our decision on March 10, 2025.    
 
DISCUSSION  Mission Analytics requests reconsideration of our decision denying its protest and contends that the decision contained errors of law  and fact .  Req. for Recon. at 1 .  In 
this regard, t he requester asserts  that our decision  “ignore[d]”  the allegation that Mission 
Analytics’s agency -level protest was  improperly dismissed.  Id.   The requester further  
argues  that our decision erred by affirming the reasonableness of the agency’s  
evaluation of Mission Analytics’s  quotation as technically unacceptable for not includ ing 
a detailed plan to install the confidence monitor .  Id. at 4-6.  Finally, Mission Analytics  
states  that our  decision failed to address the requester’s argument that  the agency  
unreasonably relied on a comparison to a project  that was “ not similar in scope ” to the 
instant requirement , when analyzing Thundercat’s price quotation .  Id. at 7-8.  For the 
reasons discussed below, we find that none of the arguments presented by the requester provide a basis to grant the request for reconsideration.  
 Under our Bid Protest Regulations, to obtain reconsideration, the requesting party must set out the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification of the decision is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not prev iously 
considered.  4 C.F.R. § 21.14(a).  We will reverse a decision upon reconsideration only 
where the requesting party demonstrates that the decision contains a material error of 
law or fact.  Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp.
‑‑Recon., B -420778.3, Dec. 27, 2022, 2023 CPD    
¶ 39 at 2.  The repetition of arguments made during our consideration of the original 
protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet this standard.  Id. at 5 -7. 
 
As an initial matter , Mission Analytics argues that our decision did not acknowledge that 
the agency erred when it dismissed Mission Analytics’s agency -level protest  as 
untimely .2  As noted above,  however,  after the agency dismissed the requester’ s 
agency -level protest, Mission Analytics filed a timely protest with our Office.  Our Office 
then considered and denied Mission Analytics’s protest .  See Mission Analytics  LLC, 
supra.  By assigning fault to the agency for dismissing the requester’s agency -level 
protest --and ignoring the fact that our Office considered and denied these same 
allegations  in the subsequent protest filed with our Office--the requester fails to identify 
a legal or factual error in our decision supporting reconsideration.   As a result, we 
dismiss this argument . 
 
2 The agency acknowledged, in the agency report filed in response to Mission 
Analytics’s protest, that it  “erred in determining that the entire agency -level protest was 
untimely.”  MOL  at 4 n.2.  Nevertheless, the agency explained that “those timely 
allegations are raised for GAO’s consideration on the merits of the subject protest,” which the agency “addressed [] in its report .”  Id.   
  Page 4 B-423198.2   
Mission Analytics also argues that the agency improperly evaluated the requester’s 
quotation as  unacceptable for failing to explain where and how Mission Analytics 
intended to install the confidence monitor in the auditorium.  Req. for Recon. at  4-6.  In 
this regard, the requester  argues that because the agency provided photographic 
examples of an exi sting confidence monitor mounted in another auditorium, the agency 
should have understood that Mission Analytics  intended to mount the confidence 
monitor in the same location,  and in the same manner , as in the solicitation’s reference 
photos.  See i d. at 4-6.  Mission Analytics raised this same argument in its protes t, 
which our Office considered and rejected when we found that the agency reasonably 
determined that  Mission Analytics failed to adequately  specify where and how Mission 
Analytics intended to install the confidence monitor .  See  Protest at 6, 12; Comments 
at 2; Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 4-5.  Neither the requester’ s repetition of its 
previous argument nor its disagreement with our conclusion provide a basis  for 
reconsideration.   Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  As such, we deny this 
argument.  
 Finally, Mission Analytics contends  that our decision  erred by finding the agency’s price 
evaluation to be reasonable.  Req. for Recon. at 7- 8.  In this regard, the requester  
openly repeats  its argument  that the agency’s price analysis  was flawed because the 
agency compared the awardee’s proposed prices  to contract prices for a requirement  
the requester maintains was “not similar in scope, and in fact, was almost exactly twice 
the scope” of the instant requirement.  Id. at 7.  In the requester’s view, our Office erred 
by not addressing this argument when we concluded that the agency’s price evaluation 
was reasonable.   Id. at 7 -8.   
 We see no basis to reconsider our prior decision.  First,  we note that  Mission Analytics 
incorrectly implies that our Office ignored or otherwise failed to consider  this challenge 
of the agency’s price evaluation.  Although our decisions may not necessarily address 
every argument raised, our Office reviews and decides all issues raised by protesters  
consistent with our mandate to provide for the “inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests .”  Gunnison Consulting Grp., Inc. --Recon., B -418876.5, Feb. 4, 2021, 2021 
CPD ¶ 101 at 5 (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1)) .  Accordingly, t he fact that our decision 
did not address Mission Analytics’s specific argument about the alleged difference in scope between these two requirements does not  mean the argument was not 
considered  by our Office.  Nor does the lack of specific discussion provide a basis to 
reconsider our decision.  See Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, B -417161.3, July 11, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 398 at 4 (noting that “a lack of discussion is not indicative of  an error of fact 
or law”).    Second, as noted above, Mission Analytics raised the same argument in the underlying 
protest.  Compare Comments at 11- 12 with Req. for Recon. at 6- 8.  By repeating this 
argument in its request, Mission Analytics fails to meet our standard for reconsideration.    Page 5 B-423198.2  Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  Accordingly, this argument is likewise 
denied.3 
 
The request is denied.

3 In any event, we note that our conclusion that the agency’s price evaluation was 
reasonable did not rest exclusively on the comparison between the awardee’s prices to the specific contract that the requester alleges was “twice the scope” of the requirement being solicited.  Instead,  our decision assessed the agency’s overall price analysis, 
which relied on multiple methods, such as comparing the awardee’s price to an independent government cost estimate and to the prices of the quotations submitted in response to the solicitation.  Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 6-7.  Our Office weighed 
the entire record, and all aspects of the agency’s documented price analysis, and on this basis we concluded that the agency reasonably determined the awardee’s price to be fair and reasonable.  Id. at 7.",,"

 We deny the request for reconsideration.   
 BACKGROUND  
 The agency issued the solicitation on August 6, 2024, as a small business set -aside, 
under the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation parts 12 and 13.  Agency  Page 2 B-423198.2  Report (AR), Tab 4, RFQ at 1.1  The RFQ contemplated the award of a fixed- price 
service contract to upgrade the audio- visual technology of the auditorium used by the 
9th Air Refueling Squadron on Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California.  AR, 
Tab 14, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at 2.  The solicitation advised that 
vendors “shall provide a detailed description and specification of the items included in 
the quote,” and that each quotation “shall meet the needs detailed in the [PWS].”  RFQ at 3.  Award would be made to the “ responsible offeror whose offer . . . will be most 
advantageous” to the government, considering the following evaluation factors:  technical capability and price.  Id.  at 3.  For technical capability, quotations would be 
evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Price would be evaluated for 
reasonableness .  Id.  
 As relevant here, t he solicitation required the installation of a modernized audio -visual 
system , including a 55-inch “confidence monitor ” intended to hang from the ceiling of 
the auditorium.  AR, Tab 14, PWS at 4, 6.  The PWS instructed vendors  that the monitor 
should be “ mounted in the ceiling of the facility and facing the presenter , to show the 
presenter what is on- screen without requiring the presenter to turn -around. ”  Id. at 4.   
 Mission Analytics  submitted two quotations in response to the solicitation, and the 
agency evaluated both quotations as technically unacceptable,  in part because Mission 
Analytics failed  to include a detailed plan to install the confidence monitor  in either 
quotation.   Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) at 4 -5; AR, Tab 19, Abstract of 
Quotation Evaluations at 1.  As relevant here, the agency determined that both 
quotations omitted  pertinent information such as where the confidence monitor would be 
placed in the auditorium.   AR, Tab 24, Technical Evaluation of Protester’s Quotation 
at 2; COS at 8; Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 7.  The Air Force found only 
ThunderCat’s quotation to be technically acceptable and awarded the contract to 
ThunderCat after finding its price to be fair and reasonable.  COS at 6; AR, Tab 31, 
Price Reasonableness Analysis at 2.  
 After being notified of the award decision and receiving a debriefing, Mission Analytics  
filed an agency -level protest on October 10, which the Air Force dismissed  as untimely .  
AR, Tab 47, Agency -Level Protest Decision.  Mission Analytics then filed a timely 
protest with our Office .  In its protest , the requester  alleged that  the agency improperly 
dismissed Mission Analytics’s agency- level protest, unreasonably evaluated Mission 
Analytics’s quotation as technically unacceptable for failing to provide detail on where 
and how the confidence monitor would be installed,  and unreasonably determined the 
awardee’s price to be fair and reasonable.  Protest at 1- 7, 12-14.   
 On February 26, 2025, our Office denied the protest, finding that the agency  reasonably 
evaluated Mission Analytics’s quotation  as technically unacceptable for failing to 
describe where the confidence monitor would be placed and how installation would

reasonably determined that the awardee’s price was  fair and reasonable.  Id.  at 6-7.  
Mission Analytics filed this request that we reconsider our decision on March 10, 2025.    
 
DISCUSSION  Mission Analytics requests reconsideration of our decision denying its protest and contends that the decision contained errors of law  and fact .  Req. for Recon. at 1 .  In 
this regard, t he requester asserts  that our decision  “ignore[d]”  the allegation that Mission 
Analytics’s agency -level protest was  improperly dismissed.  Id.   The requester further  
argues  that our decision erred by affirming the reasonableness of the agency’s  
evaluation of Mission Analytics’s  quotation as technically unacceptable for not includ ing 
a detailed plan to install the confidence monitor .  Id. at 4-6.  Finally, Mission Analytics  
states  that our  decision failed to address the requester’s argument that  the agency  
unreasonably relied on a comparison to a project  that was “ not similar in scope ” to the 
instant requirement , when analyzing Thundercat’s price quotation .  Id. at 7-8.  For the 
reasons discussed below, we find that none of the arguments presented by the requester provide a basis to grant the request for reconsideration.  
 Under our Bid Protest Regulations, to obtain reconsideration, the requesting party must set out the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification of the decision is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not prev iously 
considered.  4 C.F.R. § 21.14(a).  We will reverse a decision upon reconsideration only 
where the requesting party demonstrates that the decision contains a material error of 
law or fact.  Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp.
‑‑Recon., B -420778.3, Dec. 27, 2022, 2023 CPD    
¶ 39 at 2.  The repetition of arguments made during our consideration of the original 
protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet this standard.  Id. at 5 -7. 
 
As an initial matter , Mission Analytics argues that our decision did not acknowledge that 
the agency erred when it dismissed Mission Analytics’s agency -level protest  as 
untimely .2  As noted above,  however,  after the agency dismissed the requester’ s 
agency -level protest, Mission Analytics filed a timely protest with our Office.  Our Office 
then considered and denied Mission Analytics’s protest .  See Mission Analytics  LLC, 
supra.  By assigning fault to the agency for dismissing the requester’s agency -level 
protest --and ignoring the fact that our Office considered and denied these same 
allegations  in the subsequent protest filed with our Office--the requester fails to identify 
a legal or factual error in our decision supporting reconsideration.   As a result, we 
dismiss this argument . 
 
2 The agency acknowledged, in the agency report filed in response to Mission 
Analytics’s protest, that it  “erred in determining that the entire agency -level protest was 
untimely.”  MOL  at 4 n.2.  Nevertheless, the agency explained that “those timely 
allegations are raised for GAO’s consideration on the merits of the subject protest,” which the agency “addressed [] in its report .”  Id.   
  Page 4 B-423198.2   
Mission Analytics also argues that the agency improperly evaluated the requester’s 
quotation as  unacceptable for failing to explain where and how Mission Analytics 
intended to install the confidence monitor in the auditorium.  Req. for Recon. at  4-6.  In 
this regard, the requester  argues that because the agency provided photographic 
examples of an exi sting confidence monitor mounted in another auditorium, the agency 
should have understood that Mission Analytics  intended to mount the confidence 
monitor in the same location,  and in the same manner , as in the solicitation’s reference 
photos.  See i d. at 4-6.  Mission Analytics raised this same argument in its protes t, 
which our Office considered and rejected when we found that the agency reasonably 
determined that  Mission Analytics failed to adequately  specify where and how Mission 
Analytics intended to install the confidence monitor .  See  Protest at 6, 12; Comments 
at 2; Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 4-5.  Neither the requester’ s repetition of its 
previous argument nor its disagreement with our conclusion provide a basis  for 
reconsideration.   Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  As such, we deny this 
argument.  
 Finally, Mission Analytics contends  that our decision  erred by finding the agency’s price 
evaluation to be reasonable.  Req. for Recon. at 7- 8.  In this regard, the requester  
openly repeats  its argument  that the agency’s price analysis  was flawed because the 
agency compared the awardee’s proposed prices  to contract prices for a requirement  
the requester maintains was “not similar in scope, and in fact, was almost exactly twice 
the scope” of the instant requirement.  Id. at 7.  In the requester’s view, our Office erred 
by not addressing this argument when we concluded that the agency’s price evaluation 
was reasonable.   Id. at 7 -8.   
 We see no basis to reconsider our prior decision.  First,  we note that  Mission Analytics 
incorrectly implies that our Office ignored or otherwise failed to consider  this challenge 
of the agency’s price evaluation.  Although our decisions may not necessarily address 
every argument raised, our Office reviews and decides all issues raised by protesters  
consistent with our mandate to provide for the “inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests .”  Gunnison Consulting Grp., Inc. --Recon., B -418876.5, Feb. 4, 2021, 2021 
CPD ¶ 101 at 5 (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3554(a)(1)) .  Accordingly, t he fact that our decision 
did not address Mission Analytics’s specific argument about the alleged difference in scope between these two requirements does not  mean the argument was not 
considered  by our Office.  Nor does the lack of specific discussion provide a basis to 
reconsider our decision.  See Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, B -417161.3, July 11, 2019, 
2019 CPD ¶ 398 at 4 (noting that “a lack of discussion is not indicative of  an error of fact 
or law”).    Second, as noted above, Mission Analytics raised the same argument in the underlying 
protest.  Compare Comments at 11- 12 with Req. for Recon. at 6- 8.  By repeating this 
argument in its request, Mission Analytics fails to meet our standard for reconsideration.    Page 5 B-423198.2  Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  Accordingly, this argument is likewise 
denied.3 
 
The request is denied.

3 In any event, we note that our conclusion that the agency’s price evaluation was 
reasonable did not rest exclusively on the comparison between the awardee’s prices to the specific contract that the requester alleges was “twice the scope” of the requirement being solicited.  Instead,  our decision assessed the agency’s overall price analysis, 
which relied on multiple methods, such as comparing the awardee’s price to an independent government cost estimate and to the prices of the quotations submitted in response to the solicitation.  Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 6-7.  Our Office weighed 
the entire record, and all aspects of the agency’s documented price analysis, and on this basis we concluded that the agency reasonably determined the awardee’s price to be fair and reasonable.  Id. at 7.   "

DECISION  
 Sanitz Enterprises, Inc., a small business of Fredericksburg, Texas, protests the 
issuance of a delivery order to Containment Corporation, a small business of Murrieta, California, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 1742203, issued by the General Services Administration  (GSA) , Federal Acquisition Service, for steel spill containment 
berms.  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation.

 We deny the protest.  
  
BACKGROUND  
 
On February 3, 2025, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the 
agency issued the RFQ to vendors holding GSA multiple award schedule contracts with 
Special Identification Number  (SIN)  332999P , for spill containment units, containment 
 
1 This protest is not subject to a GAO protective order because Sanitz  opted to proceed 
without outside counsel.  Accordingly, our discussion of some aspects of the record is 
necessarily general in order to limit references to non- public information.  Nonetheless, 
GAO reviewed the entire record in camera in preparing our decision.   Page 2 B-423374  pallets,  and non-wooden pallets .  Agency Report (AR), Tab A1, RFQ at 3.  More 
specifically, the RFQ contemplated the issuance of a single firm-fixed -price delivery 
order for 22 steel spill containment berms for Joint Base Lewis -McChord in Washington.  
Id.  The agency explains that Joint Base Lewis -McChord uses drive- in steel 
containment systems to prevent hazardous substances from leaking into the 
environment.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL)  
at 1.   
 The solicitation provided for award on a lowest -priced, technically acceptable basis, 
considering the following factors:  technical and price.  RFQ at 26.  With regard to the 
price factor, the solicitation stated that once evaluators determined a quotation to be technically acceptable, the agency would evaluate the quoted price for fairness and reasonableness.
2  Id. at 30.  Under the technical factor, the RFQ advised that the 
agency would review vendors’ technical packages on a pass/fail basis for the completion of a technical compliance document and for the submission of supporting 
literature demonstrating that vendors’ products “ meet all required salient characteristics , 
specifications , and can deliver at least a portion of the requirement 30 days [a] fter 
[r]eceipt of [o]rder (ARO) and fulfill the rest by 90 days ARO .”  Id. at 26.   
 As relevant here, regarding the brand name or equal requirement for vendors to submit a product meeting all required salient characteristics and specifications, the solicitation’s required documentation included a technical compliance document  for vendors to 
complete.  Id. at 30.  This attachment asked vendors to either confirm that their product 
was the brand name item listed in the solicitation--the Containment Corporation TriStar 
OPS Containment System --or that the product had trilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, 
and the ability to “relocate [the] filtration system on all four corners of the containment system.”  Id.  Finally, the solicitation incorporated the full text of a FAR provision 
concerning “descriptive literature,” defined as “information furnished by a bidder, such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures, that shows a product’s characteristics or cons truction or explains its operation.”  Id.  at 25; see FAR provision 52.214- 21.  The 
solicitation cautioned that if “the descriptive literature fails to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the bid.”  RFQ at 25; see FAR provision 52.214- 21. 
 
Two vendors, Sanitz and Containment Corporation, submitted quotations by the February 18 closing date for receipt of quotations.

technical requirements of the solicitation.  With regard to Sanitz’s failing rating, the 
agency  documented its finding that  Sanitz completed the technical compliance 
document --indicating that the equipment offered met the solicitation’s required salient 
characteristics --but “did not provide supporting literature demonstrating that their 
products meet all required salient characteristics and specifications. ”  AR, Tab E2, 
Award Decision Document at 4.  As relevant here, because the agency found that  
Sanitz’s technical compliance document conflicted with its supporting literature, the agency emailed Sanitz on February 18, prior to award,  with the opportunity to submit 
any clarifications necessary to support its completed technical compliance document  by 
close of business on February 19.  AR, Tab F8, Email to Sanitz for More Technical Information at 1 .  Specifically, the agency sent the email to the contact listed in Sanitz’s 
quotation and requested further information regarding Sanitz’s product and its compliance with the solicitation’s “or equal” requirements for trilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, and a movable filtration system.  Id .  Sanitz did not respond to this 
email.

 The agency evaluated and assigned a passing rating to Containment Corporation’s technical quotation under all factors ; noted that the vendor could deliver all 
22 containment berms within 30 days after receipt of the order ; and further found the 
price to be fair and reasonable.  COS/MOL  at 3-4.  On March 5, the agency posted a 
notice of its award to Containment Corporation on the GSA eBuy website.   Id. at 4.   On 
March 7, this protest followed.  
 DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably assigned its quotation a failing 
rating and asserts that the containment product it offered met all required technical 
specifications.  Protest at 1.  In support of this argument, Sanitz contends that its submission materials included the completed technical compliance document, which confirmed that its product included the thr ee salient characteristics required for a brand 
name or equal item:  ( 1) trilinear sidewalls, ( 2) fiberglass coating, and ( 3) a filtr ation 
system capable of being relocated to all four corners of the containment system.  
Comments at 2; AR, Tab  B4, Sanitz Technical Compliance Document at 1.  The 
protester also argues the agency should not have considered communications between the agency and the customer for the procurement, Joint Base Lewis -McChord, in 
evaluating the firm’s quotation.  In this context, the protester asserts the customer

berms within 30 days after receipt of the order  and would provide the remaining items 
within 90 days .  COS/MOL  at 3.   
5 Sanitz asserts that this email was sent to an employee who was out of the office.  
Protest at 1.    Page 4 B-423374  improperly  raised concerns about the technical specifications of Sanitz’s offered 
containment system  based upon an image illustrating that containment system in 
Sanitz’s quotation.   Comments at 3.  Ultimately, the protester argues that the agency 
should not have allowed its reservations concerning Sanitz’s product based on the 
vendor’s supporting literature to influence its evaluation of the protester’s quotation, 
given that Sanitz expressly stated its product met the solicitation’s technical specifications  in the submitted technical compliance document.  Id. at 3 -4.   
 The agency responds that Sanitz was responsible for providing all the information 
required by the solicitation and argues that Sanitz failed to provide sufficient technical information for the agency to determine that its  containment system  had the three 
characteristics required of an “equal” item.  COS/MOL  at 4.  GSA notes that , as a 
courtesy,  it gave the protester an opportunity to clarify the technical specifications of its 
product on February 18, and the protester did not respond.  Id .  Subsequently, on 
February 20, the agency sent the technical quotations of both vendors to the customer, Joint Base Lewis -McChord, for review.  Id . at 5.   
 The customer reviewed Sanitz’s technical documentation and stated that the image in 
the supporting literature provided “is just a computer drawing, not an actual containment 
system in use in a military environment.”  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11; see AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications.  The customer also explained that the 
image made it difficult to determine whether the filtration system could be moved to different corners of the containment berm , and whether the container sidewall included 
a rubber insert  rather than the required trilinear sidewall .
6  AR, Tab  F5, Technical 
Review Emails at 11.  In sum, the agency argues that its evaluation of Sanitz’s technical 
documentation, including its communications with Joint Base Lewis -McChord, called 
into question the compliance of the protester’s product with the three salient 
characteristics required by the solicitation.  As a result, the agency asserts that it properly determined that Sanitz’s quotation did not meet the RFQ’s requirements.    
In reviewing a protest challenging an agency’s  technical evaluation, our Office will not 
reevaluate the quotations ; rather , we will examine the record to determine whether the 
agency ’s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.   OPTIMUS Corp .,

 We have considered the record and all of the protester’s arguments, including those that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed here, and find no basis to sustain the protest.  We disagree with the protester’s argument that its quotation clearly 
addressed the solicitation’s technical specifications.  The record shows that the solicitation required “equal” containment systems to include certain characteristics:  
trilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, and a filtration system capable of being moved to 
any of the containment system’s  four corners.  RFQ at 26, 30.  The record also shows 
that both GSA and the customer of the procurement at issue, upon review of the graphic Sanitz provided, could not determine with certainty that the offered product met these three technical specifications.  For example, the page in the protester’s quotation with 
the graphic illustrating the containment system described it as having “upgraded 
coating.”  AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications at 1.  We note the agency ’s 
contemporaneous statement that Sanitz did not respond to the February 18 email to verify if this “upgraded coating” was a fiberglass coating, as required by the solicitation.  AR, Tab E2, Award Decision Document at 8.  We also note the customer’s concer n that 
the graphic depicting Sanitz’s containment system  was a computer drawing and “not an 
actual containment system in use in a military environment ,” and raised questions about 
whether the system had compliant sidewalls  and a movable filter , as re quired by the 
solicitation .  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11.   
 While Sanitz  argues that any questions the agency had regarding its product’s 
compliance with the solicitation should have been resolved by the technical compliance document it completed, we disagree.  Comments at 3 -4.  Sanitz’s completed technical 
compliance document  “checked the boxes” for all three salient characteristics required 
by the solicitation.  However, the record shows that the ambiguous nature of the image 
Sanitz provided in its quotation called into question the protester’s  ability to comply with 
the solicitation’s “equal”  product technical specifications.   AR, Tab E2, Award Decision 
Document at 7.  Specifically, we note the agency’s finding that the literature the 
protester provided “did not fully support that the product they are offering meets all of the three salient characteristics required to meet the needs of the [c]ustomer. ”  Id.  We 
also note the RFQ  provided for reviewing submitted supporting literature on a pass/fail 
basis and further put vendors on notice that if “the descriptive literature fail s to show that 
the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the bid.”  RFQ at 2 5-26.   
 As a result, we agree that the agency reasonably determined that the protester’s quotation did not clearly demonstrate conformance with the solicitation’s technical 
requirements .  To the extent the protester  disagrees, it  was Sanitz’s responsibility to 
submit an adequately written quotation establishing its technical capability.  See Deloitte  Page 6 B-423374  Consulting, LLP, supra.  The protester’s disagreement with GSA’s judgment does not 
establish t hat the agency’s judgment was unreasonable.

specifications.  Protest at 1.  In support of this argument, Sanitz contends that its submission materials included the completed technical compliance document, which confirmed that its product included the thr ee salient characteristics required for a brand 
name or equal item:  ( 1) trilinear sidewalls, ( 2) fiberglass coating, and ( 3) a filtr ation 
system capable of being relocated to all four corners of the containment system.  
Comments at 2; AR, Tab  B4, Sanitz Technical Compliance Document at 1.  The 
protester also argues the agency should not have considered communications between the agency and the customer for the procurement, Joint Base Lewis -McChord, in 
evaluating the firm’s quotation.  In this context, the protester asserts the customer

berms within 30 days after receipt of the order  and would provide the remaining items 
within 90 days .  COS/MOL  at 3.   
5 Sanitz asserts that this email was sent to an employee who was out of the office.  
Protest at 1.    Page 4 B-423374  improperly  raised concerns about the technical specifications of Sanitz’s offered 
containment system  based upon an image illustrating that containment system in 
Sanitz’s quotation.   Comments at 3.  Ultimately, the protester argues that the agency 
should not have allowed its reservations concerning Sanitz’s product based on the 
vendor’s supporting literature to influence its evaluation of the protester’s quotation, 
given that Sanitz expressly stated its product met the solicitation’s technical specifications  in the submitted technical compliance document.  Id. at 3 -4.   
 The agency responds that Sanitz was responsible for providing all the information 
required by the solicitation and argues that Sanitz failed to provide sufficient technical information for the agency to determine that its  containment system  had the three 
characteristics required of an “equal” item.  COS/MOL  at 4.  GSA notes that , as a 
courtesy,  it gave the protester an opportunity to clarify the technical specifications of its 
product on February 18, and the protester did not respond.  Id .  Subsequently, on 
February 20, the agency sent the technical quotations of both vendors to the customer, Joint Base Lewis -McChord, for review.  Id . at 5.   
 The customer reviewed Sanitz’s technical documentation and stated that the image in 
the supporting literature provided “is just a computer drawing, not an actual containment 
system in use in a military environment.”  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11; see AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications.  The customer also explained that the 
image made it difficult to determine whether the filtration system could be moved to different corners of the containment berm , and whether the container sidewall included 
a rubber insert  rather than the required trilinear sidewall .
6  AR, Tab  F5, Technical 
Review Emails at 11.  In sum, the agency argues that its evaluation of Sanitz’s technical 
documentation, including its communications with Joint Base Lewis -McChord, called 
into question the compliance of the protester’s product with the three salient 
characteristics required by the solicitation.  As a result, the agency asserts that it properly determined that Sanitz’s quotation did not meet the RFQ’s requirements.    
In reviewing a protest challenging an agency’s  technical evaluation, our Office will not 
reevaluate the quotations ; rather , we will examine the record to determine whether the 
agency ’s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the 
solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.   OPTIMUS Corp .,

 We have considered the record and all of the protester’s arguments, including those that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed here, and find no basis to sustain the protest.  We disagree with the protester’s argument that its quotation clearly 
addressed the solicitation’s technical specifications.  The record shows that the solicitation required “equal” containment systems to include certain characteristics:  
trilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, and a filtration system capable of being moved to 
any of the containment system’s  four corners.  RFQ at 26, 30.  The record also shows 
that both GSA and the customer of the procurement at issue, upon review of the graphic Sanitz provided, could not determine with certainty that the offered product met these three technical specifications.  For example, the page in the protester’s quotation with 
the graphic illustrating the containment system described it as having “upgraded 
coating.”  AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications at 1.  We note the agency ’s 
contemporaneous statement that Sanitz did not respond to the February 18 email to verify if this “upgraded coating” was a fiberglass coating, as required by the solicitation.  AR, Tab E2, Award Decision Document at 8.  We also note the customer’s concer n that 
the graphic depicting Sanitz’s containment system  was a computer drawing and “not an 
actual containment system in use in a military environment ,” and raised questions about 
whether the system had compliant sidewalls  and a movable filter , as re quired by the 
solicitation .  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11.   
 While Sanitz  argues that any questions the agency had regarding its product’s 
compliance with the solicitation should have been resolved by the technical compliance document it completed, we disagree.  Comments at 3 -4.  Sanitz’s completed technical 
compliance document  “checked the boxes” for all three salient characteristics required 
by the solicitation.  However, the record shows that the ambiguous nature of the image 
Sanitz provided in its quotation called into question the protester’s  ability to comply with 
the solicitation’s “equal”  product technical specifications.   AR, Tab E2, Award Decision 
Document at 7.  Specifically, we note the agency’s finding that the literature the 
protester provided “did not fully support that the product they are offering meets all of the three salient characteristics required to meet the needs of the [c]ustomer. ”  Id.  We 
also note the RFQ  provided for reviewing submitted supporting literature on a pass/fail 
basis and further put vendors on notice that if “the descriptive literature fail s to show that 
the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the bid.”  RFQ at 2 5-26.   
 As a result, we agree that the agency reasonably determined that the protester’s quotation did not clearly demonstrate conformance with the solicitation’s technical 
requirements .  To the extent the protester  disagrees, it  was Sanitz’s responsibility to 
submit an adequately written quotation establishing its technical capability.  See Deloitte  Page 6 B-423374  Consulting, LLP, supra.  The protester’s disagreement with GSA’s judgment does not

 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the RFQ on May 23, 2024, under the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Services -  Business 
Services multiple award schedule contract.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 14, RFQ at 3.
1  
The RFQ, set aside for 8(a) small businesses and issued under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, sought quotations to establish multiple award blanket purchase agreement (BPAs) with vendors to provide technical, administrative, and profess ional support services to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligent & Security (OUSD(I&S)) enterprise.
2  Id. at 3, 76.  The solicitation anticipated 
establishing BPAs consisting of a base year and four 1 -year option periods, and 
contemplated issuing orders against those BPAs on a fixed- price, labor -hour, or time -
and-materials basis.  Id.  at 3.  The “good faith estimate amount” for all BPAs is $856 
million.  Id.  
 
The RFQ provided a performance work statement (PWS) for the BPA’s general 
requirements, and specific PWSs for the two initial call orders that would be awarded 
concurrently with the establishment of the BPAs.  AR, Tab 2a, BPA PWS; AR, Tab 11a, 
Call Order 1 (EXDIR) PWS; AR, Tab 11b, Call Order 2 (SASP) PWS.  Under call 
order  1, the awardee is to provide services to the I&S Executive Directorate (EXDIR).  
AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR Call Order PWS at 1.  With call order 2, the awardee will provide 
services to the Sens itive Activities & Special Programs (SASP) Office.  AR, Tab 11b,  
SASP Call Order PWS at 1.  
 
The solicitation advised that the “evaluation of the BPA will be based on the evaluation 
results for Call Orders 1 and 2,” and that while there may be multiple BPA’s established, 
there “ will only be one awardee for each call order .”  RFQ at 83.  Call orders would be 
issued individually on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering the following evaluation 
factors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id. at 30-31.  The possible 
adjectival ratings for the technical factor were outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, 
and unacceptable.  Id.  at 89- 90.  Past performance would be evaluated and assessed a 
confidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, neutral, limited, or no, confidence.  Id.  
at 90-91. 
 
The technical factor was more important than the past performance factor, and the non-
price factors, when combined, were significantly more important than price.  Id.  at 31.  
The solicitation provided that vendors must be evaluated as acceptable or higher for the

either of the call order evaluations to be eligible for a BPA.  Id.  at 85- 87. 
 The agency received quotations from nine vendors by the July 17, deadline for receipt of quotations.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 5.  In September, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 1 (EXDIR) to, 
Compr ehensive Approach LLC d/b/a Comprehensive Approach Solutions.  COS/MOL 
at 5.  At the same time, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 2 (SASP) 
to, Sancorp.  Id.  Following notification of the awards, Arlo and Premier filed protests 
with our Off ice, challenging the agency’s evaluation and award decisions.  Arlo Sols., 
LLC, B-422985, B -422985.2, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision); Premier Enter. 
Sols., LLC , B-422985.3, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision).  In response, the agency 
advised our office that it intended to take corrective action; specifically, the agency stated that it would terminate the BPAs and call orders, reevaluate quotations, and make new award decisions.  Id .  We dismissed the protests as academic on 
October  16.  Id. 
 The agency summarized the results of the reevaluation as follows:

 AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 21, 36.
3  The contracting 
officer, who was the source selection authority (SSA), determined that WHS would 
establish BPAs with four vendors, including Sancorp, Premier, and Arlo.  COS/MOL 
at 6.  Relevant here, the SSA found that Premier’s quotation represented the best value 
for the EXDIR call order, and that Arlo’s quotation represented the best value for the 
SASP call order, and the agency issued the orders accordingly.  AR, Tab 45, SSDD 
at 35, 45.  This protest followed.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s quotations for the EXDIR 
and SASP call orders, Premier’s quotation for the EXDIR call order, and Arlo’s quotation 
 
3 The final adjectival rating for Sancorp for the SASP call order is reflected in the 
technical evaluation report.  AR, Tab 26,  Sancorp SASP Technical Evaluation Board 
(TEB) Report at 1.   Page 4 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  for the SASP call order.4  Protest at 11- 13, 26- 32; Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 10, 
13-15.  Specifically, the protester contests the agency’s assessment of a weakness in 
Sancorp’s quotation under the technical factor for the EXDIR call order and contends 
that the agency should have identified technical weaknesses in Premier’s quotation.   
Comments & Supp. Protest at 11 -15.  Sancorp also challenges the agency’s evaluation 
under the technical and past performance evaluation factors and the agency’s best -
value tradeoff for the SASP call order.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 8-10, 15- 18.  Although we do not specifically address  every issue raised,  we have 
considered all of Sancorp’s arguments , and we find no basis on which to sustain the 
protest.  
 Call Order 1 (EXDIR)  
 Sancorp’s protest of the EXDIR call order is focused on the agency’s evaluation, under the technical factor, of its own, as well as Premier’s, quotation.   
  Sancorp’s Quotation 
 First, Sancorp contends that the agency “failed to consider parts of Sancorp’s” technical quotation or “failed to adequately document the bases for their evaluation conclusions” in assigning a weakness in the evaluation.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13- 15.  The 
agency defends its evaluation of Sancorp’s technical quotation as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  COS/MOL at 9- 19. 
 Under the technical factor, vendors were required to address, among other things, “an 
effective method to accomplish the critical tasks identified” from the PWS for the EXDIR 
call order.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  The RFQ specified three critical task areas for this call order, including task 5.1 (professional, policy, consulting, technical and analytical support).  Id.   Task 5.1 consisted of six support subtasks:  
(1) legislative research analysis; (2) policy analysis and technical servic es; (3) strategy 
and performance assessments; (4) data analysis; (5) research and business analysis; and (6) all source intelligence analysis.  AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 14 -18. 
 The evaluators assessed a weakness in Sancorp’s quotation for its technical approach to this critical PWS task.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 2.  The evaluators found that Sancorp’s quotation met the requirements for five of the six subtasks.  Id. 
at 2-4.  For the research and business analysis subtask, however, the evaluators were 
concerned that Sancorp’s quotation “specifically [did] not clearly address the requirements to engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S).”  Id. at 3. 
 The evaluation of a vendor ’s quotation is a matter within the agency ’s discretion.

agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’ s terms and 
applicable procurement laws and regulations.  AllWorld Language Consultants, Inc. , 
B-414244, B -414244.2, Apr. 3, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  111 at 3.  A protester ’s disagreement 
with the agency ’s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was 
unreasonable.   Technology & Telecomms. Consultants, Inc. , B-413301, B -413301.2, 
Sept. 28,  2016, 2016 CPD ¶  276 at 4.  
 The protester maintains that the solicitation requires the contractor to “interface with experts across the Intelligence Community, U.S. Government, and external organizations to expand understanding of critical issues relevant to Great Power Competition, to include travel” and that its quotation addressed this requirement.
5  See  
AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 17.  Sancorp asserts that its quotation “explained its 
approach to coordination across various stakeholders external to the OUSD(I&S).”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The protester invokes two passages from its quotation that refer to Sanc orp’s work “ensuring the viability and reliability of the US 
Defense Industrial Base” and “how it had accomplished similar cross -collaboration on 
prior contracts.”  Id.  Alternatively, the protester argues that the evaluators should have 
found that Sancorp’s approach to a separate subtask --all source intelligence analysis --
mitigated the effect of failing to address the interface required for research and business analysis.  Id.  at 15.  
 
The agency explains that the protester’s quotation--including the paragraphs invoked 
during the protest --sets forth Sancorp’s “understanding” that cross -collaboration is 
required, but that the quotation did not actually describe a specific method to 
accomplish this critical task.  COS/MOL at 14 -15; AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB 
Report at 3 -4 (finding quotation “specifically does not clearly address the requirements 
to engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S)”).  Although, the agency acknowledged 
that Sanc orp’s quotation “partially cover[ed]” an approach to cross -collaboration under 
its response to another subtask (all source intelligence analysis), the evaluators found 
that this did not entirely mitigate the weakness from the missing detail in Sancorp’s 
quotation.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 3- 4.  According to the 
evaluators, that portion of Sancorp’s quotation only addressed the intelligence 
community rather than the broader universe of stakeholders, and it was “not clear to the 
Government how  Sancorp would fully apply” the approach to research and business 
analysis.  Id.  at 4.   
 
As our decisions have explained, i t is a vendor ’s burden to submit a well -written 
quotation with adequately detailed information to meet  the solicitation requirements, and 
to allow for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Innovative M gmt. Concepts, 
 
5 Great Power Competition refers to an era of “intensified U.S. competition with China 
and Russia, as well as challenges by those two countries and others to elements of the 
U.S.-led international order established after World War II.”  Congressional Resear ch 
Service, R43848, Great Power Competition:  Implications for Defense--Issues for Congress 38 (2024).   Page 6 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  Inc., B-419834.2, B -419834.3, Sept. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 319 at 7.  While the 
protester expresses its opinion that its quotation adequately responded to the 
solicitation, the evaluators found otherwise, and disagreement with the evaluators ’ 
conclusions, without more, provides no reason for us to question the agency ’s 
evaluative judgments.  Id.  Further, although the protester asserts that the two cited 
portions of its quotation address the approach to broad- based cross -collaboration that 
the evaluators determined was missing, Sancorp does not explain how the quotation specified an approach rather than simply reiterating the firm’s claims to experience.   
 Indeed, the only reference to cross -collaboration methods in this part of Sancorp’s 
quotation is not a complete thought:  “Team Sancorp will cooperate across EXDIR support efforts to ensure that contract support.”  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 20.  Nor does the protester identify any flaw in the evaluators’ conclusion 
that Sancorp’s specific discussion of interfacing with the intelligence community did not in fact expressly address similar interaction with the broader universe of stakeholders  as 
required by the solicitation.  Accordingly, we deny the protester ’s challenges to the 
evaluation of a weakness in the firm’s quotation.  See, e.g., CACI, Inc. --Fed. , 
B-420729.2, Mar. 1, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 51 at 9 (denying evaluation challenge where the 
protester simply held “ a different opinion from the evaluators about the information in 
[the protester ’s] proposal ”); Innovative M gmt. Concepts, Inc. , supra . 
 Next, the protester contends that the agency should have assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding, rather than good, to Sancorp’s quotation under the technical evaluation factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10.  According to the protester, WHS was obligated to assign a rating of outstanding to Sancorp’s technical quotation because the 
agency had identified multiple strengths --and only a single weakness --during the 
evaluation.  Id.  
 We have consistently stated that the essence of an agency ’s evaluation is reflected in 
the evaluation record itself, not the adjectival ratings.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , 
B-400670.2, B -400670.3, May 28, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 120 at 9.  Moreover, as a general 
matter, adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and not a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Science Applications Int ’l Corp. , B-407105, B -407105.2, 
Nov. 1, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 310 at 9.  The relevant question here is not what adjectival 
rating should have been assigned by the agency, but whether the underlying evaluation is reasonable and supports the source selection decision.  See INDUS Tech., Inc. , 
B-411702 et al. , Sept. 29, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 304 at 4.    
 In support of this challenge, the protester simply quotes the solicitation’s definition of the pertinent adjectival ratings and argues that the strengths assessed to Sancorp’s quotation “clearly aligned with the Outstanding rating criteria in the RFQ, rather than the Good rating that the [evaluators]  assigned Sancorp.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10. 
The protester does not otherwise argue why the substance of its quotation merited a higher rating.  In sum, the essence of Sancorp’s challenge is not to the underlying evaluation but to the resulting adjectival rating.  On this record, Sancorp’s disagreement  Page 7 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  with its rating does not provide a basis to conclude that the agency’s evaluation was 
unreasonable.  As such, this challenge is also denied.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , supra.  
  Premier’s Quotation 
 Sancorp also challenges the agency’s evaluation of Premier’s technical quotation for the EXDIR call order.  According to the protester, the agency “missed flaws” --failures to 
comply with material solicitation requirements --in the awardee’s quotation.  Comm ents 
& Supp. Protest at 11- 13.  The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. COS/MOL at 15 -24.  While we do not 
address every assertion raised, we have reviewed all the arguments, and we discuss a representative example below.  
 Among the critical tasks identified for the EXDIR call order was PWS task 5.5 (administrative and human resources support).  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  Under this task, subtask 5.5.2 (executive secretariat support), required records 
management liaison support for the “planning, development, and maintenance of a user-friendly, effective file system compliant with Department regulations.”  AR, 
Tab 11a, EXDIR PWS at 29.  This was to include advising on “digitization” and 
maintaining “paperless  archives.”  Id. 
 Premier’s quotation addressed the administrative and human resources support task, identifying the following “four overarching needs” that shaped the firm’s approach for all work, including electronic records:  technical expertise, systems thinking, emotional intelligence, and reality testing.  AR, Tab 27, Premier Technical Quotations at 15- 16.  
Specific to the executive secretariat support, Premier acknowledges the need for personnel to have “a holistic sense” of the organization and applicable policies and procedures and discusses how it will apply its approach to records management.  Id.  
at 17.   
 The protester contends the awardee’s technical quotation fails to demonstrate “experience in maintaining and posting electronic archives” and does not specifically address National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards for such archives.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13.  The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably found that Premier proposed a comprehensive technical approach to the executive secretariat support work, including electronic archives.  Supp. COS/MOL at 21-22. 
 Here, the record reflects that WHS found that Premier’s quotation met the requirements for this subtask.  AR, Tab 36, Premier EXDIR TEB Report at 5.  According to the evaluators, Premier’s quotation detailed an adequate approach to the work.  Id.  
Although the protester contends that the level of detail provided by Premier was inadequate, nothing in the solicitation required vendors to detail their experience performing similar requirements.  Instead, the RFQ provided that vendors should describe “an effect ive method to accomplish the critical tasks” that evidenced 
understanding of the work required.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  While  Page 8 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  the protester advocates that the task is better addressed by detailing experience and 
specifically naming NARA in its response, that opinion does not demonstrate that the awardee’s approach was deficient with respect to meeting the requirements of the PWS.   Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, B -422823.2, Nov. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 272 at 5 (denying protest alleging that awardee should have received weakness 
where the protester merely disagreed with the agency’s assessment).  
 To the extent the protester’s objection is that the contemporaneous record includes a very limited examination of Premier’s approach to electronic records, our Office has consistently explained that agencies need not document all determinations of adequacy .  
Allied Tech. Grp. , Inc., B -412434, B -412434.2, Feb. 10, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 74 at 13 
(finding an agency is not required to document why a quotation did not receive a weakness for a particular item).  This argument --and the similar arguments Sancorp 
raises about other elements of the awardee’s quotation--are therefore denied.  
 Call Order 2 (SASP)  
 Sancorp also protests the issuance of the SASP call order to Arlo.  The protester challenges multiple elements of the agency’s evaluation of its own quotation and the quotation of the awardee under the technical and past performance evaluation factors, as well as the reasonableness of the best -value tradeoff.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments 
& Supp. Protest at  8-10, 15- 18.   
 After submission of the agency report, the intervenor, Arlo, filed comments along with a request for dismissal of the protest arguments related to the SASP call order.  Arlo 
argues that the protester’s quotation for this call order is technically unacceptable and cannot form the basis for an award because Sancorp knew that one of its proposed key personnel became unavailable after quotations were submitted, but prior to the agency making award.  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 5- 10.  The agency subsequently file d a 
response in support of the intervenor’s request for dismissal.  Supp. COS/MOL at 3- 4.  
For the reasons explained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate.  
  Key Personnel  
 When, as here, a solicitation requires resumes for  key personnel, the resumes form a 
material requirement of the solicitation.  YWCA of Greater Los Angeles , B-414596 et al. , 
July 24, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  245 at 4.  Offerors are obligated to advise agencies of 
changes in proposed resources to satisfy material requirements, even after submission of proposals  or quotations , including if an individual proposed for a key personnel 
position is no longer available.  Chenega Healthcare Servs., LLC , B-416158, June 4, 
2018, 2018 CPD ¶  200 at  3 n.2.  The duty to notify does not arise, however, if a vendor 
does not have actual knowledge of the employee’s unavailability.  Ashlin Mgmt. Grp. , 
B-419472.3, B -419472.4, Nov. 4, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 357 at 4- 5.  When an agency is 
notified of the withdrawal of a key person, the agency cannot proceed with award to that quotation.  Id.  Instead, the agency has two options:  either reject the quotation  as  Page 9 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  technically unacceptable for failing to meet a material requirement, or open discussions 
with all remaining vendors  to permit proposal revisions.  Id. 
 Here, under the technical factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose individuals for nine key personnel positions including, as relevant here, staff officer (subject matter expert level IV).  RFQ at 87; AR, Tab 11b,  SASP PWS at 5 -6.  Vendors were required to 
submit resumes and letters of commitment for the identified key personnel.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 7- 8. 
 Sancorp proposed an individual who we refer to as “X” for a staff officer key personnel position.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp submitted X’s resume, which explained that X had joined Sancorp in April 2024 and “currently suppor ts OUSD(I&S)” under an incumbent effort.  Id.  Sancorp also submitted a letter of 
commitment signed by X, in which X agreed to work for Sancorp in the key personnel role in the event of award to the firm.  AR, Tab 51, Sancorp BPA Quotation at 12.  The evaluators assigned a strength to Sancorp’s quotation based on X’s qualifications for 
the key personnel role.  AR, Tab 26, Sancorp SASP TEB Report at 11.  Based, in part, on X and the other key personnel, the evaluators assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding to Sancorp’s quotation.  Id. at 2. 
 Citing “public information,” the intervenor asserts that in February 2025, X “left the employment of Sancorp and began working for another company . . . as an Operations Officer/Research Analyst, rendering X unavailable to fill the key position for which Sancorp proposed him.”  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 4.  Our Office directed Sancorp to 
respond to the intervenor’s request for dismissal.  Electronic Protest Docketing System 
No. 38.   
 In its response, Sancorp confirms that X “resigned from Sancorp in February 2025” and provided a copy of X’s letter of resignation, dated February 7, 2025--before the agency issued the SASP call order at issue.  Supp. Comments at 3; exh. B to Supp. Comment s.  
Sancorp nonetheless contends that it did not have an obligation to inform the agency because the firm did not have actual knowledge of X’s unavailability.  Supp. Comments at 2-3.  Indeed, Sancorp argues:  
 
Even where employees have resigned, retired, or otherwise left the contractor who proposed them as key personnel, absent notice that the 
employees were no longer available in case of award, GAO has held that 
no notice to the procuring agency is required.  
 
Id. at 3 (citing DZSP 21, LLC , B-410486.10, Jan. 10, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 155 at 10).  In 
this connection, the protester asserts that X had “left Sancorp amicably.”  Id.   According 
to the protester, because X “left Sancorp on good terms,” only if X affirmatively and specifically withdrew his letter of commitment or otherwise “indicate[d] that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won the award” would Sancorp have had actual 
knowledge of X’s unavailability.  Id.  at 3.  Sancorp hints --without committing --that it 
would successfully rehire X if it received the SASP task order.  Id. (“[X] did not withdraw  Page 10 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  his letter of commitment or indicate that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won 
the award . . . and that letter of commitment remains valid to dat e.”). 
 Our Office has rejected arguments that a firm had actual knowledge of a proposed key individual’s unavailability where, notwithstanding resignation or retirement of key personnel, the protester advanced a credible basis to deny actual knowledge of unavailability.  For example, in Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422118.2, B -422118.3, 
July 30, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 184, we could not conclude that a firm had actual 
knowledge of unavailability of an individual proposed for a key personnel position that was employed by a proposed subcontractor.  There, the firm did not receive direct notification of the individual’s retirement --instead, the subcontractor had separately 
provided reassurance of the continued availability of the individual.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  In other instances, we did not find actual knowledge of 
unavailability where the proposed individuals themselves have reaffirmed their ongoing availability in statements submitted within the protest record.  See, e.g., DKW 
Commc’ns, Inc. , B-414476,  B-414476.2, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 206 at 9 (finding 
firm’s “belief regarding [individual’s] continued availability was a well -founded one, as it 
was based on information provided by [the individual] himself”).  Similarly, in DZSP 21, LLC, we found no “evidence of an affirmative, material misrepresentation” of the 
continued availability of key personnel proposed despite employment changes where documents produced during the protest reflected that (1) the individuals did not advise the offeror of their unavailability (or employment changes); and (2) the individuals “all appear interested in assuming the positions for which they had been proposed.”  DZSP 21, LLC , supra at 11- 12. 
 
By contrast, X was --as touted by Sancorp in its quotation--employed by Sancorp and 
performing on an incumbent effort at the time of quotation submission.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp itself received specific, direct communicat ion of a significant change in X’s circumstances when X resigned his 
position with Sancorp on the incumbent effort while quotations were pending.  Supp. Comments at 2; Supp. Comments, exh. B.  That X had signed a letter of commitment in July 2024 when quot ations were submitted, however, does not immunize Sancorp from 
any knowledge of unavailability, and does not provide a permanent and unrebuttable presumption of continued availability despite a change in circumstances.  See  Booz 
Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  Here, the record reflects that X submitted a letter of 
resignation on February 7 and subsequently left Sancorp’s employ later that month.  Supp. Comments, exh. B at 1 (resignation letter of X stating, “my last official day will be 14 February 2025” ).  Relevant here, the protester has not provided any evidence or 
statement from X, himself, reaffirming his availability or willingness to return to the firm to perform the key position for which he was quoted to perform by Sancorp.  See , DKW 
Commc’ns, Inc. , supra .   Consequently, we find unpersuasive the protester’s argument 
now that Sancorp lacked “actual knowledge” of the employee’s unavailability simply because X did not --after tendering his resignation--also affirmatively withdraw the letter 
of commit ment X had signed months earlier.  See  Ashlin Mgmt. Grp. , supra at 5 
(denying argument that awardee lacked “actual knowledge” of unavailability of individual  Page 11 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  proposed as key personnel --despite individual’s resignation--because individual could 
potentially be rehired).  
 
As our decisions have found, because Sancorp had actual knowledge of the unavailability of X, the protester was obligated to advise the agency of the unavailability of the quoted key person, even after submission of  quotations.  Chenega Healthcare 
Servs., LLC , supra.  Having failed to do so, Sancorp’s quotation was rendered 
unacceptable and therefore, ineligible for award.

 Interested Party  
 
Under the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, only an interested party may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. §§  3551- 3557.  That is, 
a protester must be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract. 4 C.F.R.  § 21.0(a)(1).  In a post -award context, we have generally found that a protester 
is an interested party to challenge an agency ’s evaluation only where there is a 
reasonable possibility that the protester would be next in line for award if its protest 
were sustained.   CACI, Inc. -Fed., B-419499, Mar. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  125 at 5.   A 
protester is therefore not an interested party if it would not be eligible to receive a contract award were its protest to be sustained.  Win Aviation, Inc. , B-422037, 
B-422037.2, Dec. 21, 2023, 2024 CPD ¶  12 at 6.    
 As discussed above, an unacceptable quotation cannot form the basis of award.  
Paragon Sys., Inc. , B-422828, B -422828.2, Nov. 19, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 283 at 10.  
Where, as here, the record reflects that the protester’s quotation for the SASP call order 
was unacceptable, Sancorp does not qualify as an interested party to challenge other aspects of the agency’s evaluation and selection decision with respect to the issuance of the SASP call order.  Orion Gov’t Servs., supra at 7.  The challenges to the SASP call 
order are therefore dismissed.  
 The protest is denied.

DECISION  
 Sancorp Consulting, LLC , a small business of Falls Church, Virginia, protests the 
issuance of orders  to Premier Enterprise Solutions, LLC , a small business of Upper 
Marlboro, Maryland, and Arlo Solutions, LLC, a small business of Washington, D.C., under request for quotations  (RFQ) No. HQ003424R0178, issued by the Department of 
Defense, Washington Headquarters Service (WHS) , for technical, administrative, and 
professional support services.   The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of 
quotations and the best -value tradeoff decisions for each call order.  
 We deny the protest.  
 DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  
The decision issued on the date below was subject to 
a GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has 
been approved for public release.  
 
  Page 2 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  BACKGROUND  
 
The agency issued the RFQ on May 23, 2024, under the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Services -  Business 
Services multiple award schedule contract.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 14, RFQ at 3.
1  
The RFQ, set aside for 8(a) small businesses and issued under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, sought quotations to establish multiple award blanket purchase agreement (BPAs) with vendors to provide technical, administrative, and profess ional support services to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligent & Security (OUSD(I&S)) enterprise.
2  Id. at 3, 76.  The solicitation anticipated 
establishing BPAs consisting of a base year and four 1 -year option periods, and 
contemplated issuing orders against those BPAs on a fixed- price, labor -hour, or time -
and-materials basis.  Id.  at 3.  The “good faith estimate amount” for all BPAs is $856 
million.  Id.  
 
The RFQ provided a performance work statement (PWS) for the BPA’s general 
requirements, and specific PWSs for the two initial call orders that would be awarded 
concurrently with the establishment of the BPAs.  AR, Tab 2a, BPA PWS; AR, Tab 11a, 
Call Order 1 (EXDIR) PWS; AR, Tab 11b, Call Order 2 (SASP) PWS.  Under call 
order  1, the awardee is to provide services to the I&S Executive Directorate (EXDIR).  
AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR Call Order PWS at 1.  With call order 2, the awardee will provide 
services to the Sens itive Activities & Special Programs (SASP) Office.  AR, Tab 11b,  
SASP Call Order PWS at 1.  
 
The solicitation advised that the “evaluation of the BPA will be based on the evaluation 
results for Call Orders 1 and 2,” and that while there may be multiple BPA’s established, 
there “ will only be one awardee for each call order .”  RFQ at 83.  Call orders would be 
issued individually on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering the following evaluation 
factors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id. at 30-31.  The possible 
adjectival ratings for the technical factor were outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, 
and unacceptable.  Id.  at 89- 90.  Past performance would be evaluated and assessed a 
confidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, neutral, limited, or no, confidence.  Id.  
at 90-91. 
 
The technical factor was more important than the past performance factor, and the non-
price factors, when combined, were significantly more important than price.  Id.  at 31.  
The solicitation provided that vendors must be evaluated as acceptable or higher for the

either of the call order evaluations to be eligible for a BPA.  Id.  at 85- 87. 
 The agency received quotations from nine vendors by the July 17, deadline for receipt of quotations.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS/MOL) at 5.  In September, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 1 (EXDIR) to, 
Compr ehensive Approach LLC d/b/a Comprehensive Approach Solutions.  COS/MOL 
at 5.  At the same time, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 2 (SASP) 
to, Sancorp.  Id.  Following notification of the awards, Arlo and Premier filed protests 
with our Off ice, challenging the agency’s evaluation and award decisions.  Arlo Sols., 
LLC, B-422985, B -422985.2, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision); Premier Enter. 
Sols., LLC , B-422985.3, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision).  In response, the agency 
advised our office that it intended to take corrective action; specifically, the agency stated that it would terminate the BPAs and call orders, reevaluate quotations, and make new award decisions.  Id .  We dismissed the protests as academic on 
October  16.  Id. 
 The agency summarized the results of the reevaluation as follows:  
 
Call Order 1 (EXDIR)  Sancorp  Premier  
Technical  Good  Outstanding  
Past performance  Satisfactory Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  
Price  $99,312,935  $94,819,501  
 
Call Order 2 (SASP)  Sancorp  Arlo 
Technical  Outstanding  Outstanding  
Past performance  Satisfactory Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  
Price  $91,450,294  $87,748,037  
 AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 21, 36.
3  The contracting 
officer, who was the source selection authority (SSA), determined that WHS would 
establish BPAs with four vendors, including Sancorp, Premier, and Arlo.  COS/MOL 
at 6.  Relevant here, the SSA found that Premier’s quotation represented the best value 
for the EXDIR call order, and that Arlo’s quotation represented the best value for the 
SASP call order, and the agency issued the orders accordingly.  AR, Tab 45, SSDD 
at 35, 45.  This protest followed.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 The protester challenges the agency’s evaluation of the firm’s quotations for the EXDIR 
and SASP call orders, Premier’s quotation for the EXDIR call order, and Arlo’s quotation 
 
3 The final adjectival rating for Sancorp for the SASP call order is reflected in the 
technical evaluation report.  AR, Tab 26,  Sancorp SASP Technical Evaluation Board 
(TEB) Report at 1.   Page 4 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  for the SASP call order.4  Protest at 11- 13, 26- 32; Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 10, 
13-15.  Specifically, the protester contests the agency’s assessment of a weakness in 
Sancorp’s quotation under the technical factor for the EXDIR call order and contends 
that the agency should have identified technical weaknesses in Premier’s quotation.   
Comments & Supp. Protest at 11 -15.  Sancorp also challenges the agency’s evaluation 
under the technical and past performance evaluation factors and the agency’s best -
value tradeoff for the SASP call order.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments & Supp. Protest 
at 8-10, 15- 18.  Although we do not specifically address  every issue raised,  we have 
considered all of Sancorp’s arguments , and we find no basis on which to sustain the 
protest.  
 Call Order 1 (EXDIR)  
 Sancorp’s protest of the EXDIR call order is focused on the agency’s evaluation, under the technical factor, of its own, as well as Premier’s, quotation.   
  Sancorp’s Quotation 
 First, Sancorp contends that the agency “failed to consider parts of Sancorp’s” technical quotation or “failed to adequately document the bases for their evaluation conclusions” in assigning a weakness in the evaluation.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13- 15.  The 
agency defends its evaluation of Sancorp’s technical quotation as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  COS/MOL at 9- 19. 
 Under the technical factor, vendors were required to address, among other things, “an 
effective method to accomplish the critical tasks identified” from the PWS for the EXDIR 
call order.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  The RFQ specified three critical task areas for this call order, including task 5.1 (professional, policy, consulting, technical and analytical support).  Id.   Task 5.1 consisted of six support subtasks:  
(1) legislative research analysis; (2) policy analysis and technical servic es; (3) strategy 
and performance assessments; (4) data analysis; (5) research and business analysis; and (6) all source intelligence analysis.  AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 14 -18. 
 The evaluators assessed a weakness in Sancorp’s quotation for its technical approach to this critical PWS task.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 2.  The evaluators found that Sancorp’s quotation met the requirements for five of the six subtasks.  Id. 
at 2-4.  For the research and business analysis subtask, however, the evaluators were 
concerned that Sancorp’s quotation “specifically [did] not clearly address the requirements to engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S).”  Id. at 3. 
 The evaluation of a vendor ’s quotation is a matter within the agency ’s discretion.  
OBXtek, Inc., B -415258, Dec. 12, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  381 at 6.  Where, as here, an 
agency issues an RFQ to FSS vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a

protester’s challenges pertain to the issuance of the two call orders.  Id.  Page 5 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  competition for the issuance of an order, we will review the record to ensure that the 
agency ’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’ s terms and 
applicable procurement laws and regulations.  AllWorld Language Consultants, Inc. , 
B-414244, B -414244.2, Apr. 3, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  111 at 3.  A protester ’s disagreement 
with the agency ’s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was 
unreasonable.   Technology & Telecomms. Consultants, Inc. , B-413301, B -413301.2, 
Sept. 28,  2016, 2016 CPD ¶  276 at 4.  
 The protester maintains that the solicitation requires the contractor to “interface with experts across the Intelligence Community, U.S. Government, and external organizations to expand understanding of critical issues relevant to Great Power Competition, to include travel” and that its quotation addressed this requirement.
5  See  
AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 17.  Sancorp asserts that its quotation “explained its 
approach to coordination across various stakeholders external to the OUSD(I&S).”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The protester invokes two passages from its quotation that refer to Sanc orp’s work “ensuring the viability and reliability of the US 
Defense Industrial Base” and “how it had accomplished similar cross -collaboration on 
prior contracts.”  Id.  Alternatively, the protester argues that the evaluators should have 
found that Sancorp’s approach to a separate subtask --all source intelligence analysis --
mitigated the effect of failing to address the interface required for research and business analysis.  Id.  at 15.  
 
The agency explains that the protester’s quotation--including the paragraphs invoked 
during the protest --sets forth Sancorp’s “understanding” that cross -collaboration is 
required, but that the quotation did not actually describe a specific method to 
accomplish this critical task.  COS/MOL at 14 -15; AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB 
Report at 3 -4 (finding quotation “specifically does not clearly address the requirements 
to engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S)”).  Although, the agency acknowledged 
that Sanc orp’s quotation “partially cover[ed]” an approach to cross -collaboration under 
its response to another subtask (all source intelligence analysis), the evaluators found 
that this did not entirely mitigate the weakness from the missing detail in Sancorp’s 
quotation.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 3- 4.  According to the 
evaluators, that portion of Sancorp’s quotation only addressed the intelligence 
community rather than the broader universe of stakeholders, and it was “not clear to the 
Government how  Sancorp would fully apply” the approach to research and business 
analysis.  Id.  at 4.   
 
As our decisions have explained, i t is a vendor ’s burden to submit a well -written 
quotation with adequately detailed information to meet  the solicitation requirements, and 
to allow for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Innovative M gmt. Concepts, 
 
5 Great Power Competition refers to an era of “intensified U.S. competition with China 
and Russia, as well as challenges by those two countries and others to elements of the 
U.S.-led international order established after World War II.”  Congressional Resear ch 
Service, R43848, Great Power Competition:  Implications for Defense--Issues for Congress 38 (2024).   Page 6 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  Inc., B-419834.2, B -419834.3, Sept. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 319 at 7.  While the 
protester expresses its opinion that its quotation adequately responded to the 
solicitation, the evaluators found otherwise, and disagreement with the evaluators ’ 
conclusions, without more, provides no reason for us to question the agency ’s 
evaluative judgments.  Id.  Further, although the protester asserts that the two cited 
portions of its quotation address the approach to broad- based cross -collaboration that 
the evaluators determined was missing, Sancorp does not explain how the quotation specified an approach rather than simply reiterating the firm’s claims to experience.   
 Indeed, the only reference to cross -collaboration methods in this part of Sancorp’s 
quotation is not a complete thought:  “Team Sancorp will cooperate across EXDIR support efforts to ensure that contract support.”  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 20.  Nor does the protester identify any flaw in the evaluators’ conclusion 
that Sancorp’s specific discussion of interfacing with the intelligence community did not in fact expressly address similar interaction with the broader universe of stakeholders  as 
required by the solicitation.  Accordingly, we deny the protester ’s challenges to the 
evaluation of a weakness in the firm’s quotation.  See, e.g., CACI, Inc. --Fed. , 
B-420729.2, Mar. 1, 2023, 2023 CPD ¶ 51 at 9 (denying evaluation challenge where the 
protester simply held “ a different opinion from the evaluators about the information in 
[the protester ’s] proposal ”); Innovative M gmt. Concepts, Inc. , supra . 
 Next, the protester contends that the agency should have assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding, rather than good, to Sancorp’s quotation under the technical evaluation factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10.  According to the protester, WHS was obligated to assign a rating of outstanding to Sancorp’s technical quotation because the 
agency had identified multiple strengths --and only a single weakness --during the 
evaluation.  Id.  
 We have consistently stated that the essence of an agency ’s evaluation is reflected in 
the evaluation record itself, not the adjectival ratings.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , 
B-400670.2, B -400670.3, May 28, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 120 at 9.  Moreover, as a general 
matter, adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and not a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Science Applications Int ’l Corp. , B-407105, B -407105.2, 
Nov. 1, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 310 at 9.  The relevant question here is not what adjectival 
rating should have been assigned by the agency, but whether the underlying evaluation is reasonable and supports the source selection decision.  See INDUS Tech., Inc. , 
B-411702 et al. , Sept. 29, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 304 at 4.    
 In support of this challenge, the protester simply quotes the solicitation’s definition of the pertinent adjectival ratings and argues that the strengths assessed to Sancorp’s quotation “clearly aligned with the Outstanding rating criteria in the RFQ, rather than the Good rating that the [evaluators]  assigned Sancorp.”  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10. 
The protester does not otherwise argue why the substance of its quotation merited a higher rating.  In sum, the essence of Sancorp’s challenge is not to the underlying evaluation but to the resulting adjectival rating.  On this record, Sancorp’s disagreement  Page 7 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  with its rating does not provide a basis to conclude that the agency’s evaluation was 
unreasonable.  As such, this challenge is also denied.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , supra.  
  Premier’s Quotation 
 Sancorp also challenges the agency’s evaluation of Premier’s technical quotation for the EXDIR call order.  According to the protester, the agency “missed flaws” --failures to 
comply with material solicitation requirements --in the awardee’s quotation.  Comm ents 
& Supp. Protest at 11- 13.  The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. COS/MOL at 15 -24.  While we do not 
address every assertion raised, we have reviewed all the arguments, and we discuss a representative example below.  
 Among the critical tasks identified for the EXDIR call order was PWS task 5.5 (administrative and human resources support).  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  Under this task, subtask 5.5.2 (executive secretariat support), required records 
management liaison support for the “planning, development, and maintenance of a user-friendly, effective file system compliant with Department regulations.”  AR, 
Tab 11a, EXDIR PWS at 29.  This was to include advising on “digitization” and 
maintaining “paperless  archives.”  Id. 
 Premier’s quotation addressed the administrative and human resources support task, identifying the following “four overarching needs” that shaped the firm’s approach for all work, including electronic records:  technical expertise, systems thinking, emotional intelligence, and reality testing.  AR, Tab 27, Premier Technical Quotations at 15- 16.  
Specific to the executive secretariat support, Premier acknowledges the need for personnel to have “a holistic sense” of the organization and applicable policies and procedures and discusses how it will apply its approach to records management.  Id.  
at 17.   
 The protester contends the awardee’s technical quotation fails to demonstrate “experience in maintaining and posting electronic archives” and does not specifically address National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards for such archives.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13.  The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably found that Premier proposed a comprehensive technical approach to the executive secretariat support work, including electronic archives.  Supp. COS/MOL at 21-22. 
 Here, the record reflects that WHS found that Premier’s quotation met the requirements for this subtask.  AR, Tab 36, Premier EXDIR TEB Report at 5.  According to the evaluators, Premier’s quotation detailed an adequate approach to the work.  Id.  
Although the protester contends that the level of detail provided by Premier was inadequate, nothing in the solicitation required vendors to detail their experience performing similar requirements.  Instead, the RFQ provided that vendors should describe “an effect ive method to accomplish the critical tasks” that evidenced 
understanding of the work required.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  While  Page 8 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  the protester advocates that the task is better addressed by detailing experience and 
specifically naming NARA in its response, that opinion does not demonstrate that the awardee’s approach was deficient with respect to meeting the requirements of the PWS.   Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, B -422823.2, Nov. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD 
¶ 272 at 5 (denying protest alleging that awardee should have received weakness 
where the protester merely disagreed with the agency’s assessment).  
 To the extent the protester’s objection is that the contemporaneous record includes a very limited examination of Premier’s approach to electronic records, our Office has consistently explained that agencies need not document all determinations of adequacy .  
Allied Tech. Grp. , Inc., B -412434, B -412434.2, Feb. 10, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 74 at 13 
(finding an agency is not required to document why a quotation did not receive a weakness for a particular item).  This argument --and the similar arguments Sancorp 
raises about other elements of the awardee’s quotation--are therefore denied.  
 Call Order 2 (SASP)  
 Sancorp also protests the issuance of the SASP call order to Arlo.  The protester challenges multiple elements of the agency’s evaluation of its own quotation and the quotation of the awardee under the technical and past performance evaluation factors, as well as the reasonableness of the best -value tradeoff.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments 
& Supp. Protest at  8-10, 15- 18.   
 After submission of the agency report, the intervenor, Arlo, filed comments along with a request for dismissal of the protest arguments related to the SASP call order.  Arlo 
argues that the protester’s quotation for this call order is technically unacceptable and cannot form the basis for an award because Sancorp knew that one of its proposed key personnel became unavailable after quotations were submitted, but prior to the agency making award.  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 5- 10.  The agency subsequently file d a 
response in support of the intervenor’s request for dismissal.  Supp. COS/MOL at 3- 4.  
For the reasons explained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate.  
  Key Personnel  
 When, as here, a solicitation requires resumes for  key personnel, the resumes form a 
material requirement of the solicitation.  YWCA of Greater Los Angeles , B-414596 et al. , 
July 24, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶  245 at 4.  Offerors are obligated to advise agencies of 
changes in proposed resources to satisfy material requirements, even after submission of proposals  or quotations , including if an individual proposed for a key personnel 
position is no longer available.  Chenega Healthcare Servs., LLC , B-416158, June 4, 
2018, 2018 CPD ¶  200 at  3 n.2.  The duty to notify does not arise, however, if a vendor 
does not have actual knowledge of the employee’s unavailability.  Ashlin Mgmt. Grp. , 
B-419472.3, B -419472.4, Nov. 4, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 357 at 4- 5.  When an agency is 
notified of the withdrawal of a key person, the agency cannot proceed with award to that quotation.  Id.  Instead, the agency has two options:  either reject the quotation  as  Page 9 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  technically unacceptable for failing to meet a material requirement, or open discussions 
with all remaining vendors  to permit proposal revisions.  Id. 
 Here, under the technical factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose individuals for nine key personnel positions including, as relevant here, staff officer (subject matter expert level IV).  RFQ at 87; AR, Tab 11b,  SASP PWS at 5 -6.  Vendors were required to 
submit resumes and letters of commitment for the identified key personnel.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 7- 8. 
 Sancorp proposed an individual who we refer to as “X” for a staff officer key personnel position.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp submitted X’s resume, which explained that X had joined Sancorp in April 2024 and “currently suppor ts OUSD(I&S)” under an incumbent effort.  Id.  Sancorp also submitted a letter of 
commitment signed by X, in which X agreed to work for Sancorp in the key personnel role in the event of award to the firm.  AR, Tab 51, Sancorp BPA Quotation at 12.  The evaluators assigned a strength to Sancorp’s quotation based on X’s qualifications for 
the key personnel role.  AR, Tab 26, Sancorp SASP TEB Report at 11.  Based, in part, on X and the other key personnel, the evaluators assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding to Sancorp’s quotation.  Id. at 2. 
 Citing “public information,” the intervenor asserts that in February 2025, X “left the employment of Sancorp and began working for another company . . . as an Operations Officer/Research Analyst, rendering X unavailable to fill the key position for which Sancorp proposed him.”  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 4.  Our Office directed Sancorp to 
respond to the intervenor’s request for dismissal.  Electronic Protest Docketing System 
No. 38.   
 In its response, Sancorp confirms that X “resigned from Sancorp in February 2025” and provided a copy of X’s letter of resignation, dated February 7, 2025--before the agency issued the SASP call order at issue.  Supp. Comments at 3; exh. B to Supp. Comment s.  
Sancorp nonetheless contends that it did not have an obligation to inform the agency because the firm did not have actual knowledge of X’s unavailability.  Supp. Comments at 2-3.  Indeed, Sancorp argues:  
 
Even where employees have resigned, retired, or otherwise left the contractor who proposed them as key personnel, absent notice that the 
employees were no longer available in case of award, GAO has held that 
no notice to the procuring agency is required.  
 
Id. at 3 (citing DZSP 21, LLC , B-410486.10, Jan. 10, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 155 at 10).  In 
this connection, the protester asserts that X had “left Sancorp amicably.”  Id.   According 
to the protester, because X “left Sancorp on good terms,” only if X affirmatively and specifically withdrew his letter of commitment or otherwise “indicate[d] that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won the award” would Sancorp have had actual 
knowledge of X’s unavailability.  Id.  at 3.  Sancorp hints --without committing --that it 
would successfully rehire X if it received the SASP task order.  Id. (“[X] did not withdraw  Page 10 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  his letter of commitment or indicate that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won 
the award . . . and that letter of commitment remains valid to dat e.”). 
 Our Office has rejected arguments that a firm had actual knowledge of a proposed key individual’s unavailability where, notwithstanding resignation or retirement of key personnel, the protester advanced a credible basis to deny actual knowledge of unavailability.  For example, in Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422118.2, B -422118.3, 
July 30, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 184, we could not conclude that a firm had actual 
knowledge of unavailability of an individual proposed for a key personnel position that was employed by a proposed subcontractor.  There, the firm did not receive direct notification of the individual’s retirement --instead, the subcontractor had separately 
provided reassurance of the continued availability of the individual.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  In other instances, we did not find actual knowledge of 
unavailability where the proposed individuals themselves have reaffirmed their ongoing availability in statements submitted within the protest record.  See, e.g., DKW 
Commc’ns, Inc. , B-414476,  B-414476.2, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 206 at 9 (finding 
firm’s “belief regarding [individual’s] continued availability was a well -founded one, as it 
was based on information provided by [the individual] himself”).  Similarly, in DZSP 21, LLC, we found no “evidence of an affirmative, material misrepresentation” of the 
continued availability of key personnel proposed despite employment changes where documents produced during the protest reflected that (1) the individuals did not advise the offeror of their unavailability (or employment changes); and (2) the individuals “all appear interested in assuming the positions for which they had been proposed.”  DZSP 21, LLC , supra at 11- 12. 
 
By contrast, X was --as touted by Sancorp in its quotation--employed by Sancorp and 
performing on an incumbent effort at the time of quotation submission.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp itself received specific, direct communicat ion of a significant change in X’s circumstances when X resigned his 
position with Sancorp on the incumbent effort while quotations were pending.  Supp. Comments at 2; Supp. Comments, exh. B.  That X had signed a letter of commitment in July 2024 when quot ations were submitted, however, does not immunize Sancorp from 
any knowledge of unavailability, and does not provide a permanent and unrebuttable presumption of continued availability despite a change in circumstances.  See  Booz 
Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  Here, the record reflects that X submitted a letter of 
resignation on February 7 and subsequently left Sancorp’s employ later that month.  Supp. Comments, exh. B at 1 (resignation letter of X stating, “my last official day will be 14 February 2025” ).  Relevant here, the protester has not provided any evidence or 
statement from X, himself, reaffirming his availability or willingness to return to the firm to perform the key position for which he was quoted to perform by Sancorp.  See , DKW 
Commc’ns, Inc. , supra .   Consequently, we find unpersuasive the protester’s argument 
now that Sancorp lacked “actual knowledge” of the employee’s unavailability simply because X did not --after tendering his resignation--also affirmatively withdraw the letter 
of commit ment X had signed months earlier.  See  Ashlin Mgmt. Grp. , supra at 5 
(denying argument that awardee lacked “actual knowledge” of unavailability of individual  Page 11 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  proposed as key personnel --despite individual’s resignation--because individual could 
potentially be rehired).  
 
As our decisions have found, because Sancorp had actual knowledge of the unavailability of X, the protester was obligated to advise the agency of the unavailability of the quoted key person, even after submission of  quotations.  Chenega Healthcare 
Servs., LLC , supra.  Having failed to do so, Sancorp’s quotation was rendered 
unacceptable and therefore, ineligible for award.

 Interested Party  
 
Under the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, only an interested party may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. §§  3551- 3557.  That is, 
a protester must be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract. 4 C.F.R.  § 21.0(a)(1).  In a post -award context, we have generally found that a protester 
is an interested party to challenge an agency ’s evaluation only where there is a 
reasonable possibility that the protester would be next in line for award if its protest 
were sustained.   CACI, Inc. -Fed., B-419499, Mar. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶  125 at 5.   A 
protester is therefore not an interested party if it would not be eligible to receive a contract award were its protest to be sustained.  Win Aviation, Inc. , B-422037, 
B-422037.2, Dec. 21, 2023, 2024 CPD ¶  12 at 6.

Paragon Sys., Inc. , B-422828, B -422828.2, Nov. 19, 2024, 2024 CPD ¶ 283 at 10.  
Where, as here, the record reflects that the protester’s quotation for the SASP call order 
was unacceptable, Sancorp does not qualify as an interested party to challenge other aspects of the agency’s evaluation and selection decision with respect to the issuance of the SASP call order.  Orion Gov’t Servs., supra at 7.  The challenges to the SASP call 
order are therefore dismissed.  
 The protest is denied.

government employees in the executive branch, based on a presidential memorandum and subsequent guidance.   ManTech also complains that the agency misevaluated its 
quotation under two evaluation factors.      We dismiss the protest in part and deny it in part.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the agency issued the RFQ to vendors holding General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contracts under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  See  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 
(RFQ).
2  The solicitation sought quotations to provide agile teams, each comprised of 
three to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the 
FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS).3  The RFQ contemplated 
issuance of five task orders (collectively referred to as “FBI Agility with SAFe Teams” or 
“FAST”) --one task order for each of five areas within the FBI’s CJIS that are supported 
by this procurement; each task order was identified by  a separate contract line item 
number (CLIN).4  This protest concerns only the task order issued under CLIN 2, 
biometric services.  RFQ  at 5.  The period of performance for the task order includes a 
base period of one year (including a 3- month transition period) and four 12- month 
option periods.  Id.  at 16.

2 The agency  has amended the RFQ  thirteen times.  References to the RFQ are to the 
final conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All 
citations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this 
decision.  
3 The RFQ explains that an agile team is a “cross -functional group of individuals who 
define, build, test, and deliver an increment of value,” and that these teams will apply a “Scaled Agile Framework ” (SAFe), which is “an enterprise agility framework that helps 
organizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.”  RFQ at  4-5. 
4 The five CLINs were for:  (1) law enforcement support services; (2) biometric services; 
(3) National Crime Information Center; (4) shared services; and (5) operational programs.  The agency states that CLIN  4 has been canceled.  Contracting Officer’s 
Statement (COS) at  1 n.1.   Page 3 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, using a 
three- phase advisory down- selection process under which the agency would evaluate 
quotations under the following evaluation factors:  phase one (facility clearance; 
corporate experience; staffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology 
demonstration); and phase three (price).5  The RFP further provided that, with the 
exception of the facility clearance factor (which would be rated on a pass/fail basis), each non- price factor would be assigned a confidence rating of high confidence, some 
confidence, or low confidence.
6  Finally, the RFQ provided that, following its evaluation 
of quotations in phase one and phase two, the agency would provide an advisory notice to each vendor reflecting the agency’s recommendation as to whether the vendor should proceed to the next phase.  Id. at 62-63.  The RFQ noted that the purpose of the 
advisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id. 
 In early 2024, the agency received quotations from several vendors including ManTech and Leidos.  During phase one, the agency conducted discussions and provided evaluation notices to ManTech, identifying various aspects of ManTech’s quotation that decreas ed the agency’s confidence under the non- price evaluation factors.  Following 
ManTech’s submission of a revised quotation, the agency provided ManTech with a phase one advisory notice, stating that “ManTech is not  among the most highly rated 
and the likeli hood of ManTech receiving the award against CLIN 2 is very low.”  AR, 
Tab 7-1, Phase One Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Nonetheless, ManTech elected 
to proceed and submitted a phase two quotation.  At the conclusion of the phase two evaluation, the agency again provided ManTech with an advisory notice stating that 
ManTech’s quotation was not among the most highly rated and was not likely to receive 
award.  AR, Tab 7-2, Phase Two Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Again, ManTech 
elected to proceed and submitted a phase three quotation.    On September 20, 2024, the agency selected Leidos for award; thereafter, ManTech 
filed a protest with our Office.  In response, the agency stated that it would take corrective action, to include reevaluating quotations and making a new award decision; acco rdingly, we dismissed the protest.  ManTech Adv anced Sys. Int’l, Inc. , 
B-421560.12, supra.  
 
5 The RFQ provided that phase one is more important than phase two; phase two is 
more important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become more similar in 
nature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important in the best -
value t radeoff decision.  RFQ at 61.    
6 Of relevance here, the solicitation defined a “high confidence” rating as reflecting a 
quotation that demonstrated understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with “little or no” government intervention.  The solici tation 
defined a “some confidence” rating as applicable to a quotation that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with “some” government intervention.  RFQ at 67.    Page 4 B-421560.14; B -421560.16   
Thereafter, the agency reviewed its evaluation of ManTech’s and Leidos’s quotations,7 
and documented its rationale for assignment of the following ratings:   
 
 ManTech  Leidos  
Corporate Experience  Some Confidence  High Confidence  
Staffing Approach  Some Confidence  High Confidence  
Demonstration  Low Confidence  High Confidence  
Total Evaluated Price  $128,467,487  $137,696,324  
Price Complete, Reasonable, and 
Realistic  Yes Yes 
 AR, Tab  8, Basis of Award at  8. 
 In assessing ratings of some confidence to ManTech’s quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors, and low confidence under the demonstration factor, the agency identified multiple aspects of ManTech’s quotation that decreased the agency’s confidence in ManTech’s successful task order performance.  For example, with regard to the corporate experience factor, the agency concluded that ManTech’s quotation “lacked details,” provided “no examples of actually utilizing SAFe Agile processes,” and “did not demonstrate a mature understanding of the SAFe 
framework.”
8  Id. at 9.  With regard to staffing approach, the agency noted, among other 
things, that ManTech’s quotation “lacked the SAFe specific detail (not just buzz words)” and “merely placed SAFe terminology on an already existing process.”  Id. at 11.  The 
agency further noted that ManTech’s quotation “focus[ed] on incumbent capture for the first [redacted]  days [of the transition period]” and “[did not] outline[] recruitment 
activities [for external hires]” until the last  [redacted]  days of the transition period, 
describing this as a “reactive approach to staffing and transition which introduces significant risk.”
9  Id.  Finally, in assigning a low confidence rating under the 
 
7 After numerous protests and corrective actions, ManTech and Leidos were the only 
two companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  2 task order.  AR, Tab 8, 
Basis of Award at  2-3.  Both vendors passed the facility clearance factor, which, as 
noted above, was evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Id.  at 4. 
8 To demonstrate corporate experience, the RFQ required vendors to submit 
information for three contracts that “are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this RFQ and corresponding CLIN,” and “provide clear evidence that the Quoter delivered systems or solutions to an external customer utilizing the SAFe framework.”  RFQ at  54. 
9 For the staffing approach factor, the RFQ required vendors to provide a “detailed 
rationale for how its quoted staffing approach meets the [task order] requirements” and to “include the Quoter’s methodologies and capabilities to recruit and retain employees for this effort.”  RFQ at 54.  More specifically, the RFQ stated:  “If the Quoter’s transition 
(continued...)   Page 5 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  demonstration factor, the agency concluded, among other things, that ManTech “failed 
to provide an actual demonstration of an 8- 12 week prototype as required.”10  Id. at 13.   
 Overall, the agency’s evaluation authority considered and compared the quotations, concluding:  “Even though ManTech’s solution is lower priced, the Government 
determined the lower price is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach 
and ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.”  Id.  at 15. 
 
On January 24, 2025, the agency again selected Leidos for award, notified ManTech of 
its decision, and provided a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 9, Unsuccessful Vendor Notice 
at 1-2.  This protest followed.
  
 DISCUSSION  As noted above, ManTech asserts that the terms of the solicitation no longer reflect the agency’s requirements and should be amended, and that the agency improperly assigned ratings of only “some confidence” to ManTech’s quotation under the corporate exper ience and staffing approach evaluation factors.  As discussed below, we dismiss 
ManTech’s challenge to the terms of the solicitation, and we deny its allegations regarding the evaluation of its quotation.
11 
 Terms of Solicitation  
 
We first address ManTech’s assertion that the terms of the solicitation fail to reflect the 
agency’s actual needs.  Specifically, ManTech refers to the issuance of a presidential 
memorandum dated January 20, 2025, along with subsequent guidance from the Of fice 
of Personnel Management, which addresses return to in- person work requirements for 
federal government employees in the executive branch.
12  ManTech asserts that these 
 
approach is ‘incumbent capture,’ the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if 
incumbent capture is not successful.”  Id. at 55; see also id. at 8-9 (staffing and 
transition staffing requirements).  The RFQ provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor’s approach.  Id.  at 64. 
10  In its protest, ManTech initially asserted that its quotation should have been rated 
higher under each of these three evaluation factors --but subsequently withdrew its 
protest regarding the low confidence rating it received under the demonstration factor .  
Supp. Comments at  2 n.2.    
11 In its various protest submissions, ManTech raises arguments that are in addition to, 
or variations of, those specifically discussed below.  We have considered all of ManTech’s arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  
12 The full text of the presidential memorandum states:  “Heads of all departments and 
agencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in -person at their respective duty stations on a full -time basis, provided 
(continued...)   Page 6 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  actions “drastically altered” the agency’s requirements for this procurement and, 
accordingly, asserts that the agency was required to amend the solicitation--and allow offerors to submit revised quotations.  Protest at 21.   
   
ManTech acknowledges that the return to in- person work requirements do not apply to 
contractors, see Protest at 22 n.8, and ManTech’s protest does not identify any 
particular contract performance requirement that will be altered by the presidential memorandum.  Nonetheless, referencing its contract performance prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, ManTech makes the general assertion that coordination between 
contractor and government personnel “is best accomplished by co- locating the 
members of these teams --both federal and contractor alike--at the FBI’s facility in 
Clarksburg, [West Virginia] . . . which the Agency will be required to consider when implementing its in- office policies.”  Id. at 22.   
 In response to this allegation, the agency first states that it did, in fact, consider place of performance requirements when drafting the RFQ, and established on- site 
requirements for certain contractor personnel.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see RFQ 
at 15.  The agency further points out that ManTech’s protest fails to identify any 
particular contract performance requirement that will be materially altered by the return to in-person work requirement for government personnel.  Finally, the agency notes that 
the solicitation expressly provides that the agency may subsequently change work locations for contractor personnel where appropriate.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see 
RFQ at  15.  Accordingly, the agency maintains that ManTech’s general assertion of 
changed contractor requirements that allegedly flow from the presidential memorandum, without more, is insufficient to form a valid basis for protest.  We agree.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations provide that a protest must include a detailed statement of 
the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4), 21.1(f), and 21.5(f).  These requirements contemplate 
that a protester will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if 
uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  Midwest Tube Fabricators, Inc. , B-407166, B -407167, Nov. 20, 
2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 324 at 3.  
 Here, ManTech’s general assertion that in- person work requirements for federal 
employees will impact the contract requirements --without identification of any particular 
material impact on the contract requirements and contractor’s performance--fails to meet the required standard.  First, as discussed above, the solicitation incorporates the agency’s consideration of on- site performance requirements for certain contractor 
personnel, and further provides that the agency may change work location requirements for contractor personnel as appropriate.  Second, ManTech’s protest fails to 
meaningfully address how the executive actions will affect this task order’s requirements 
 
that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.”  Presidential Memorandum, Return to In -Person Work , 90 Fed. Reg. 8251 (Jan.  28, 2025).   Page 7 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  to acquire agile teams for the delivery of digital and information technology services to 
the FBI’s CJIS; rather, ManTech’s allegation rests entirely on its purported belief that co-location is the “best” way to perform the work.  Protest at  22.  Finally, as the agency 
points out and ManTech acknowledges, the presidential memorandum and accompanying guidance address remote work arrangements for federal government employees in the executive branch; neither “references contractors or contractor performance at  all.”  Req. for Dismissal at  3. 
 In short, ManTech has failed to identify the specific circumstances presented by the presidential memorandum --in the context of this procurement --that could be construed 
to constitute “a material departure from the assumptions set forth in the solicitation.”  See Chronos Sols. , LLC,  et al. , B-417870.2 et al. , Oct. 1, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  395 at  14 
(sustaining protest where agency did not consider significant changes in the law, as well as agency’s policies and market conditions, directly applicable to the subject matter of the procurement).  On this record, ManTech’s allegation is insufficient and is dismissed.    Evaluation Challenges  
 Next, ManTech challenges the agency’s evaluation of its quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors.
13  Based on these alleged 
evaluation errors, ManTech also challenges the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision.  
 
Corporate Experience Factor  
 
For the corporate experience factor, the agency assigned ManTech a rating of “some 
confidence” and found four aspects of the quotation that decreased the agency’s 
confidence in ManTech’s successful performance of the task order.  ManTech’s protest 
expresses its disagreement with each of the four assessments.   
 For example, with regard to ManTech’s third example of its prior experience, the agency 
concluded that, even following discussions, ManTech’s quotation failed to reflect 
experience that was “similar in size and scope” to the task order requirements.
14  AR, 
Tab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at 5.  More specifically, the 
agency noted a lack of detail in the quotation’s description of prior tasks, stating that the prior effort appeared to be “more of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) effort rather 
 
13 As noted above, ManTech initially challenged--and subsequently withdrew --its 
challenge to the agency’s assignment of a low confidence rating under the demonstration evaluation factor.  See Supp. Comments at 2 n.2.  
14 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to submit information for three contracts 
that “are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity” to the solicitation requirements.  RFQ at  54.  Page 8 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  than a combination of development, test, integration and O&M”.15  Id.  In this context, 
ManTech expresses its disagreement with the agency’s assessments, maintaining that 
its revised quotation “provided specific details” and asserting that the agency’s evaluation was “unreasonable.”  Protest at  28-29.  Alternatively, ManTec h asserts that 
the agency’s discussions were “inadequate and misleading” because, in ManTech’s 
view, “it is inexplicable how the Agency could have maintained those criticisms to begin 
with in the face of the revisions to ManTech’s proposal.”  Supp. Comments at  2; Protest 
at 28. 
 
The agency responds that it properly concluded, following discussions, that ManTech’s 
revised quotation continued to contain inadequate detail to demonstrate that the prior 
effort encompassed the scope of the required activities, reiterating its view that 
ManTech’s description of the prior effort reflected primarily O&M activities.  COS at 11.  More specifically, the agency provides a list of task descriptions drawn from ManTech’s quotation, stating:   
 
ManTech provided the below tasks performed in [its prior contract] which were the bulk of tasks and are clearly O&M activities.  Examples of O&M include . . . training, monitoring administration, and operational support which often requires development of upgrade/enhancements to current system function, development of dashboards to monitor performance, security, workflow, etc. for system and subsystem components reports, and deployment of a developed system.   
 Id.  In short, the agency maintains that, based on the specific examples drawn from 
ManTech’s revised quotation, the agency reasonably concluded that the prior effort was “largely O&M experience and fail[s] to meet the solicitation requirements.”  Id.   
 In responding to ManTech’s complaint regarding the adequacy of discussions, the agency notes that one of the four evaluation notices provided to ManTech contained the following statements:  
 
[ManTech’s quotation regarding] corporate experience failed to demonstrate . . . a mature understanding of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles and practices which would require some Government intervention to successfully deliver the requirements.  
 
    *     *     *     *     * 
[The prior contract] was more of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) example rather than the development, test, integration and O&M requirements of the [task order at issue].   
 
 
15 The task order requirements “[are] comprised of four key areas[:]  development, 
testing, integration and O&M.”  AR, Tab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation at 5; see RFQ 
at 4-10; see generally  AR, Tab 3- 2, RFQ attach. 2, Statement of Work.     Page 9 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  See AR, Tab 4 -1, Evaluation Notice at 1, 3.  In this regard, the agency argues that it 
properly and sufficiently advised ManTech of its concerns.  Supp. MOL at  7-8. 
 
Where, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our Office 
will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 58 
at 8.  A protester’s disagreement with a procuring agency’s evaluation judgments, 
witho ut more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  DEI Consulting , 
B-401258, July 13, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 151 at  2.   
 Further, where, as here,  a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, there 
is no requirement for agencies to conduct discussions in accordance with FAR  section 
15.306.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in FAR part 8 procurements, 
like all other aspects of such procurements, must be fair and equitable.  USGC Inc. , 
B-400184.2 et al. , Dec.  24, 2008, 2009 CPD ¶ 9 at 3.  When an agency engages in 
discussions with an offeror, the discussions must be “meaningful,” that is, sufficiently detailed so as to lead an offeror into the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or 
revision.  See  FAR 15.306(d)(3); Southeastern Kidney Council , B-412538, Mar. 17, 
2016, 2016 CPD ¶  90 at 4.  Agencies, however, are not required to “spoon- feed” an 
offeror during discussions by identifying every possible area where a proposal might be improved or suggesting alternative approaches.  Vizada Inc. , B-405251 et al. , Oct. 5, 
2011, 2011 CPD ¶  235 at  11. 
 
Here, the record shows that, following discussions, ManTech revised its quotation by inserting the words “development, test, integration, and operations support,” deleting one task that used the word “O&M,” and adding several tasks descriptions.  AR, Tab 5-1, ManTech Phase One Quotation at  12; see also Comments and Supp. Protest 
at 9 (showing track changes).  After evaluating ManTech’s revised quotation, the 
agency found that its concerns were not resolved and identified this as a decreased confidence area.   AR, Tab  6-1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at  5.  As 
the contracting officer explains, the information added to ManTech’s quotation was still “clearly O&M activit[y]” and failed to meet the solicitation’s requirements to address the various  elements of SAFe framework.  COS at 11.  
 Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation of ManTech’s quotation under the corporate experience factor or the adequacy of the discussions.  In revising its quotation, ManTech inserted various words and deleted the task that specifically referenced O&M --but, in evaluating the revised quotation, the 
agency considered the entirety of the quotation and found that it still did not address development, test, integration and O&M.  In our view, the agency reasonably concluded that ManTech’s revised quotation still failed to meaningfully address the solicitation requirements and the agency’s concerns raised during discussions.  Moreover, the plain language of the agency’s evaluation notice identified the aspects of ManTec h’s 
quotation that needed to be addressed to include the agency’s express concern that  Page 10 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  ManTech’s experience reflected O&M work rather than the broader requirement s of the 
task order.  ManTech’s various expressions of disagreement, without more, are 
insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  
 
Staffing Approach Factor  
 For the staffing approach factor, the agency assigned ManTech’s quotation a rating of “some confidence,” and found six areas that decreased the agency’s confidence in ManTech’s successful task order performance.  ManTech’s protest expresses its disagreement with each of the assessments.   
 For example, the agency criticized ManTech’s focus on hiring of incumbent staff at the beginning of the transition period, and its failure to begin recruiting external hires until after the first [redacted]  days, describing this as a “reactive approach to staffing and 
transition that introduces significant risk.”
16  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 11; see AR 
Tab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing Approach) at 3- 4.  ManTech acknowledges 
that its quotation stated that, following the first [redacted] days of the transition period, 
ManTech would “[c]onduct internal and external hiring and outreach events (if needed),” see AR, Tab 5- 1, ManTech Quotation at 22, but nonetheless, asserts that the agency’s 
concern was “unreasonable.”  Protest at 31.  
 The agency defends its assessment on the basis that ManTech’s quotation indicated it would delay recruitment activities for external hires until after the first portion of the transition period had passed, concluding that ManTech’s focus on incumbent capture 
rather than “simultaneously” conducting external recruitment activities created risk that 
could “disrupt work.”  COS at 13- 14; see AR, Tab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing 
Approach) at 3- 4.  More specifically, the agency notes that ManTech’s delayed 
approach to recruiting external hires could “create a security backlog and place a significant strain on the onboarding process.”  COS at 13- 14. 
 As noted above, our Office will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s 
evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , supra.   
 
Here, ManTech acknowledges the agency’s “correct” reading of its quotation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  10-11.  While ManTech contends that the agency 
“ignored” other “pre- transition recruitment activities” in its quotation, id. , the protester 
does not explain how this addressed the RFQ’s transition requirements or mitigated the 
 
16 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to discuss their proposed “methodologies 
and capabilities to recruit and retain employees”; stated that “[i]f the Quoter’s transition approach is ‘incumbent capture’, the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if incumbent capture is not successful”; and provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor’s approach.  RFQ at 54- 55, 64.   Page 11 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  agency’s concerns about recruiting delays during transition.  For example, ManTech’s 
quotation indicated it had [redacted] , but these activities were limited to the time period 
leading up to a possible task order award and not during transition.  See  AR, Tab  5-1, 
ManTech Phase One Quotation at  21.  These aspects of the quotation do not address 
ManTech’s decision to wait until [redacted]  days into the transition period to address 
staffing if incumbent capture was not successful.  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s concerns regarding the potential risks associated with ManTech’s staffing approach.  This protest ground is denied.  
 Best-Value Tradeoff Decision  
 
Finally, ManTech challenges the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision “based upon an 
improper evaluation.”  Protest at 37.  To the extent this complaint is based on 
ManTech’s various allegations that we have rejected, the protest fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See , e.g., CORE O’Ahu, LLC, B -421714, B -421714.2, Aug. 31, 2022, 
2023 CPD ¶ 212 at 11.  In any event, the record shows that the agency considered the detailed evaluation documentation, compared the competing quotations, and concluded:  “Even though ManTech’s solution is lower priced, the Government determined the lower 
price is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach and ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.”  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award 
at 15.  O n the record here, ManTech has not established that the agency’s best -value 
tradeoff decision was flawed.  
 
The protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest alleging that agency was required to amend the solicitation in response to changing requirements for federal government employees in the executive branch, based on a presidential memorandum and subsequent guidance, is dismissed for failure to state a valid basis of protest.  
 2.  Protest challenging various aspects of the agency’s evaluation of the protester’s quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach factors, and the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision based on those alleged evaluation errors, is 
denied where the evaluation and best -value tradeoff decision were reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation.

  Page 2 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  requirements and should be amended to address changing requirements for federal 
government employees in the executive branch, based on a presidential memorandum and subsequent guidance.   ManTech also complains that the agency misevaluated its 
quotation under two evaluation factors.      We dismiss the protest in part and deny it in part.  
 BACKGROUND  
 On August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the agency issued the RFQ to vendors holding General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contracts under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  See  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 
(RFQ).
2  The solicitation sought quotations to provide agile teams, each comprised of 
three to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the 
FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS).3  The RFQ contemplated 
issuance of five task orders (collectively referred to as “FBI Agility with SAFe Teams” or 
“FAST”) --one task order for each of five areas within the FBI’s CJIS that are supported 
by this procurement; each task order was identified by  a separate contract line item 
number (CLIN).4  This protest concerns only the task order issued under CLIN 2, 
biometric services.  RFQ  at 5.  The period of performance for the task order includes a 
base period of one year (including a 3- month transition period) and four 12- month 
option periods.  Id.  at 16.

2 The agency  has amended the RFQ  thirteen times.  References to the RFQ are to the 
final conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All 
citations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this 
decision.  
3 The RFQ explains that an agile team is a “cross -functional group of individuals who 
define, build, test, and deliver an increment of value,” and that these teams will apply a “Scaled Agile Framework ” (SAFe), which is “an enterprise agility framework that helps 
organizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.”  RFQ at  4-5. 
4 The five CLINs were for:  (1) law enforcement support services; (2) biometric services; 
(3) National Crime Information Center; (4) shared services; and (5) operational programs.  The agency states that CLIN  4 has been canceled.  Contracting Officer’s 
Statement (COS) at  1 n.1.   Page 3 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, using a 
three- phase advisory down- selection process under which the agency would evaluate 
quotations under the following evaluation factors:  phase one (facility clearance; 
corporate experience; staffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology 
demonstration); and phase three (price).5  The RFP further provided that, with the 
exception of the facility clearance factor (which would be rated on a pass/fail basis), each non- price factor would be assigned a confidence rating of high confidence, some 
confidence, or low confidence.
6  Finally, the RFQ provided that, following its evaluation 
of quotations in phase one and phase two, the agency would provide an advisory notice to each vendor reflecting the agency’s recommendation as to whether the vendor should proceed to the next phase.  Id. at 62-63.  The RFQ noted that the purpose of the 
advisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id. 
 In early 2024, the agency received quotations from several vendors including ManTech and Leidos.  During phase one, the agency conducted discussions and provided evaluation notices to ManTech, identifying various aspects of ManTech’s quotation that decreas ed the agency’s confidence under the non- price evaluation factors.  Following 
ManTech’s submission of a revised quotation, the agency provided ManTech with a phase one advisory notice, stating that “ManTech is not  among the most highly rated 
and the likeli hood of ManTech receiving the award against CLIN 2 is very low.”  AR, 
Tab 7-1, Phase One Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Nonetheless, ManTech elected 
to proceed and submitted a phase two quotation.  At the conclusion of the phase two evaluation, the agency again provided ManTech with an advisory notice stating that 
ManTech’s quotation was not among the most highly rated and was not likely to receive 
award.  AR, Tab 7-2, Phase Two Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Again, ManTech 
elected to proceed and submitted a phase three quotation.    On September 20, 2024, the agency selected Leidos for award; thereafter, ManTech 
filed a protest with our Office.  In response, the agency stated that it would take corrective action, to include reevaluating quotations and making a new award decision; acco rdingly, we dismissed the protest.  ManTech Adv anced Sys. Int’l, Inc. , 
B-421560.12, supra.  
 
5 The RFQ provided that phase one is more important than phase two; phase two is 
more important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become more similar in 
nature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important in the best -
value t radeoff decision.  RFQ at 61.    
6 Of relevance here, the solicitation defined a “high confidence” rating as reflecting a 
quotation that demonstrated understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with “little or no” government intervention.  The solici tation 
defined a “some confidence” rating as applicable to a quotation that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with “some” government intervention.  RFQ at 67.    Page 4 B-421560.14; B -421560.16   
Thereafter, the agency reviewed its evaluation of ManTech’s and Leidos’s quotations,7 
and documented its rationale for assignment of the following ratings:   
 
 ManTech  Leidos  
Corporate Experience  Some Confidence  High Confidence  
Staffing Approach  Some Confidence  High Confidence  
Demonstration  Low Confidence  High Confidence  
Total Evaluated Price  $128,467,487  $137,696,324  
Price Complete, Reasonable, and 
Realistic  Yes Yes 
 AR, Tab  8, Basis of Award at  8. 
 In assessing ratings of some confidence to ManTech’s quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors, and low confidence under the demonstration factor, the agency identified multiple aspects of ManTech’s quotation that decreased the agency’s confidence in ManTech’s successful task order performance.  For example, with regard to the corporate experience factor, the agency concluded that ManTech’s quotation “lacked details,” provided “no examples of actually utilizing SAFe Agile processes,” and “did not demonstrate a mature understanding of the SAFe 
framework.”
8  Id. at 9.  With regard to staffing approach, the agency noted, among other 
things, that ManTech’s quotation “lacked the SAFe specific detail (not just buzz words)” and “merely placed SAFe terminology on an already existing process.”  Id. at 11.  The 
agency further noted that ManTech’s quotation “focus[ed] on incumbent capture for the first [redacted]  days [of the transition period]” and “[did not] outline[] recruitment 
activities [for external hires]” until the last  [redacted]  days of the transition period, 
describing this as a “reactive approach to staffing and transition which introduces significant risk.”
9  Id.  Finally, in assigning a low confidence rating under the 
 
7 After numerous protests and corrective actions, ManTech and Leidos were the only 
two companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  2 task order.  AR, Tab 8, 
Basis of Award at  2-3.  Both vendors passed the facility clearance factor, which, as 
noted above, was evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Id.  at 4. 
8 To demonstrate corporate experience, the RFQ required vendors to submit 
information for three contracts that “are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this RFQ and corresponding CLIN,” and “provide clear evidence that the Quoter delivered systems or solutions to an external customer utilizing the SAFe framework.”  RFQ at  54. 
9 For the staffing approach factor, the RFQ required vendors to provide a “detailed 
rationale for how its quoted staffing approach meets the [task order] requirements” and to “include the Quoter’s methodologies and capabilities to recruit and retain employees for this effort.”  RFQ at 54.  More specifically, the RFQ stated:  “If the Quoter’s transition 
(continued...)   Page 5 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  demonstration factor, the agency concluded, among other things, that ManTech “failed 
to provide an actual demonstration of an 8- 12 week prototype as required.”10  Id. at 13.   
 Overall, the agency’s evaluation authority considered and compared the quotations, concluding:  “Even though ManTech’s solution is lower priced, the Government 
determined the lower price is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach 
and ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.”  Id.  at 15. 
 
On January 24, 2025, the agency again selected Leidos for award, notified ManTech of 
its decision, and provided a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 9, Unsuccessful Vendor Notice 
at 1-2.  This protest followed.
  
 DISCUSSION  As noted above, ManTech asserts that the terms of the solicitation no longer reflect the agency’s requirements and should be amended, and that the agency improperly assigned ratings of only “some confidence” to ManTech’s quotation under the corporate exper ience and staffing approach evaluation factors.  As discussed below, we dismiss 
ManTech’s challenge to the terms of the solicitation, and we deny its allegations regarding the evaluation of its quotation.
11 
 Terms of Solicitation  
 
We first address ManTech’s assertion that the terms of the solicitation fail to reflect the 
agency’s actual needs.  Specifically, ManTech refers to the issuance of a presidential 
memorandum dated January 20, 2025, along with subsequent guidance from the Of fice 
of Personnel Management, which addresses return to in- person work requirements for 
federal government employees in the executive branch.
12  ManTech asserts that these 
 
approach is ‘incumbent capture,’ the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if 
incumbent capture is not successful.”  Id. at 55; see also id. at 8-9 (staffing and 
transition staffing requirements).  The RFQ provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor’s approach.  Id.  at 64. 
10  In its protest, ManTech initially asserted that its quotation should have been rated 
higher under each of these three evaluation factors --but subsequently withdrew its 
protest regarding the low confidence rating it received under the demonstration factor .  
Supp. Comments at  2 n.2.    
11 In its various protest submissions, ManTech raises arguments that are in addition to, 
or variations of, those specifically discussed below.  We have considered all of ManTech’s arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  
12 The full text of the presidential memorandum states:  “Heads of all departments and 
agencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in -person at their respective duty stations on a full -time basis, provided 
(continued...)   Page 6 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  actions “drastically altered” the agency’s requirements for this procurement and, 
accordingly, asserts that the agency was required to amend the solicitation--and allow offerors to submit revised quotations.  Protest at 21.   
   
ManTech acknowledges that the return to in- person work requirements do not apply to 
contractors, see Protest at 22 n.8, and ManTech’s protest does not identify any 
particular contract performance requirement that will be altered by the presidential memorandum.  Nonetheless, referencing its contract performance prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, ManTech makes the general assertion that coordination between 
contractor and government personnel “is best accomplished by co- locating the 
members of these teams --both federal and contractor alike--at the FBI’s facility in 
Clarksburg, [West Virginia] . . . which the Agency will be required to consider when implementing its in- office policies.”  Id. at 22.   
 In response to this allegation, the agency first states that it did, in fact, consider place of performance requirements when drafting the RFQ, and established on- site 
requirements for certain contractor personnel.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see RFQ 
at 15.  The agency further points out that ManTech’s protest fails to identify any 
particular contract performance requirement that will be materially altered by the return to in-person work requirement for government personnel.  Finally, the agency notes that 
the solicitation expressly provides that the agency may subsequently change work locations for contractor personnel where appropriate.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see 
RFQ at  15.  Accordingly, the agency maintains that ManTech’s general assertion of 
changed contractor requirements that allegedly flow from the presidential memorandum, without more, is insufficient to form a valid basis for protest.  We agree.  
 Our Bid Protest Regulations provide that a protest must include a detailed statement of 
the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.1(c)(4), 21.1(f), and 21.5(f).  These requirements contemplate 
that a protester will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if 
uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  Midwest Tube Fabricators, Inc. , B-407166, B -407167, Nov. 20, 
2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 324 at 3.  
 Here, ManTech’s general assertion that in- person work requirements for federal 
employees will impact the contract requirements --without identification of any particular 
material impact on the contract requirements and contractor’s performance--fails to meet the required standard.  First, as discussed above, the solicitation incorporates the agency’s consideration of on- site performance requirements for certain contractor 
personnel, and further provides that the agency may change work location requirements for contractor personnel as appropriate.  Second, ManTech’s protest fails to 
meaningfully address how the executive actions will affect this task order’s requirements 
 
that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.”  Presidential Memorandum, Return to In -Person Work , 90 Fed. Reg. 8251 (Jan.  28, 2025).   Page 7 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  to acquire agile teams for the delivery of digital and information technology services to 
the FBI’s CJIS; rather, ManTech’s allegation rests entirely on its purported belief that co-location is the “best” way to perform the work.  Protest at  22.  Finally, as the agency 
points out and ManTech acknowledges, the presidential memorandum and accompanying guidance address remote work arrangements for federal government employees in the executive branch; neither “references contractors or contractor performance at  all.”  Req. for Dismissal at  3. 
 In short, ManTech has failed to identify the specific circumstances presented by the presidential memorandum --in the context of this procurement --that could be construed 
to constitute “a material departure from the assumptions set forth in the solicitation.”  See Chronos Sols. , LLC,  et al. , B-417870.2 et al. , Oct. 1, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶  395 at  14 
(sustaining protest where agency did not consider significant changes in the law, as well as agency’s policies and market conditions, directly applicable to the subject matter of the procurement).  On this record, ManTech’s allegation is insufficient and is dismissed.    Evaluation Challenges  
 Next, ManTech challenges the agency’s evaluation of its quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors.
13  Based on these alleged 
evaluation errors, ManTech also challenges the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision.  
 
Corporate Experience Factor  
 
For the corporate experience factor, the agency assigned ManTech a rating of “some 
confidence” and found four aspects of the quotation that decreased the agency’s 
confidence in ManTech’s successful performance of the task order.  ManTech’s protest 
expresses its disagreement with each of the four assessments.   
 For example, with regard to ManTech’s third example of its prior experience, the agency 
concluded that, even following discussions, ManTech’s quotation failed to reflect 
experience that was “similar in size and scope” to the task order requirements.
14  AR, 
Tab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at 5.  More specifically, the 
agency noted a lack of detail in the quotation’s description of prior tasks, stating that the prior effort appeared to be “more of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) effort rather 
 
13 As noted above, ManTech initially challenged--and subsequently withdrew --its 
challenge to the agency’s assignment of a low confidence rating under the demonstration evaluation factor.  See Supp. Comments at 2 n.2.  
14 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to submit information for three contracts 
that “are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity” to the solicitation requirements.  RFQ at  54.  Page 8 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  than a combination of development, test, integration and O&M”.15  Id.  In this context, 
ManTech expresses its disagreement with the agency’s assessments, maintaining that 
its revised quotation “provided specific details” and asserting that the agency’s evaluation was “unreasonable.”  Protest at  28-29.  Alternatively, ManTec h asserts that 
the agency’s discussions were “inadequate and misleading” because, in ManTech’s 
view, “it is inexplicable how the Agency could have maintained those criticisms to begin 
with in the face of the revisions to ManTech’s proposal.”  Supp. Comments at  2; Protest 
at 28. 
 
The agency responds that it properly concluded, following discussions, that ManTech’s 
revised quotation continued to contain inadequate detail to demonstrate that the prior 
effort encompassed the scope of the required activities, reiterating its view that 
ManTech’s description of the prior effort reflected primarily O&M activities.  COS at 11.  More specifically, the agency provides a list of task descriptions drawn from ManTech’s quotation, stating:   
 
ManTech provided the below tasks performed in [its prior contract] which were the bulk of tasks and are clearly O&M activities.  Examples of O&M include . . . training, monitoring administration, and operational support which often requires development of upgrade/enhancements to current system function, development of dashboards to monitor performance, security, workflow, etc. for system and subsystem components reports, and deployment of a developed system.   
 Id.  In short, the agency maintains that, based on the specific examples drawn from 
ManTech’s revised quotation, the agency reasonably concluded that the prior effort was “largely O&M experience and fail[s] to meet the solicitation requirements.”  Id.   
 In responding to ManTech’s complaint regarding the adequacy of discussions, the agency notes that one of the four evaluation notices provided to ManTech contained the following statements:  
 
[ManTech’s quotation regarding] corporate experience failed to demonstrate . . . a mature understanding of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles and practices which would require some Government intervention to successfully deliver the requirements.  
 
    *     *     *     *     * 
[The prior contract] was more of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) example rather than the development, test, integration and O&M requirements of the [task order at issue].   
 
 
15 The task order requirements “[are] comprised of four key areas[:]  development, 
testing, integration and O&M.”  AR, Tab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation at 5; see RFQ 
at 4-10; see generally  AR, Tab 3- 2, RFQ attach. 2, Statement of Work.     Page 9 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  See AR, Tab 4 -1, Evaluation Notice at 1, 3.  In this regard, the agency argues that it 
properly and sufficiently advised ManTech of its concerns.  Supp. MOL at  7-8. 
 
Where, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our Office 
will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and 
consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 58 
at 8.  A protester’s disagreement with a procuring agency’s evaluation judgments, 
witho ut more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  DEI Consulting , 
B-401258, July 13, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 151 at  2.   
 Further, where, as here,  a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, there 
is no requirement for agencies to conduct discussions in accordance with FAR  section 
15.306.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in FAR part 8 procurements, 
like all other aspects of such procurements, must be fair and equitable.  USGC Inc. , 
B-400184.2 et al. , Dec.  24, 2008, 2009 CPD ¶ 9 at 3.  When an agency engages in 
discussions with an offeror, the discussions must be “meaningful,” that is, sufficiently detailed so as to lead an offeror into the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or 
revision.  See  FAR 15.306(d)(3); Southeastern Kidney Council , B-412538, Mar. 17, 
2016, 2016 CPD ¶  90 at 4.  Agencies, however, are not required to “spoon- feed” an 
offeror during discussions by identifying every possible area where a proposal might be improved or suggesting alternative approaches.  Vizada Inc. , B-405251 et al. , Oct. 5, 
2011, 2011 CPD ¶  235 at  11. 
 
Here, the record shows that, following discussions, ManTech revised its quotation by inserting the words “development, test, integration, and operations support,” deleting one task that used the word “O&M,” and adding several tasks descriptions.  AR, Tab 5-1, ManTech Phase One Quotation at  12; see also Comments and Supp. Protest 
at 9 (showing track changes).  After evaluating ManTech’s revised quotation, the 
agency found that its concerns were not resolved and identified this as a decreased confidence area.   AR, Tab  6-1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at  5.  As 
the contracting officer explains, the information added to ManTech’s quotation was still “clearly O&M activit[y]” and failed to meet the solicitation’s requirements to address the various  elements of SAFe framework.  COS at 11.  
 Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency’s evaluation of ManTech’s quotation under the corporate experience factor or the adequacy of the discussions.  In revising its quotation, ManTech inserted various words and deleted the task that specifically referenced O&M --but, in evaluating the revised quotation, the 
agency considered the entirety of the quotation and found that it still did not address development, test, integration and O&M.  In our view, the agency reasonably concluded that ManTech’s revised quotation still failed to meaningfully address the solicitation requirements and the agency’s concerns raised during discussions.  Moreover, the plain language of the agency’s evaluation notice identified the aspects of ManTec h’s 
quotation that needed to be addressed to include the agency’s express concern that  Page 10 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  ManTech’s experience reflected O&M work rather than the broader requirement s of the 
task order.  ManTech’s various expressions of disagreement, without more, are 
insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  
 
Staffing Approach Factor  
 For the staffing approach factor, the agency assigned ManTech’s quotation a rating of “some confidence,” and found six areas that decreased the agency’s confidence in ManTech’s successful task order performance.  ManTech’s protest expresses its disagreement with each of the assessments.   
 For example, the agency criticized ManTech’s focus on hiring of incumbent staff at the beginning of the transition period, and its failure to begin recruiting external hires until after the first [redacted]  days, describing this as a “reactive approach to staffing and 
transition that introduces significant risk.”
16  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 11; see AR 
Tab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing Approach) at 3- 4.  ManTech acknowledges 
that its quotation stated that, following the first [redacted] days of the transition period, 
ManTech would “[c]onduct internal and external hiring and outreach events (if needed),” see AR, Tab 5- 1, ManTech Quotation at 22, but nonetheless, asserts that the agency’s 
concern was “unreasonable.”  Protest at 31.  
 The agency defends its assessment on the basis that ManTech’s quotation indicated it would delay recruitment activities for external hires until after the first portion of the transition period had passed, concluding that ManTech’s focus on incumbent capture 
rather than “simultaneously” conducting external recruitment activities created risk that 
could “disrupt work.”  COS at 13- 14; see AR, Tab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing 
Approach) at 3- 4.  More specifically, the agency notes that ManTech’s delayed 
approach to recruiting external hires could “create a security backlog and place a significant strain on the onboarding process.”  COS at 13- 14. 
 As noted above, our Office will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency’s 
evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , supra.   
 
Here, ManTech acknowledges the agency’s “correct” reading of its quotation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  10-11.  While ManTech contends that the agency 
“ignored” other “pre- transition recruitment activities” in its quotation, id. , the protester 
does not explain how this addressed the RFQ’s transition requirements or mitigated the 
 
16 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to discuss their proposed “methodologies 
and capabilities to recruit and retain employees”; stated that “[i]f the Quoter’s transition approach is ‘incumbent capture’, the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if incumbent capture is not successful”; and provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor’s approach.  RFQ at 54- 55, 64.   Page 11 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  agency’s concerns about recruiting delays during transition.  For example, ManTech’s 
quotation indicated it had [redacted] , but these activities were limited to the time period 
leading up to a possible task order award and not during transition.  See  AR, Tab  5-1, 
ManTech Phase One Quotation at  21.  These aspects of the quotation do not address 
ManTech’s decision to wait until [redacted]  days into the transition period to address 
staffing if incumbent capture was not successful.  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency’s concerns regarding the potential risks associated with ManTech’s staffing approach.  This protest ground is denied.  
 Best-Value Tradeoff Decision  
 
Finally, ManTech challenges the agency’s best -value tradeoff decision “based upon an 
improper evaluation.”  Protest at 37.  To the extent this complaint is based on 
ManTech’s various allegations that we have rejected, the protest fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See , e.g., CORE O’Ahu, LLC, B -421714, B -421714.2, Aug. 31, 2022, 
2023 CPD ¶ 212 at 11.  In any event, the record shows that the agency considered the detailed evaluation documentation, compared the competing quotations, and concluded:  “Even though ManTech’s solution is lower priced, the Government determined the lower 
price is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach and ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.”  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award 
at 15.  O n the record here, ManTech has not established that the agency’s best -value 
tradeoff decision was flawed.  
 
The protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.

B-422063.2,"June 18, 2025","Automated Precision, Inc","1.  Protest that agency improperly rejected protester’s proposal is denied where the protester failed to provide a certification required by solicitation provision implementing 
relevant Buy American requirements . 
 2.  Protester is not an interested party to challenge other aspects of agency’s evaluation where the protester was not eligible for award as a result of submitting a technically unacceptable proposal.  
DECISION  
 Automated Precision, Inc. (API), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, protests the award of a contract to Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Inc., of Kingstown, Rhode Island, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N68335- 22-R-0163, issued by the 
Depart ment of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, for laser trackers and 
associated component parts for the V -22 aircraft.  The protester contends that the 
agency improperly rejected API’s proposal for failing to meet solicitation requirements.  
 We deny the protest in part and d ismiss  it in part.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The procurement history for this requirement spans several years.  The Navy first issued the solicitation on April 22, 2022, seeking commercially available off -the-shelf 
laser trackers capable of performing highly accurate three- dimensional measurements  Page 2 B-422063.2  for the V -22 aircraft.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and  Memorandum of Law 
(COS/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation was issued on 
an unrestricted basis and contemplated the award of a fixed- price contract.  RFP at 1, 3.  
Award was to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest -priced, technically 
acceptable proposal.  Id.  at 3-4.   
 
The solicitation identified numerous minimum technical requirements the proposed laser 
tracker product was required to meet to be considered acceptable.  Id . at 5.  A s relevant 
here, the proposed laser tracker was required to meet a humidity requirement of “0 to 95 [percent] non- condensing.”  Id.   The solicitation indicated that “[a]ll proposals will be 
evaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements set forth in the 
solicitation [,]” and “[a] technical proposal must be found to be acceptable in all areas to 
be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.”  Id . at 4 .  The RFP further 
advised that a proposal  with an unacceptable rating under the technical factor  will result 
in the entire proposal being found unacceptable and eliminated from the competition.  Id.   
 In addition, the solicitation incorporated by reference Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.225- 7001, “Buy American and Balance of 
Payments Program.”  RFP at 46.  The clause implements  the Buy American statute,  
41 U.S.C. §§ 8301- 8305 (formerly the Buy American Act, 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a- 10d) and 
the Department of Defense Balance of Payments Program, by establishing a preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except for foreign end products of 
certai n qualify ing countries.  The solicitation also incorporated DFARS provision 
252.225- 7000, Buy American--Balance of Payments Program Certificate (Buy American 
certificate), which requires offerors to certify whether their proposed products are domestic end products from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.
2  RFP at 46; DFARS 
provision 252.225- 7000(c).  
 The agency received three timely proposals, including proposals  from API and 
Hexagon.  COS/MOL at 3.  On September 27, 2023, the agency awarded the contract to Hexagon as the lowest -priced, technically acceptable offer.  Id.  API then filed a 
protest with our Office on October 4.  A fter the agency notified our Office that the Navy 
intended to take corrective action by  re-evaluat ing proposals, we dismissed API’s

2 Agencies may have accompanying evaluation obligations depending upon the certified 
origin of proposed end products.  For example, if an end product is certified  as a foreign 
end product, the agency must evaluate the proposal in accordance with part 225 of the DFARS, which instructs the agency to apply an evaluation factor of 50 percent to a proposal if the low -priced proposal is a foreign end product that is not otherwise exempt 
from the price evaluation factors under the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program.  DFARS provision 252.225- 7000(b)(1); see DFARS 225.502(c)(ii)(E).   Page 3 B-422063.2  protest as academic.  Automated Precision, Inc. , B-422063 (unpublished decision); 
COS/MOL at 3-4. 
 
On February 12, 2024,  as part of  the corrective action re evaluation , the agency  
determined that it had mistakenly identified API’s proposal as technically acceptable.  
COS/MOL at 4.  Consequently, the Navy opened discussions with all remaining offerors and requested additional information from API to confirm whether API’s proposed laser tracker product conform ed to solicitation requirements.   AR, Tab 9, Feb. 23, Discussion 
Letter at 1.  Specifically, the agency explained that the product brochure API included with its proposal listed the relative humidity as 10- 95 percent, conflicting with the 
solicitation’s minimum requirement of 0- 95 percent.  Id.  The discussion letter also noted 
API’s missing Buy American certificate and requested that API complete and submit the Buy American certificate,  individually addressing each contract line item number  (CLIN)  
identified in the solicitation.  Id .; COS/MOL at 4 . 
 In response, API submitted a letter to the Navy and attached an updated product brochure for the proposed Radian Plus model, explaining that API had included an 
outdated brochure with its initial proposal and noting the model’s current specifications reflect ed the solicitation’s required humidity figure of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 11, API 
Revised Proposal, March 14 at 1, 4.  API also submitted the required Buy American certificate where API certified the country of origin for its proposed end products.  Id.  
at 7-9. 
 On July 24, the agency amended the solicitation to include the most recent versions of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 and DFARS clause 252.225- 7001 and to identify all 
CLINs  the agency considered “end products” for purposes of Buy American compliance 
and certification.  AR, Tab 13, RFP Amendment 0004; COS/MOL at 5.  As a result, the 
Navy opened a second round of discussions and requested that API update its  Buy 
American certificat e to conform with the amended solicitation.  AR, Tab 14, July 24, 
Discussion Letter at 1.  After API submitted its updated Buy American certificate, the Navy initiated a third round of discussions and requested that API correct errors the 
agency identified in API’s Buy American certificate.  AR, Tab 18, August 26, Discussion Letter at 1.  On August 29, API submitted a corrected Buy American certificate to the 
Navy .  AR, Tab  20, API August 29, Buy American Certificate; COS/MOL at 5.  
 On November 14, the agency notified offerors that discussions were closed and requested final proposal revisions, indicating that the Navy “intend[ed] to make award 
without any further discussions or obtaining further proposal revisions.”  AR, Tab 22, Request for Final Proposal Revision at 1.  The agency also advised offerors that “[m]ajor revisions to your proposal are not anticipat ed; however, should you revise your 
proposal in any way, rationale for each revision must be provided in sufficient detail,  Page 4 B-422063.2  including substantiation, as a response to this [final proposal revision] letter.”3  Id.; 
COS/MOL at 5 -6.  
 
API submitted a timely final proposal revision , which substituted a new tracker model, 
the Integrated Laser Tracker (iLTx), in place of the Radian Plus model that API had 
proposed previously.  AR, Tab 24, Final Proposal Revision at 2.  API included updated 
pricing and an updated brochure detailing the iLTx product speci fications.  AR, Tab 24, 
Final Proposal Revision at 4 .  API did not, however, include an updated Buy American 
certificate  for the new tracker model .  COS/MOL at 6.  
 
On March 21, 2025, the Navy concluded its evaluation, determining that the new 
product submitted by API, the iLTx laser tracker, was technically unacceptable because 
the specifications in the product brochure API submitted indicated 10- 95 percent 
humidity,  conflicting with the solicitation’s minimum 0- 95 percent humidity requirement.  
AR, Tab 26, Source Selection Decision (SSD)  at 2.  The agency also rejected API’s 
proposal as noncompliant because API failed to submit a Buy American certificate for 
the new laser tracker .  Id. at 3.  The Navy then identified Hexagon as the responsible 
and technically acceptable offeror with the lowest price and recommended lifting the 
stop- work order on the contract previously awarded to Hexagon.  Id . at 4; COS/MOL 
at 7-8.   
 
After the agency notified API  of the new selection decision and provided API with a 
debriefing, API filed this protest with our Office.  
 DISCUSSION 
 The protester contends the agency unreasonably evaluated API’s lower -priced proposal 
as technically unacceptable.  Protest at 1- 7.  Specifically, API argues that the agency 
erred by rejecting API’s proposal for failing to submit the Buy American certification required by the solicitation and for not allowing API to remedy this “correctable oversight” though clarifications.  Id . at 5 -6.  The protester also argues the agency should 
have allowed API to clarify and update the product specification information, as API was 
allowed to do following the submission of its initial proposal .  Id. at 3.  The protester 
further  suggests that the Navy may have disparately evaluated proposals by relaxing 
the solicitation’s minimum relative humidity requirement for the awardee but not for API.
4  Id. at 2-5.  We have reviewed all of the protester’s arguments, and although we 
 
3 The agency also notified API that if did not have any additional updates to its proposal, 
API “need not provide anything more than a letter stating that the proposal and responses provided during discussions constitute the [final proposal revision ].”
  
COS/MOL at 5.  
4 API elected to proceed with its protest without counsel, and our Office did not issue a 
protective order for this protest.  As such, our discussion of some aspects of the agency’s evaluation is, necessarily, general in nature to avoid reference to non- public 
information.   Page 5 B-422063.2  do not address every argument in this decision, we find no basis to sustain API’s 
protest.5  
 
Buy American Certificate  
 The protester argues that the agency unreasonably rejected API’s final proposal revision for failing to certify whether API’s  proposed products were domestic end 
products from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.  Protest at 5- 7.  API argues  that the 
Navy “neither requested [Buy American] compliance documentation with API’s [final revised proposal] nor provided API with a form or opportunity to certify compliance[.]”  Id. at 5.  Relatedly, API contends that the solicitation failed to include the provision at 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.225- 2, Buy American Certificate, which 
“depriv[ed] API of a fair chance to demonstrate compliance.”  Id. at 6.  API also asserts 
that because its proposed iLTx laser tracker is “unequivocally [a] domestic end product,” the agency should have allowed API to submit a revised proposal or sought “clarifications for minor or clerical errors” if the agency requir ed documentation 
confirmin g the iLTx laser tracker’s Buy American compliance.  Id.    
 As discussed below, these arguments are without merit.  
 As an initial matter,  as the agency  correctly  notes, solicitations issued by Department of 
Defense agencies, such as the Navy here, must include DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, instead of FAR provision 52.225- 2.  COS/MOL at 18; DFARS 
225.1101(2)(i).  As discussed above, DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 was incorporated 
by reference into the solicitation; as a result, all offerors were notified of the requirement to certify thei r proposed products as domestic end products, qualifying country end 
products, or other  foreign end products.  See DFARS provision 252. 225-7000(c).  We 
see no error associated with the agency incorporati ng into the solicitation DFARS 
provision 252.225- 7000, and not FAR provision 52.225- 2.

5 For example, several of API’s allegations questioned the basis for the inclusion of 
certain solicitation requirements, such as the solicitation’s 0- 95 percent minimum 
humidity requirement.  See Protest at 2- 7.  To the extent these arguments  challenge  the 
terms of the solicitation, such as the agency’s decision to include the requirement at section 1.01(m) of the RFP concerning 0- 95 percent relative humidity or the agency’s 
decision to incorporate DFARS provision 252.225- 7000,  we find them to be untimely  
solicitation challenges that should have been raised prior to the closing time for receipt 
of proposals.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , B-420955.2, Oct. 31, 2022, 2022

6 At any rate , as noted above, API failed to challenge the terms of the solicitation, such 
as the incorporation of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, prior to the closing time  for 
receipt of proposals ; as a result, any such challenge is now untimely.  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , supra at 4.    Page 6 B-422063.2  Second, we find no merit to  the argument that the agency was required to further notify 
API of its obligation to submit a current and correct Buy American certificate  with its final 
proposal revision.  Protest at 5- 7.  API initially proposed the Radian Plus laser tracker 
model.  Id . at 1 -3; COS/MOL at 4.  After multiple  rounds of discussion where the agency 
either specifically requested API’s missing Buy American certificate or identified 
deficiencies contained therein, API elected to propose a new laser tr acker product --the 
iLTx laser tracker --in its final proposal revision.7  Protest at 1 -2; AR, Tab 24, API Final 
Revised Proposal at 2, 4.  Under the terms of the solicitation and DFARS provision 252.225- 7000(c) , API was required to certify the country of origin for all proposed end 
products, including the iLTx laser tracker, or risk having its proposal rejected as non-compliant.
8  We find unavailing any suggestion that the protester was not given 
sufficient notice of the need to submit Buy American certification of all end products identified in API’s final proposal revision --particularly considering the agency’s repeated 
discussion s with the protester concerning API’s  missing or deficient Buy American 
certificate s. 
 Further , we reject the protester’s argument that because of the iLTx laser tracker’s 
“indisputable domestic production,” API should have been allowed to clarify the omission of API’s Buy American certificate as a “minor or clerical error[]” without opening discussions.   Protest at 6.
  As a general rule,  clarifications  are limited 
exchanges between an agency and an offeror for the purpose of  eliminating minor  
uncertainties or  irregularities  in a proposal, and do not give an offeror the opportunity to 
revise or modify its  proposal.  FAR 15.306(a)(2) ; Satellite Servs., Inc., B -295866, 
B-295866.2, Apr. 20, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 84 at 2- 3 n.2.  Agencies have broad discretion 
as to whether to seek clarifications from offerors, but offerors have no automatic right to 
clarifications regarding proposals --and such communications cannot be used to cure 
proposal deficiencies or material omissions , materially alter the technical or cost 
elements of the proposal, or otherwise revise the proposal.  Alltech Engineering Corp ., 
B-414002.2, Feb. 6, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 49 at 6.   
 
Although API views its proposal’s omission of the Buy American certificate to be minor or clerical, correction of this omission would have required the agency to conduct discussions to allow API to submit the certification required by DFARS provision 
252.225- 7000(c) --a material solicitation requirement the agency addressed with API on 
 
7 In the context of an RFP, it is well established that the submission of a final proposal 
revision demonstrates an offeror’s intent to modify or replace its initial offer, thus extinguishing an agency’s ability to accept the earlier offer.   See, e.g., UNICA- BPA JV, 
LLC, B-422580.3, Jan. 8, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶ 2 at 4 .   
8 As noted above, in solicitation amendment 0004 and in the second round of 
discussions with API the agency specifically identified the laser tracker CLIN as an “end product ,” as defined in DFARS clause 252.225- 7001, requiring certification in 
accordance with DFARS provision 252.225- 7000.  See AR, Tab 13, Amendment 0004 
at 2; see also COS/MOL at 5.    Page 7 B-422063.2  three prior occasions.9  Cf. Highmark Medicare Servs., Inc., et al ., B-401062.5 et al., 
Oct. 29, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 285 at 11 (discussions occur when an agency 
communicates with an offeror for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determine the acceptability of a proposal, or provide the offeror with an opportunity to revise or modi fy its proposal in some material respect).  Nor are we persuaded by API’s 
argument for the “indisputable domestic production” of the iLTx laser tracker as a basis for allowing clarification since the Buy American certificate is the manner in which offerors  certify the country of origin for all proposed end products --and API failed to 
submit the required certification notifying the agency of that fact . 
 Finally, to the extent that API argues generally that the agency’s  rejection of its final 
proposal revision was unreasonable, we disagree.  The solicitation indicated that “[a]ll proposals will be evaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements 
set forth in the solicitation” and that “[a] technical proposal must be found to be 
acceptable in all areas to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.”  RFP at 4.  Under these circumstances, the agency reasonably rejected API’s proposal for failing to include the required Buy American certification.  It is an offeror ’s 
responsibility to submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that 
clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements.  FitNet Purchasing Alliance , B-410797, Feb. 12, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 78 at 4 (finding reasonable t he 
agency’s rejection of a  vendor’s quot ation for failing to include a  required Buy American 
certification).  We see no basis to fault the agency for enforcing the very terms of the solicitation requirement , discussed repeatedly with API , after API submitted a proposal 
that again omitted the required Buy American certification.  
 
Interested Party Dismissal  
 
The protester also alleges the agency erred by assessing API’s proposal as technically unacceptable for failing to meet the solicitation’s minimum relative humidity requirement and by not allowing API to submit a revised proposal, as was previously  permitted .  See 
Protest at 1- 3.  API further submits that the agency may have engaged in disparate 
 
9 We note that the agency  was not  obliged to re open discussions  to allow API to submit 
the correct Buy American certification.  Discussions, when conducted, must identify proposal deficiencies and significant weaknesses that could be addressed to materially enhance the offeror’s potential for receiving award.  Serco Inc. , B-405280, Oct. 12, 
2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 237 at 11.  However, agencies are not required to reopen 
discussions to afford offeror s an additional opportunity to revise its proposal where a 
weakness or deficiency is first introduced in the firm’s revised proposal.   See, e.g., 
MetalCraft Marine, Inc., B -410199, B -410199.2, Nov. 13, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 338 at 10.  
Moreover, the Navy here notified API that the agency “i ntend[ed] to make award without 
any further discussions or obtaining further proposal revisions.”  AR, Tab 22, Req.  for 
Final Proposal Revision at 1.   Since API failed to submit the required Buy American 
certificate with its final proposal revision, the agency had no obligation to reopen discussions with API and allow another opportunity for a final proposal revision.

Hexagon but not API.  Id . at 3 -4.  We do not need to resolve these issues, however, 
because we find that API is not an interested party to pursue its remaining challenges 
since API’s proposal fails to conform to a material solicitation requirement, rendering the  
proposal technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.10 
 Under the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, only an interested party may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. §§ 3551- 3557.  That is, 
a protester must be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest 
would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract.  4 C.F.R.           
§ 21.0(a)(1).  In the post -award context, we have generally found that a protester is an 
interested party to challenge an agency’s evaluation of proposals only where there is a 
reasonable possibility that the protester would be next in line for award if its protest were sustained.  CACI, Inc. -Fed., B-419499, Mar. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 125 at 5.  A 
protester is therefore not an interested party if it would not be eligible to receive a 
contract award were its protest allegations sustained.  Win Aviation, Inc. , B-422037,

solicitation is considered unacceptable and may not form the basis for award.  PAE

Here, even if API were to prevail on its challenges to the agency’s  evaluation of the 
solicitation’s minimum relative humidity requirement, the protester would not be next in line for award.  In this regard,  as noted above,  we find the agency reasonably rejected 
API’s proposal for omitting the required Buy American certificate from its final proposal revision.  See FitNet Purchasing Alliance, supra at 4.  We note further that the Navy 
received a second technically acceptable proposal  in response to the RFP.   AR, Tab 26, 
SSD at 2-3.  Where there are intervening offerors who would be in line for award even if 
 
10 Even if we were to consider these allegations, however, we see no reason to question 
the agency’s evaluation of API’s proposal as technically unacceptable and no evidence 
of disparate treatment.  As noted above, the agency initially determined that API’s proposed Radian Plus model did not meet the solicitation’s humidity level  requirement  
of 0-95 percent .  COS/MOL at 4 -6.  After the Navy identified the express conflict 
between the product specifications included in API’s initial proposal and the solicitation’s 
humidity requirement, API submitted an updated brochure showing a humidity level of 0-95 percent for the Radian Plus model.  AR, Tab 11, API Revised Proposal, March 14 
at 4.  When API submitted its final proposal revision, however, API included a product 
brochure for a new product (the iLTx laser tracker) showing a relative humidity level at 10-95 percent, which the agency again noted conflicted with the solicitation’s mini mum 
relative humidity requirement of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 26, SSD at 2; COS/MOL at 6.  
In contrast, the product specifications included in Hexagon’s proposal were consistent with other aspects of Hexagon’s technical proposal affirming compliance with the 
solicitation’s humidity percentage requirements, see AR, Tab 3, Hexagon Proposal at 6, 
166, and, unlike API’s proposal, Hexagon’s proposal did not include product 
specifications in direct conflict with the solicitation’s humidity  percentage requirement.    Page 9 B-422063.2  the protester’s challenges were sustained, we generally consider the protester’s interest 
to be too remote to qualify as an interested party.  See, e.g., HCR Constr., Inc.; Southern Aire Contracting, Inc. , B-418070.4, B -418070.5, May 8, 2020, 2020 CPD  
¶ 166 at 6- 7 n.6.  Accordingly, we conclude that API is not an interested party for 
purposes of challenging the agency’s evaluation of the technical proposals submitted by API and Hexagon.    The protest is d enied in part and dismissed  in part.

DIGEST  
 1.  Protest that agency improperly rejected protester’s proposal is denied where the protester failed to provide a certification required by solicitation provision implementing 
relevant Buy American requirements . 
 2.  Protester is not an interested party to challenge other aspects of agency’s evaluation where the protester was not eligible for award as a result of submitting a technically unacceptable proposal.  
DECISION  
 Automated Precision, Inc. (API), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, protests the award of a contract to Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Inc., of Kingstown, Rhode Island, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N68335- 22-R-0163, issued by the 
Depart ment of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, for laser trackers and 
associated component parts for the V -22 aircraft.  The protester contends that the 
agency improperly rejected API’s proposal for failing to meet solicitation requirements.  
 We deny the protest in part and d ismiss  it in part.  
 BACKGROUND  
 The procurement history for this requirement spans several years.  The Navy first issued the solicitation on April 22, 2022, seeking commercially available off -the-shelf 
laser trackers capable of performing highly accurate three- dimensional measurements  Page 2 B-422063.2  for the V -22 aircraft.  Contracting Officer’s Statement and  Memorandum of Law 
(COS/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation was issued on 
an unrestricted basis and contemplated the award of a fixed- price contract.  RFP at 1, 3.  
Award was to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest -priced, technically 
acceptable proposal.  Id.  at 3-4.   
 
The solicitation identified numerous minimum technical requirements the proposed laser 
tracker product was required to meet to be considered acceptable.  Id . at 5.  A s relevant 
here, the proposed laser tracker was required to meet a humidity requirement of “0 to 95 [percent] non- condensing.”  Id.   The solicitation indicated that “[a]ll proposals will be 
evaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements set forth in the 
solicitation [,]” and “[a] technical proposal must be found to be acceptable in all areas to 
be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.”  Id . at 4 .  The RFP further 
advised that a proposal  with an unacceptable rating under the technical factor  will result 
in the entire proposal being found unacceptable and eliminated from the competition.  Id.   
 In addition, the solicitation incorporated by reference Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.225- 7001, “Buy American and Balance of 
Payments Program.”  RFP at 46.  The clause implements  the Buy American statute,  
41 U.S.C. §§ 8301- 8305 (formerly the Buy American Act, 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a- 10d) and 
the Department of Defense Balance of Payments Program, by establishing a preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except for foreign end products of 
certai n qualify ing countries.  The solicitation also incorporated DFARS provision 
252.225- 7000, Buy American--Balance of Payments Program Certificate (Buy American 
certificate), which requires offerors to certify whether their proposed products are domestic end products from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.
2  RFP at 46; DFARS 
provision 252.225- 7000(c).  
 The agency received three timely proposals, including proposals  from API and 
Hexagon.  COS/MOL at 3.  On September 27, 2023, the agency awarded the contract to Hexagon as the lowest -priced, technically acceptable offer.  Id.  API then filed a 
protest with our Office on October 4.  A fter the agency notified our Office that the Navy 
intended to take corrective action by  re-evaluat ing proposals, we dismissed API’s

2 Agencies may have accompanying evaluation obligations depending upon the certified 
origin of proposed end products.  For example, if an end product is certified  as a foreign 
end product, the agency must evaluate the proposal in accordance with part 225 of the DFARS, which instructs the agency to apply an evaluation factor of 50 percent to a proposal if the low -priced proposal is a foreign end product that is not otherwise exempt 
from the price evaluation factors under the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program.  DFARS provision 252.225- 7000(b)(1); see DFARS 225.502(c)(ii)(E).   Page 3 B-422063.2  protest as academic.  Automated Precision, Inc. , B-422063 (unpublished decision); 
COS/MOL at 3-4. 
 
On February 12, 2024,  as part of  the corrective action re evaluation , the agency  
determined that it had mistakenly identified API’s proposal as technically acceptable.  
COS/MOL at 4.  Consequently, the Navy opened discussions with all remaining offerors and requested additional information from API to confirm whether API’s proposed laser tracker product conform ed to solicitation requirements.   AR, Tab 9, Feb. 23, Discussion 
Letter at 1.  Specifically, the agency explained that the product brochure API included with its proposal listed the relative humidity as 10- 95 percent, conflicting with the 
solicitation’s minimum requirement of 0- 95 percent.  Id.  The discussion letter also noted 
API’s missing Buy American certificate and requested that API complete and submit the Buy American certificate,  individually addressing each contract line item number  (CLIN)  
identified in the solicitation.  Id .; COS/MOL at 4 . 
 In response, API submitted a letter to the Navy and attached an updated product brochure for the proposed Radian Plus model, explaining that API had included an 
outdated brochure with its initial proposal and noting the model’s current specifications reflect ed the solicitation’s required humidity figure of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 11, API 
Revised Proposal, March 14 at 1, 4.  API also submitted the required Buy American certificate where API certified the country of origin for its proposed end products.  Id.  
at 7-9. 
 On July 24, the agency amended the solicitation to include the most recent versions of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 and DFARS clause 252.225- 7001 and to identify all 
CLINs  the agency considered “end products” for purposes of Buy American compliance 
and certification.  AR, Tab 13, RFP Amendment 0004; COS/MOL at 5.  As a result, the 
Navy opened a second round of discussions and requested that API update its  Buy 
American certificat e to conform with the amended solicitation.  AR, Tab 14, July 24, 
Discussion Letter at 1.  After API submitted its updated Buy American certificate, the Navy initiated a third round of discussions and requested that API correct errors the 
agency identified in API’s Buy American certificate.  AR, Tab 18, August 26, Discussion Letter at 1.  On August 29, API submitted a corrected Buy American certificate to the 
Navy .  AR, Tab  20, API August 29, Buy American Certificate; COS/MOL at 5.  
 On November 14, the agency notified offerors that discussions were closed and requested final proposal revisions, indicating that the Navy “intend[ed] to make award 
without any further discussions or obtaining further proposal revisions.”  AR, Tab 22, Request for Final Proposal Revision at 1.  The agency also advised offerors that “[m]ajor revisions to your proposal are not anticipat ed; however, should you revise your 
proposal in any way, rationale for each revision must be provided in sufficient detail,  Page 4 B-422063.2  including substantiation, as a response to this [final proposal revision] letter.”3  Id.; 
COS/MOL at 5 -6.  
 
API submitted a timely final proposal revision , which substituted a new tracker model, 
the Integrated Laser Tracker (iLTx), in place of the Radian Plus model that API had 
proposed previously.  AR, Tab 24, Final Proposal Revision at 2.  API included updated 
pricing and an updated brochure detailing the iLTx product speci fications.  AR, Tab 24, 
Final Proposal Revision at 4 .  API did not, however, include an updated Buy American 
certificate  for the new tracker model .  COS/MOL at 6.  
 
On March 21, 2025, the Navy concluded its evaluation, determining that the new 
product submitted by API, the iLTx laser tracker, was technically unacceptable because 
the specifications in the product brochure API submitted indicated 10- 95 percent 
humidity,  conflicting with the solicitation’s minimum 0- 95 percent humidity requirement.  
AR, Tab 26, Source Selection Decision (SSD)  at 2.  The agency also rejected API’s 
proposal as noncompliant because API failed to submit a Buy American certificate for 
the new laser tracker .  Id. at 3.  The Navy then identified Hexagon as the responsible 
and technically acceptable offeror with the lowest price and recommended lifting the 
stop- work order on the contract previously awarded to Hexagon.  Id . at 4; COS/MOL 
at 7-8.   
 
After the agency notified API  of the new selection decision and provided API with a 
debriefing, API filed this protest with our Office.  
 DISCUSSION 
 The protester contends the agency unreasonably evaluated API’s lower -priced proposal 
as technically unacceptable.  Protest at 1- 7.  Specifically, API argues that the agency 
erred by rejecting API’s proposal for failing to submit the Buy American certification required by the solicitation and for not allowing API to remedy this “correctable oversight” though clarifications.  Id . at 5 -6.  The protester also argues the agency should 
have allowed API to clarify and update the product specification information, as API was 
allowed to do following the submission of its initial proposal .  Id. at 3.  The protester 
further  suggests that the Navy may have disparately evaluated proposals by relaxing 
the solicitation’s minimum relative humidity requirement for the awardee but not for API.
4  Id. at 2-5.  We have reviewed all of the protester’s arguments, and although we 
 
3 The agency also notified API that if did not have any additional updates to its proposal, 
API “need not provide anything more than a letter stating that the proposal and responses provided during discussions constitute the [final proposal revision ].”
  
COS/MOL at 5.  
4 API elected to proceed with its protest without counsel, and our Office did not issue a 
protective order for this protest.  As such, our discussion of some aspects of the agency’s evaluation is, necessarily, general in nature to avoid reference to non- public 
information.   Page 5 B-422063.2  do not address every argument in this decision, we find no basis to sustain API’s 
protest.5  
 
Buy American Certificate  
 The protester argues that the agency unreasonably rejected API’s final proposal revision for failing to certify whether API’s  proposed products were domestic end 
products from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.  Protest at 5- 7.  API argues  that the 
Navy “neither requested [Buy American] compliance documentation with API’s [final revised proposal] nor provided API with a form or opportunity to certify compliance[.]”  Id. at 5.  Relatedly, API contends that the solicitation failed to include the provision at 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.225- 2, Buy American Certificate, which 
“depriv[ed] API of a fair chance to demonstrate compliance.”  Id. at 6.  API also asserts 
that because its proposed iLTx laser tracker is “unequivocally [a] domestic end product,” the agency should have allowed API to submit a revised proposal or sought “clarifications for minor or clerical errors” if the agency requir ed documentation 
confirmin g the iLTx laser tracker’s Buy American compliance.  Id.    
 As discussed below, these arguments are without merit.  
 As an initial matter,  as the agency  correctly  notes, solicitations issued by Department of 
Defense agencies, such as the Navy here, must include DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, instead of FAR provision 52.225- 2.  COS/MOL at 18; DFARS 
225.1101(2)(i).  As discussed above, DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 was incorporated 
by reference into the solicitation; as a result, all offerors were notified of the requirement to certify thei r proposed products as domestic end products, qualifying country end 
products, or other  foreign end products.  See DFARS provision 252. 225-7000(c).  We 
see no error associated with the agency incorporati ng into the solicitation DFARS 
provision 252.225- 7000, and not FAR provision 52.225- 2.

5 For example, several of API’s allegations questioned the basis for the inclusion of 
certain solicitation requirements, such as the solicitation’s 0- 95 percent minimum 
humidity requirement.  See Protest at 2- 7.  To the extent these arguments  challenge  the 
terms of the solicitation, such as the agency’s decision to include the requirement at section 1.01(m) of the RFP concerning 0- 95 percent relative humidity or the agency’s 
decision to incorporate DFARS provision 252.225- 7000,  we find them to be untimely  
solicitation challenges that should have been raised prior to the closing time for receipt 
of proposals.  4 C.F.R. §  21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , B-420955.2, Oct. 31, 2022, 2022 
CPD ¶ 276 at 4 .   
6 At any rate , as noted above, API failed to challenge the terms of the solicitation, such 
as the incorporation of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, prior to the closing time  for 
receipt of proposals ; as a result, any such challenge is now untimely.  4 C.F.R. 
§ 21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , supra at 4.    Page 6 B-422063.2  Second, we find no merit to  the argument that the agency was required to further notify 
API of its obligation to submit a current and correct Buy American certificate  with its final 
proposal revision.  Protest at 5- 7.  API initially proposed the Radian Plus laser tracker 
model.  Id . at 1 -3; COS/MOL at 4.  After multiple  rounds of discussion where the agency 
either specifically requested API’s missing Buy American certificate or identified 
deficiencies contained therein, API elected to propose a new laser tr acker product --the 
iLTx laser tracker --in its final proposal revision.7  Protest at 1 -2; AR, Tab 24, API Final 
Revised Proposal at 2, 4.  Under the terms of the solicitation and DFARS provision 252.225- 7000(c) , API was required to certify the country of origin for all proposed end 
products, including the iLTx laser tracker, or risk having its proposal rejected as non-compliant.
8  We find unavailing any suggestion that the protester was not given 
sufficient notice of the need to submit Buy American certification of all end products identified in API’s final proposal revision --particularly considering the agency’s repeated 
discussion s with the protester concerning API’s  missing or deficient Buy American 
certificate s. 
 Further , we reject the protester’s argument that because of the iLTx laser tracker’s 
“indisputable domestic production,” API should have been allowed to clarify the omission of API’s Buy American certificate as a “minor or clerical error[]” without opening discussions.   Protest at 6.
  As a general rule,  clarifications  are limited 
exchanges between an agency and an offeror for the purpose of  eliminating minor  
uncertainties or  irregularities  in a proposal, and do not give an offeror the opportunity to 
revise or modify its  proposal.  FAR 15.306(a)(2) ; Satellite Servs., Inc., B -295866, 
B-295866.2, Apr. 20, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 84 at 2- 3 n.2.  Agencies have broad discretion 
as to whether to seek clarifications from offerors, but offerors have no automatic right to 
clarifications regarding proposals --and such communications cannot be used to cure 
proposal deficiencies or material omissions , materially alter the technical or cost 
elements of the proposal, or otherwise revise the proposal.  Alltech Engineering Corp ., 
B-414002.2, Feb. 6, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ 49 at 6.   
 
Although API views its proposal’s omission of the Buy American certificate to be minor or clerical, correction of this omission would have required the agency to conduct discussions to allow API to submit the certification required by DFARS provision 
252.225- 7000(c) --a material solicitation requirement the agency addressed with API on 
 
7 In the context of an RFP, it is well established that the submission of a final proposal 
revision demonstrates an offeror’s intent to modify or replace its initial offer, thus extinguishing an agency’s ability to accept the earlier offer.   See, e.g., UNICA- BPA JV, 
LLC, B-422580.3, Jan. 8, 2025, 2025 CPD ¶ 2 at 4 .   
8 As noted above, in solicitation amendment 0004 and in the second round of 
discussions with API the agency specifically identified the laser tracker CLIN as an “end product ,” as defined in DFARS clause 252.225- 7001, requiring certification in 
accordance with DFARS provision 252.225- 7000.  See AR, Tab 13, Amendment 0004 
at 2; see also COS/MOL at 5.    Page 7 B-422063.2  three prior occasions.9  Cf. Highmark Medicare Servs., Inc., et al ., B-401062.5 et al., 
Oct. 29, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 285 at 11 (discussions occur when an agency 
communicates with an offeror for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determine the acceptability of a proposal, or provide the offeror with an opportunity to revise or modi fy its proposal in some material respect).  Nor are we persuaded by API’s 
argument for the “indisputable domestic production” of the iLTx laser tracker as a basis for allowing clarification since the Buy American certificate is the manner in which offerors  certify the country of origin for all proposed end products --and API failed to 
submit the required certification notifying the agency of that fact . 
 Finally, to the extent that API argues generally that the agency’s  rejection of its final 
proposal revision was unreasonable, we disagree.  The solicitation indicated that “[a]ll proposals will be evaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements 
set forth in the solicitation” and that “[a] technical proposal must be found to be 
acceptable in all areas to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.”  RFP at 4.  Under these circumstances, the agency reasonably rejected API’s proposal for failing to include the required Buy American certification.  It is an offeror ’s 
responsibility to submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that 
clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements.  FitNet Purchasing Alliance , B-410797, Feb. 12, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 78 at 4 (finding reasonable t he 
agency’s rejection of a  vendor’s quot ation for failing to include a  required Buy American 
certification).  We see no basis to fault the agency for enforcing the very terms of the solicitation requirement , discussed repeatedly with API , after API submitted a proposal 
that again omitted the required Buy American certification.  
 
Interested Party Dismissal  
 
The protester also alleges the agency erred by assessing API’s proposal as technically unacceptable for failing to meet the solicitation’s minimum relative humidity requirement and by not allowing API to submit a revised proposal, as was previously  permitted .  See 
Protest at 1- 3.  API further submits that the agency may have engaged in disparate 
 
9 We note that the agency  was not  obliged to re open discussions  to allow API to submit 
the correct Buy American certification.  Discussions, when conducted, must identify proposal deficiencies and significant weaknesses that could be addressed to materially enhance the offeror’s potential for receiving award.  Serco Inc. , B-405280, Oct. 12, 
2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 237 at 11.  However, agencies are not required to reopen 
discussions to afford offeror s an additional opportunity to revise its proposal where a 
weakness or deficiency is first introduced in the firm’s revised proposal.   See, e.g., 
MetalCraft Marine, Inc., B -410199, B -410199.2, Nov. 13, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 338 at 10.  
Moreover, the Navy here notified API that the agency “i ntend[ed] to make award without 
any further discussions or obtaining further proposal revisions.”  AR, Tab 22, Req.  for 
Final Proposal Revision at 1.   Since API failed to submit the required Buy American 
certificate with its final proposal revision, the agency had no obligation to reopen discussions with API and allow another opportunity for a final proposal revision.

Hexagon but not API.  Id . at 3 -4.  We do not need to resolve these issues, however, 
because we find that API is not an interested party to pursue its remaining challenges 
since API’s proposal fails to conform to a material solicitation requirement, rendering the  
proposal technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.10 
 Under the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, only an interested party may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. §§ 3551- 3557.  That is, 
a protester must be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest 
would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract.  4 C.F.R.           
§ 21.0(a)(1).  In the post -award context, we have generally found that a protester is an 
interested party to challenge an agency’s evaluation of proposals only where there is a 
reasonable possibility that the protester would be next in line for award if its protest were sustained.  CACI, Inc. -Fed., B-419499, Mar. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD ¶ 125 at 5.  A 
protester is therefore not an interested party if it would not be eligible to receive a 
contract award were its protest allegations sustained.  Win Aviation, Inc. , B-422037, 
B-422037.2, Dec. 21, 2023, 2024 CPD ¶ 12 at 6.  In a negotiated procurement, such as 
this one, a proposal that fails to conform to the materi al terms and conditions of the 
solicitation is considered unacceptable and may not form the basis for award.  PAE 
Applied Techs., LLC , B-419133, Nov. 4, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 363 at 4.  
Here, even if API were to prevail on its challenges to the agency’s  evaluation of the 
solicitation’s minimum relative humidity requirement, the protester would not be next in line for award.  In this regard,  as noted above,  we find the agency reasonably rejected 
API’s proposal for omitting the required Buy American certificate from its final proposal revision.  See FitNet Purchasing Alliance, supra at 4.  We note further that the Navy 
received a second technically acceptable proposal  in response to the RFP.   AR, Tab 26, 
SSD at 2-3.  Where there are intervening offerors who would be in line for award even if 
 
10 Even if we were to consider these allegations, however, we see no reason to question 
the agency’s evaluation of API’s proposal as technically unacceptable and no evidence 
of disparate treatment.  As noted above, the agency initially determined that API’s proposed Radian Plus model did not meet the solicitation’s humidity level  requirement  
of 0-95 percent .  COS/MOL at 4 -6.  After the Navy identified the express conflict 
between the product specifications included in API’s initial proposal and the solicitation’s 
humidity requirement, API submitted an updated brochure showing a humidity level of 0-95 percent for the Radian Plus model.  AR, Tab 11, API Revised Proposal, March 14 
at 4.  When API submitted its final proposal revision, however, API included a product 
brochure for a new product (the iLTx laser tracker) showing a relative humidity level at 10-95 percent, which the agency again noted conflicted with the solicitation’s mini mum 
relative humidity requirement of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 26, SSD at 2; COS/MOL at 6.  
In contrast, the product specifications included in Hexagon’s proposal were consistent with other aspects of Hexagon’s technical proposal affirming compliance with the 
solicitation’s humidity percentage requirements, see AR, Tab 3, Hexagon Proposal at 6, 
166, and, unlike API’s proposal, Hexagon’s proposal did not include product 
specifications in direct conflict with the solicitation’s humidity  percentage requirement.    Page 9 B-422063.2  the protester’s challenges were sustained, we generally consider the protester’s interest 
to be too remote to qualify as an interested party.  See, e.g., HCR Constr., Inc.; Southern Aire Contracting, Inc. , B-418070.4, B -418070.5, May 8, 2020, 2020 CPD  
¶ 166 at 6- 7 n.6.  Accordingly, we conclude that API is not an interested party for 
purposes of challenging the agency’s evaluation of the technical proposals submitted by API and Hexagon.    The protest is d enied in part and dismissed  in part.
