The protester contends that the agency failed to evaluate quotations in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  We dismiss the protest in part and deny it in part.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the subject solicitation to General Services Administration schedule contract holders in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 8.405- 2 as a set -aside for small businesses.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s St atement (COS) at  1; Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, RFQ at  15, 168.\n1  The \nagency sought a vendor to provide role player support services as part of training exercises for  the TSA, Federal Air Marshal Service, Federal Flight Deck Officer \nrecurrent training programs, and the TSA Canine Training Center.  RFQ at 78.   The \nsolicitation anticipated the issuance of a hybrid task order with time- and-materials and \nfixed -price contract line item numbers for a base period of one year and four, 1 -year \noption periods.  Id.  at 21, 88.  The due date for quotations, as amended, was \nMay 13, 2024.  COS at  2. \n \nThe solicitation anticipated issuance of the order to the vendor submitting the lowest -\npriced, technically acceptable (LPTA) quotation based on the following factors:  \ntechnical approach, past performance, and price.  RFQ at  168.  Under the technical \napproach factor, vendors were to provide a service plan and a transition- in plan that the \nagency would evaluate to determine whether the vendor quoted an executable \napproach or a non- executable approach to the requirement.  Id.  at 170.  Under the past \nperformance f actor, vendors were to complete a past performance questionnaire that \nthe agency would evaluate to determine whether the vendor demonstrated \u201ca history of developing and delivering satisfactory services\/products in the areas described in the \nsolicitation ( or areas similar in size, scope and complexity to the solicitation and the \n[statement of work (SOW)]).\u201d  Id. at 168-170.  The agency would assign quotations a \nrating of acceptable or unacceptable under the technical approach and past \nperformance factors.  Id. at 170.  The agency would evaluate price by adding the total \nprice for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Id. at 171. \n \nThe agency received two quotations, from NARCORPS  and Vertical Jobs  respectively, \nby the due date on May  13.  COS at  2.  The agency issued the task order to Vertical \nJobs on August 22, 2024.  Id.   NARCORPS filed a protest with our Office on August  30, \nchallenging the agency\u2019s evaluation of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation.  Id.   In response, the \nagency informed our Office that it intended to take corrective action.  Id.   Specifically, \nthe agency stated that it would cancel the task order, amend the RFQ, request and \nevaluate revised quotations, and make a new source selection decision.  Id.   Based on \nthe agency\u2019s proposed corrective action, our Office dismissed the protest as academic \non September 16.  NARCORPS Specialties, LLC, B-422886, Sept. 16, 2024 \n(unpublished decision).  \n \nFollowing the agency\u2019s corrective action, the new due date for quotations was \nOctober  2, 2024.  COS at  3.  Both NARCORPS and Vertical Jobs submitted quotations.  \n \n1 All citations reference the Adobe PDF page number.   Page 3 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  Id.  Vertical Jobs quoted a price of $ 36,097,680; NARCORPS quoted a price of \n$37,841,280.  AR, Tab  16, Unsuccessful Vendor Notification at 2.2  Once the agency \ndetermined that Vertical Jobs submitted the lowest price, it evaluated Vertical Jobs\u2019 \ntechnical proposal and concluded that it was technically acceptable.  AR, Tab 14, SSD \nat 1-3.  On December 26, the agency selected Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation for receipt of the \ntask order.  Id. at 3.  This protest followed.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n NARCORPS raises several challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation of quotations.  The \nprotester first contends that agency should have eliminated Vertical Jobs\u2019  quotation \nfrom the competition because its price was unrealistically low  and demonstrated a lack \nof understanding of the requirements .  Protest at  9-13.  The protester next argues that \nthe agency should have assigned Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation a technical rating of \nunacceptable because, according to the protester, Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past perform ance.  Id. at 13-17.  In its supplemental protest, NARCORPS contends that the \nagency failed to properly document its evaluation under the technical approach factor.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  32.  For reasons discussed below, we dismiss the \nprotest in part and deny it in part.\n3 \n Challenge to the Absence of a Price Realism Analysis  \n NARCORPS first argues that the agency should have eliminated Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation from the competition because its quoted price was unrealistically low and reflected a misunderstanding of the requirements.  Protest at  9-10.  In other words, the \nprotest er argues that the agency should have, but failed to, conduct a price realism \nanalysis.  The intervenor requests dismissal of this argument, contending that the solicitation did not require the agency to conduct a price realism analysis.  Intervenor\u2019s Req.  for Dismissal at  1-3. \n Price realism is an assessment of whether prices are too low, such that there may be a  \nrisk of poor performance.  Maxim Healthcare Servs. , Inc. , B-412967.9, B-412967.11, \nJune 25, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 230 at  8.  While an agency may conduct a price realism \nanalysis in awarding a fixed- price or time -and-materials task order for the limited \npurpose of assessing whether a vendor\u2019s low price reflects a lack of technical understand ing or risk, the solicitation must advise vendors that it will conduct such an \nanalysis.  Advanced C4 Solutions , Inc., B-416250.2 et al. , Oct.  2, 2018, 2018 CPD \n\u00b6 344 at  5.  If the solicitation does not contain an express price realism provision, we will \n \n2 The evaluated prices of the two quotations, as adjusted for FAR clause 52.217- 8 \n(Option to Extend Services), were $39,707,448 and $41,642,226 respectively.  AR, Tab 13, Price Evaluation Team Report at 2; AR, Tab 14, Source Selection Decision \n(SSD) at 1.  \n3 Although we do not address every argument raised by the protester, we have \nconsidered them and find none to be meritorious.   Page 4 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  conclude that a solicitation contemplates a price realism evaluation only where the \nsolicitation provides that:  (1) the agency will review prices to determine whether they are so low that they reflect a lack of technical understanding and (2) a quotation can be rejected or assessed technical risk for offering low prices .  Id. at 6.  Absent such \nsolicitation language, agencies are neither required nor permitted to evaluate price realism in awarding a fixed- price contract.  Facility Servs. Mgmt., Inc. , B-420102.3, \nMar. 29, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 93 at 7 . \n In support of its argument that the solicitation required a price realism analysis, the protester argues that the solicitation provided that the agency \u201cmay reject any quote that is evaluated to be non- compliant with the solicitation requirements or reflec ts a failure to \ncomprehend the complexity and risks of the work to be performed.\u201d  Protest at  7; see \nRFQ at  172.  This language, however, does not contain an express provision for a price \nrealism analysis.  Nor does it state that the agency would review pr ices to determine \nwhether they reflect a lack of technical understanding, or that the agency may reject or assess technical risk to quotations for low prices.  As such, we conclude the solicitation does not authorize the agency to conduct a price realism analysis.  We therefore dismiss this protest ground because it fails to provide a valid basis of protest.  See  \nPricewaterhouseCoopers Pub. Sector LLP , B-415129.3, July 31,  2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 272 \nat 1 (dismissing challenge to agency\u2019s failure to conduct a pric e realism analysis where \nthe solicitation did not obligate the agency to perform a price realism evaluation).  \n Challenge to Past Performance Evaluation  \n The protester  next argues that the agency should have assigned Vertical Jobs\u2019 \nquotation a technical rating of unacceptable because, according to the protester, Vertical Jobs  lacks \u201cadequate past performance\u201d as it has \u201cabsolutely no experience \nperforming role- playing services  under contracts of the magnitude described in the \n[s]olicitation.  . . over the past three years[.]\u201d  Protest at  13-15.  The protester also \ncontends, bas ed on its independent research, that the dollar value for Vertical Jobs\u2019 \nprior cont racts is significantly below the value of the current requirement.  Id.  at 15-16. \n The evaluation of a vendor \u2019s past performance is within  the discretion of the contracting \nagency, and we will not substitute our judgment for  reasonably based past performance \nratings.  See Patricio Enters., Inc. , B-412740 et al. , May 26, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 152 at 7.  \nWhere a protester challenges an agency\u2019s  past performance evaluation and source \nselection, we will review the evaluation and award decision to determine if they were \nreasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019 s evaluation criteria and procurement \nstatutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency \u2019s rationale is adequately \ndocumented.  See id.  \n Based on the record, we have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation.  Contrary to the protester\u2019s argument that Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past performance in role-playing services that are comparable in size to the subject procurement, Vertical \nJobs\u2019 quotation included a reference to a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for role-playing services for the Department of Justice with a 5- year period of performance  Page 5 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  and a total value of $5,000, 000, a BPA for role -playing services for DHS with a 1- year \nperiod of performance and a total value of $2,149,840, and a BPA for role- playing \nservices for the Department of State with a 5- year period of performance and a total \nvalue of $7,000,000.  AR, Tab 10, Vertical Jobs\u2019 Past Performance Quotation at  1-5.  In \nevaluating these references, the technical evaluation team (TET) report documented \nthat Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation \u201cdemonstrated multiple Role Player task orders, with several different Government agencies, running concurrently, each with valuations in the several millions and combined values at tens of millions.\u201d  AR, Tab  12, TET Report \nat 5.  The TET report further noted that the agency spoke with representatives from two \nof Vertical Jobs\u2019 submitted references and concluded that, in both instances, their performance received positive feedback and the references closely aligned with the agency \u2019s current training needs.  Id.   The agency\u2019s independent review of the \nContractor Performance Assessment Repor ting System also supported these findings.  \nSee id.  at 5-6.  Therefore, the protester\u2019s contention that Vertical Jobs has no \ncomparable experience is unsupported by the evaluation record.  This protest ground is denied.\n4 \n Challenge to Technical Approach Evaluation  \n In its supplemental protest, the protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation under the technical approach factor, arguing there \u201cis not sufficient documentation or detail to enable the GAO to review TSA\u2019s actions, much less  \nto determine if they were reasonable.\u201d  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37.  According \nto the protester, the agency\u2019s evaluation of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation \u201cconsists largely of a regurgitation of the terms of the [s]olicitation and SOW\u201d and a \u201cparroting\u201d of language \nfrom Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation.  Id.  at 33-34.  The agency contends that the evaluation \nwas both reasonable and well -documented, but the protester \u201ccherry -picks\u201d portions of \nthe TET report to support its argument.  Supp. MOL at  1. \n \n \n4 The protester raises a substantively identical challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of \ncorporate experience, arguing that \u201c[a] similar analysis\u201d can be applied to both its \nchallenge of the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation and the corporate experience evaluation.  See Protest at  13-17.  As the agency points out that, however , the \nevaluation of a vendor\u2019s corporate experience was \u201csimply not a part of the RFQ.\u201d  \nMemorandum of Law (MOL)  at 4.  Although the protester cites the SOW as the basis for \nits argument that the solicitation required an evaluation of corporate experience, it is clear from the terms of the solicitation that corporate experience was not an evaluation factor.  RFQ at  168.  Instead, the solicitation provided only for the evaluation of a \nvendor\u2019s technical approach, past performance, and price.  Id.  We therefore dismiss \nthis protest ground for failure to state a valid basis of protest as the solicitation here did not contemplate an evaluation of corporate experience.  See Brackett Aircraft Radio Co., B-246282, Jan. 8, 1992, 92- 1 CPD \u00b6 43 at 2 (dismissing allegation as failing to \nstate valid basis when the allegation did not, on its face, demonstrate improper agency action).   Page 6 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  Based on our review of the record, we find the agency\u2019s evaluation reasonable.  While \nthe protester cites Bio -Rad Labs., Inc. , B-297553, Feb.  15, 2006, 2007 CPD \u00b6 58 for the \nproposition that an agency cannot simply \u201cparrot back\u201d definitional language from the solicitation in conducting its evaluation, that decision makes clear that our Office took issue with the fact that the evaluation record, in a FAR part 15 procur ement, was \n\u201cdevoid of any meaningful documentation.\u201d  Id.  at 11.  The current facts are mar kedly \ndifferent.  Here, the subject solicitation provided for the evaluation of quotations on an LPTA basis, meaning that the agency needed to determine only whether the vendor\u2019s approach met the requirements of the solicitation.  RFQ at  170.  The record r eflects that \nthe agency satisfied that standard.  \n For instance, the solicitation provided that vendors \u201cmust be experienced in providing role player support services[.]\u201d  RFQ at  78.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs\u2019 service plan, the \nagency noted that Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation demonstrated twenty -two years of law \nenforcement\/canine role- playing experience .  AR, Tab 12, TET Report at 3.   Similarly, \nfor the transition -in plan, the solicitation required vendors to \u201cdevelop and implement the \ndetailed transition strategies and processes needed to enable an efficient  transfer of \nservices[.]\u201d  RFQ at 87.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation, the agency noted that \nVertical Jobs would \u201ccommence a 60- day transition period in order to ensure that \nmission and operational requirement are fully positioned to maintain conti nuous \ncoverage without any interruption[.]\u201d  AR, Tab  12, TET Report at  4.  The protester\u2019s \nargument that the agency quoted portions of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation and the solicitation in conducting the evaluation does not, in itself, prove that the evaluation was \nunreasonable or lacked adequate documentation.  Instead, the record reflects that the agency considered whether aspects of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation met the requirements, \nas required by the solicitation.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.\n5 \n The protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n5 The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly document its evaluation of \nVertical Jobs\u2019 past performance.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37-41.  We have \naddressed the adequacy of the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation above, \nconcluding that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unobjectionable.  Accordingly, we do not further address the protester\u2019s argument that the evaluation record lacked adequate documentation in this area.",

The protester also \ncontends, bas ed on its independent research, that the dollar value for Vertical Jobs\u2019 \nprior cont racts is significantly below the value of the current requirement.  Id.  at 15-16. \n The evaluation of a vendor \u2019s past performance is within  the discretion of the contracting \nagency, and we will not substitute our judgment for  reasonably based past performance \nratings.  See Patricio Enters., Inc. , B-412740 et al. , May 26, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 152 at 7.  \nWhere a protester challenges an agency\u2019s  past performance evaluation and source \nselection, we will review the evaluation and award decision to determine if they were \nreasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019 s evaluation criteria and procurement \nstatutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency \u2019s rationale is adequately \ndocumented.  See id.  \n Based on the record, we have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation.  Contrary to the protester\u2019s argument that Vertical Jobs lacks adequate past performance in role-playing services that are comparable in size to the subject procurement, Vertical \nJobs\u2019 quotation included a reference to a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for role-playing services for the Department of Justice with a 5- year period of performance  Page 5 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  and a total value of $5,000, 000, a BPA for role -playing services for DHS with a 1- year \nperiod of performance and a total value of $2,149,840, and a BPA for role- playing \nservices for the Department of State with a 5- year period of performance and a total \nvalue of $7,000,000.  AR, Tab 10, Vertical Jobs\u2019 Past Performance Quotation at  1-5.  In \nevaluating these references, the technical evaluation team (TET) report documented \nthat Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation \u201cdemonstrated multiple Role Player task orders, with several different Government agencies, running concurrently, each with valuations in the several millions and combined values at tens of millions.\u201d  AR, Tab  12, TET Report \nat 5.  The TET report further noted that the agency spoke with representatives from two \nof Vertical Jobs\u2019 submitted references and concluded that, in both instances, their performance received positive feedback and the references closely aligned with the agency \u2019s current training needs.  Id.   The agency\u2019s independent review of the \nContractor Performance Assessment Repor ting System also supported these findings.  \nSee id.  at 5-6.  Therefore, the protester\u2019s contention that Vertical Jobs has no \ncomparable experience is unsupported by the evaluation record.  This protest ground is denied.\n4 \n Challenge to Technical Approach Evaluation  \n In its supplemental protest, the protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation under the technical approach factor, arguing there \u201cis not sufficient documentation or detail to enable the GAO to review TSA\u2019s actions, much less  \nto determine if they were reasonable.\u201d  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37.  According \nto the protester, the agency\u2019s evaluation of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation \u201cconsists largely of a regurgitation of the terms of the [s]olicitation and SOW\u201d and a \u201cparroting\u201d of language \nfrom Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation.  Id.  at 33-34.  The agency contends that the evaluation \nwas both reasonable and well -documented, but the protester \u201ccherry -picks\u201d portions of \nthe TET report to support its argument.  Supp. MOL at  1. \n \n \n4 The protester raises a substantively identical challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of \ncorporate experience, arguing that \u201c[a] similar analysis\u201d can be applied to both its \nchallenge of the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation and the corporate experience evaluation.  See Protest at  13-17.  As the agency points out that, however , the \nevaluation of a vendor\u2019s corporate experience was \u201csimply not a part of the RFQ.\u201d  \nMemorandum of Law (MOL)  at 4.  Although the protester cites the SOW as the basis for \nits argument that the solicitation required an evaluation of corporate experience, it is clear from the terms of the solicitation that corporate experience was not an evaluation factor.  RFQ at  168.  Instead, the solicitation provided only for the evaluation of a \nvendor\u2019s technical approach, past performance, and price.  Id.  We therefore dismiss \nthis protest ground for failure to state a valid basis of protest as the solicitation here did not contemplate an evaluation of corporate experience.  See Brackett Aircraft Radio Co., B-246282, Jan. 8, 1992, 92- 1 CPD \u00b6 43 at 2 (dismissing allegation as failing to \nstate valid basis when the allegation did not, on its face, demonstrate improper agency action).   Page 6 B-422886.2; B -422886.3  Based on our review of the record, we find the agency\u2019s evaluation reasonable.  While \nthe protester cites Bio -Rad Labs., Inc. , B-297553, Feb.  15, 2006, 2007 CPD \u00b6 58 for the \nproposition that an agency cannot simply \u201cparrot back\u201d definitional language from the solicitation in conducting its evaluation, that decision makes clear that our Office took issue with the fact that the evaluation record, in a FAR part 15 procur ement, was \n\u201cdevoid of any meaningful documentation.\u201d  Id.  at 11.  The current facts are mar kedly \ndifferent.  Here, the subject solicitation provided for the evaluation of quotations on an LPTA basis, meaning that the agency needed to determine only whether the vendor\u2019s approach met the requirements of the solicitation.  RFQ at  170.  The record r eflects that \nthe agency satisfied that standard.  \n For instance, the solicitation provided that vendors \u201cmust be experienced in providing role player support services[.]\u201d  RFQ at  78.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs\u2019 service plan, the \nagency noted that Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation demonstrated twenty -two years of law \nenforcement\/canine role- playing experience .  AR, Tab 12, TET Report at 3.   Similarly, \nfor the transition -in plan, the solicitation required vendors to \u201cdevelop and implement the \ndetailed transition strategies and processes needed to enable an efficient  transfer of \nservices[.]\u201d  RFQ at 87.  In evaluating Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation, the agency noted that \nVertical Jobs would \u201ccommence a 60- day transition period in order to ensure that \nmission and operational requirement are fully positioned to maintain conti nuous \ncoverage without any interruption[.]\u201d  AR, Tab  12, TET Report at  4.  The protester\u2019s \nargument that the agency quoted portions of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation and the solicitation in conducting the evaluation does not, in itself, prove that the evaluation was \nunreasonable or lacked adequate documentation.  Instead, the record reflects that the agency considered whether aspects of Vertical Jobs\u2019 quotation met the requirements, \nas required by the solicitation.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.\n5 \n The protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n5 The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly document its evaluation of \nVertical Jobs\u2019 past performance.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  37-41.  We have \naddressed the adequacy of the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation above, \nconcluding that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unobjectionable.  Accordingly, we do not further address the protester\u2019s argument that the evaluation record lacked adequate documentation in this area.  "

        "Summary":"1.  Protest that the agency failed to properly consider organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) is denied where the record shows that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to whether the prospective offeror had OCIs and there is no clear evidence in the record that the agency\u2019s conclusion was unreasonable.  \n 2.  Supplemental protest challenging the adequacy of the agency\u2019s waiver of rules and procedures pertaining to an OCI is dismissed, where the waiver was executed shortly before GAO\u2019s statutory 100- day deadline, our Office was already prepared to conclude \nthat the OCI allegation s had no merit, and GAO\u2019s decision to deny the OCI challenge \nrenders academic the challenge to the waiver.  \n 3.  Protest that solicitation deprives vendors of the ability to compete intelligently is denied where the record shows that the solicitation is drafted in a fashion that enables \nvendors to intelligently  prepare their proposals.  \nDECISION  \n Lockheed Martin Corporation, of Fort Worth, Texas, protests the actions of the Department of the Air Force in connection with fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR)  \nNo. FA8612- 25-R- B001 , issued for  Tactical Operations C enter  - Light (TOC -L) DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.

Lockheed Martin maintains that the agency failed to adequately \ninvestigate and evaluate organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) on the part of \nScience Applications International Corporation (SAIC), of Reston, Virginia,  another \nprospective offeror.  In addition, the protester argues that the FOPR does not provide sufficient information to permit offerors to compete intelligently and fairly.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The Air Force established the distributed battle management node (DBMN) effort to focus on command, control, communications, and battle management capabilities with clear mission value and operational impact by leveraging capabilities from next generation sensors, providing decision support, and if necessary, prosecuting targets \nthat would deny access to an area of operations.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 18, FOPR amend. 5, Statement of Objections (SOO) at 13.\n1  Among the Air Force\u2019s requirements \ndeveloped under the DBMN effort is the TOC -L, a lightweight, scalable mission system \nthat enables tactical command and control elements to quickly relocate, establish datalinks, and connect to a variety of sensors, incl uding military and civilian sources, \njoint coalition, allied, and mission partner networks.  Id.  \n The Air Force has pursued the TOC -L acquisition in two phases.  Id.  The first phase, a \n36-month effort which began in January 2023, includes material procurement of 16 \n\u201cTOC -L experimental systems, integration with sensors,\u201d and delivery to units for \nexperimentation in operational exercises.  Id.   Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor \nfor the first phase.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 15.  \n This protest concerns the second phase (Phase II) of the TOC -L procurement, through \nwhich the Air Force seeks a systems integrator to design, procure, build, test, deliver, and maintain TOC -L prototype systems.  Id.  at 2.  In 2024, the agency issued the first \nversion of the solicitation pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16 under the Air Force\u2019s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) indefinite- delivery, \nindefinite -quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract.\n2  Protest, B -422718, July 3, 2024, \nat 17.  The solicitation provided for a two- step proposal and evaluation process.  Id.  In \nthe first step, offerors submitted white papers.  Id.  at 17 -18.  Based on those white \npapers, the agency selected five offerors, including Lockheed Martin and SAIC, to proceed to the second step of submitting \u201cfull proposal[s].\u201d  Id. at 18; COS at 2.  \n After receiving and evaluating proposals, the agency selected SAIC for award at an estimated price of approximately $293 million.

Among other things, Lockheed Martin alleged \nthat the agency had failed to conduct a reasonable assessment of SAIC\u2019s alleged OCIs.  Lockheed Martin Corp. , supra.  \n In response to the protests, the agency notified our Office that it would take corrective action by amending the solicitation, \u201creceive updated proposals, evaluate updated proposals, and make a new award decision,\u201d as well as \u201cinvestigate the alleged\u201d OCIs .  \nId.  As a result, on July 30, 2024, we dismissed the prior protests of the issuance of the \ntask order to SAIC as academic.   Id.; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra . \n Following dismissal of the protests, the agency investigated whether OCIs existed for any of the five offerors, and \u201chow to resolve such conflicts.\u201d  AR, Tab 12, OCI Determination and Findings (D&F) at 1.  This inquiry included requesting OCI mitigation plans from offerors.  See  AR, Tab 5, Request for OCI Mitigation Plan at 1.  At the \nconclusion of the investigation, the contracting officer determined that the offerors --\nincluding SAIC and Lockheed Martin--did not have \u201cactual OCIs\u201d and \u201cany potential OCI has been mitigated by the offerors and the government\u201d such that no offeror was precluded from competing.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 23.  \n Subsequently, on November 16, the Air Force issued the current solicitation, now identified as FOPR No.  FA8612- 25-R-B001, as \u201can amendment\u201d to the initial Phase II \nsolicitation ( FA8612- 24-R-B000).  AR, Tab  13, FOPR at 80.  The new FOPR is limited \nto resoliciting step- two proposals from the five offerors that had previously been \nselected to proceed.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at  5.  The FOPR contemplates the \nissuance of one or more cost -plus-fixed -fee task orders with 2- year terms and various \noptions.  Id.  at 5.   \n The solicitation provides that the source selection will be made on a best -value tradeoff \nbasis considering technical approach and cost factors.  Id. at 13.  The technical \napproach factor has three equally important subfactors:  (1) program management approach; (2) system engineering approach; and (3) existing prototype system.  Id.   \nCost is to be evaluated for realism, reasonableness, and balance. Id.  at 15.  As relevant \nto this protest, offerors must address, among other things, a requirement to integrate third-party software provided as government -furnished equipment (GFE) --specifically \n\u201cRaytheon Solipsys Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3)\u201d --and any \n\u201ccontractor proposed software\u201d to meet the technical requirements identified in the FOPR\u2019s system  requirements document (SRD).  AR, Tab 18, FOPR amend.  5 at 24.  \n  Page 4 B-423294  The FOPR established a proposal deadline of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 23, \n2025.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at 6.  Lockheed Martin filed this protest on January  23, prior to the submission deadline.\n3 \n DISCUSSION \n \nLockheed Martin asserts that SAIC should be eliminated from the competition due to \nunmitigated OCIs.  In addition, Lockheed Martin argues that the solicitation fails to provide sufficient information for offerors to prepare their proposals on an intelligent and equal basis.  Although we do not specifically address all of Lockheed Martin\u2019s \narguments, we have considered them all and find that none affords a basis to sustain \nthe protest.  \n \nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest  \n The protester claims that SAIC has unmitigated OCIs.   Comments at 8- 29.  Specifically, \nthe protester alleges that SAIC\u2019s role--under a separate contract --as the cloud- based \ncommand and control (CBC2) software integrator for the Air Force, as well as SAIC\u2019s membership in the Digital Infrastructure (DI) Consor tium,\n4 give rise to an impaired \nobjectivity OCI and an unequal access to information OCI.5  Protest at 11- 12, 24- 43.  In \nLockheed Martin\u2019s view, had the agency properly investigated these OCIs, SAIC would have been deemed ineligible for award.  Id.  at 24- 43.  The agency, in response to the \nearlier protests of this procurement, conducted an OCI investigation and determined that SAIC has no \u201cactual OCIs\u201d and \u201cany potential OCI has been mitigated.\u201d  AR, \nTab 12, OCI D&F at 23.   \n \nThe FAR requires that contracting officials avoid, neutralize, or mitigate potential \nsignificant conflicts of interest to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the \n \n3 The task order has an expected value exceeding $3 5 million and is therefore within \nour jurisdiction to review protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award \nIDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code. \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n4 According to the protester, the DI Consortium is \u201cthe group of contractors that are \nresponsible for the development of the DI architecture, digital models, and hardware \nsolutions that will be provided as GFE\u201d for this task order.  Protest at 11- 12. \n5 Lockheed Martin initially argued that SAIC also suffers from an unmitigable biased \nground rules OCI.  Protest at 43- 45.  The agency substantively responded to the \nallegation in the agency report, arguing that the Air Force had appropriately considered and mitigated any potential biased ground rules OCI.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) \nat 22-23.  In its comments on the agency report, Lockheed Martin neither rebutted nor \nresponded to the agency\u2019s response.  As such, we find the allegation to be abandoned and will n ot consider it further.   4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3(i)(3); Medical Staffing Sols.

The situations in which OCIs arise, as described in FAR subpart 9.5 and the \ndecisions of our Office, can be categorized into three groups: (1) biased ground rules; \n(2) unequal access to information; and (3)  impaired objectivity.

FAR 9.504.  In reviewing protests that challenge an agency\u2019s conflict of interest  \ndetermination, our Office reviews the reasonableness of the contracting officer\u2019s investigation.  Where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether an OCI exists--even when this consideration is given after award --we will not substitute our \njudgment for the agency\u2019s, absent clear evidence that the agency\u2019s conclusion is \nunreasonable.

Comments at 8 -25.  According to the protester, as the CBC2 software \nintegr ator, \u201cSAIC would have a potential impaired objectivity OCI with respect to its \nservice as both the CBC2 software integrator and the DBMN Phase II contractor at the same time,\u201d based on SAIC\u2019s performance of systems engineering work under the CBC2 contract .  Id. at 9-13. \n As relevant here, an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm \u2019s ability to render \nimpartial advice to the government in connection with an evaluation of its own products or services, or those of a competitor, is impaired because of the firm \u2019s competing \ninterests.  FAR 9.505- 3; Serco Inc. , B-404033 et al. , Dec. 27, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6 302 \nat 2.  The concern in such impaired objectivity situations is that a firm \u2019s ability to render \nimpartial advice to the government will be undermined by the firm \u2019s competing interests.  \nPURVIS Sys., Inc. , B-293807.3, B -293807.4, Aug. 16, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 177 at 7.    \n During its OCI investigation, the Air Force recognized that the scope of work for SAIC, in its role as the CBC2 software integrator, includes \u201csystems engineering\u201d and other support.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 3.  As a starting point for the agency\u2019s OCI anal ysis, \nthe contracting officer provides the following:   \n \nSystems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  determining specifications, identifying and resolving  Page 6 B-423294  interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, \nand supervising design.  Technical direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  developing work statements,  \ndetermining parameters, directing other contractors\u2019 operations, and resolving technical controversies.  In performing these activities, a contractor occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a system\u2019s basic concepts and superv ising their execution by \nother contractors. Therefore, this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.   \n Id. at 8 (quoting FAR 9.505- 1(b)).   \n In reviewing the performance work statement for the CBC2 software integrator contract, the agency noted that the software integrator\u2019s role does implicate at least some of these activities that could influence the instant task order for the TOC -L system, \nincluding identifying and resolving interface problems, evaluating design, and \nsupervising design.  Id.  at 15- 16.  Because the \u201c CBC2 software is a key subsystem \u201d for \nthe TOC -L system, and the agency expects the contractor under the Phase II \nsolicitation \u201cto  provide impartial advice on risk associated with integration of TOC -L and \nCBC2,\u201d the Air Force recognized there \u201cis at least a perception that SAIC may provide advice that is more favorable to their own product.\u201d  Id.  at 17.  The contracting officer \nfound, however, that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated by the Air Force\u2019s systems engineering and design review processes.   Specifically, the Air Force identified \nthe following factors as mitigating potential conflicts:  (1) the agency\u2019s ownership of t he \ntechnical direction and approval authority for all TOC -L products; (2) the notice to all \nofferors that CBC2 software will be provided as GFE at a future time, and will not be \nevaluated as satisfying any particular SRD requirement under the Phase II FOPR ; and \n(3) the agency\u2019s retention of final approval authority for all recommendations made by SAIC under the CBC2 contract.  Id. at 17- 18. \n Lockheed Martin, for its part, acknowledges that the agency did review, and identify, a potential impaired objectivity based on the interplay between SAIC\u2019s CBC2 software integrator work and the TOC -L system task order here.  Comments at 12- 13.  Lockheed \nMartin asserts, however, that the agency\u2019s identified measures are \u201cinadequate\u201d to \nmitigate the OCI.  Id.  at 13- 25.  According to Lockheed Martin, the agency \u201cerroneously \nconcluded that because SAIC would only participate in--as opposed to having final responsibility for --evaluating software that it would integrate with CBC2 for [this task \norder], SAIC does not have an impaired objectivity OCI.\u201d  Comments at 15.  In other words, Lockheed Martin insists that the Air Force is improperly relying on its final approval or decision- making authority as a talisman to assert that no impaired \nobjectivity OCI exists, citing our decision in Safal Partners , where we found the \ncontracting officer\u2019s OCI analysis applied an improper legal standard to the facts of that decisi on.  See Safal Partners, Inc. , B-416937, B -416937.2, Jan. 15, 2019, 2019 CPD \n\u00b6 20 at 9.   \n  Page 7 B-423294  Here, however, unlike in Safal Partners , the record reflects that the agency considered \nthe scope and nature of the systems engineering responsibilities SAIC holds under the \nCBC2 contract to find that there was at least a possibility of an impaired objectivity OCI.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 17.  Considering the scope and nature of those responsibilities, the agency compared the possibility for biased recommendations against the implementation of detailed measures in a government system engineering plan for any DBMN requirement, with six defined technical design reviews to \u201cserve as decision gates for design evolution, enabling data- driven and performance- based solutions to \ntechnical problems.\u201d  See  id. at 10.  Based on the facts and circumstances of the \npotential for impartial advice from SAIC in the CBC2 or TOC -L efforts, and the \ngovernment\u2019s specific efforts to exercise independent oversight and ultimate decision-making authority under each effort, the contracting officer found that government control mitigat ed the potential OCI concerns here.  Id. at 17- 18. \n Moreover, the contracting officer did not rely on government control alone to find that the OCI was mitigated.  Instead, the Air Force purposefully changed its approach to the procurement, specifying that CBC2 software will not be evaluated as satisfying any particular requirement of the SRD, and that any associated software will be provided as GFE through Air Force contracting channels.  Id. at 17.  Lockheed Martin argues that \nSAIC would nonetheless \u201cbe in a position to exercise subjective judgment that favors its own performance.\u201d  Comments at 19.  The various hypothetical scenarios imagined by the protester to support its argument reflect a misconstruing of work at issue in light of the mitigation measures that the agency has carefully constructed and explained.  Simply put, although Lockheed Martin believes that it would be possible for SAIC to continue to advance its own interests rather than offering objective advice to the \nagency, that belief is insufficient to upset the agency\u2019s different, well -documented \nunderstanding.

This allegation is therefore denied.  \n  Unequal Access to Information \n The protester also challenges the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s assessment of an alleged unequal access to information OCI associated with SAIC\u2019s work on the CBC2 contract and as a member of the DI Consortium.  Comments at 25- 29.  The agency \nasserts that no offeror gained an unfair competitive advantage by their access to nonpublic information.  MOL at 7.  \n  Page 8 B-423294  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic \ninformation as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm a competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmen t contract.

AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  Lockheed Martin does not as sert that this release of information was insufficient to mitigate the alleged \nunequal access to information OCI.  \n Instead, Lockheed Martin contests the adequacy of SAIC\u2019s firewall.  Lockheed Martin \nargues that the agency\u2019s analysis did not go far enough because the agency did not \nask--in the protester\u2019s estimation--sufficient follow- up questions about the nature and \nextent of a firewall that SAIC erected between its CBC2 team and the proposal team \nunder this solicitation.   Comments at 25- 29.  However, because the contracting officer \nidentified two separate ways in which the potential for unequal access was mitigated--the release of information in the Bidder\u2019s Library and SAIC\u2019s firewall --by failing to \nchallenge the adequacy  of the release of information in the Bidder\u2019s Library, Lockheed \nMartin cannot demonstrate harm from its concerns about the adequacy of SAIC\u2019s firewall.

A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment concerning the agency\u2019s needs and how to accommodate them does not show that the agency\u2019s judgment is unreasonable.  Apogee Eng\u2019 g, LLC, supra.  \n Notwithstanding Lockheed Martin\u2019s request for additional information, our review confirms that the solicitation has adequately defined its requirements and provided sufficient information to offerors.  Within the solicitation materials provided to all offerors, is an \u201cSRD gap analysis\u201d that identifies --by number description--each relevant SRD \nrequirement, and then provides an assessment of whether the BC3 software as it currently exists satisfies the requirement (completely or partially) or does not satisfy  the \nrequirement.

The solicitation also includes \nthe \u201cBC3 Integration Plan\u201d that describes the BC3 technology, identifying key technical specifications, integration timeline and responsibilities, and planned testing and validation efforts.  AR, Tab 13, FOPR at  522-26. \n Although Lockheed Martin acknowledges that the information in the solicitation \u201ctells the offeror where (in terms of the SRD) there are holes in the architectures or the critical BC3 software products,\u201d the protester complains that there the agency has not  provided \nmore about the places where the software only partially satisfies requirements or how much effort will be needed to integrate the BC3 software, provided as GFE, and any software the contractors propose to provide into the TOC -L systems.  Comments  \nat 41-42.  Notwithstanding the protester\u2019s dissatisfaction, we find nothing objectionable \nwith the Air Force\u2019s assessment that the information provided in the solicitation --\napparently all that exists --combined with the offerors\u2019 business judgment, is suff icient for  Page 11 B-423294  offerors to intelligently prepare and assess the cost of their own strategy to meet the \nagency\u2019s needs here.

Lockheed Martin maintains that the agency failed to adequately \ninvestigate and evaluate organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) on the part of \nScience Applications International Corporation (SAIC), of Reston, Virginia,  another \nprospective offeror.  In addition, the protester argues that the FOPR does not provide sufficient information to permit offerors to compete intelligently and fairly.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The Air Force established the distributed battle management node (DBMN) effort to focus on command, control, communications, and battle management capabilities with clear mission value and operational impact by leveraging capabilities from next generation sensors, providing decision support, and if necessary, prosecuting targets \nthat would deny access to an area of operations.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 18, FOPR amend. 5, Statement of Objections (SOO) at 13.\n1  Among the Air Force\u2019s requirements \ndeveloped under the DBMN effort is the TOC -L, a lightweight, scalable mission system \nthat enables tactical command and control elements to quickly relocate, establish datalinks, and connect to a variety of sensors, incl uding military and civilian sources, \njoint coalition, allied, and mission partner networks.  Id.  \n The Air Force has pursued the TOC -L acquisition in two phases.  Id.  The first phase, a \n36-month effort which began in January 2023, includes material procurement of 16 \n\u201cTOC -L experimental systems, integration with sensors,\u201d and delivery to units for \nexperimentation in operational exercises.  Id.   Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor \nfor the first phase.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 15.  \n This protest concerns the second phase (Phase II) of the TOC -L procurement, through \nwhich the Air Force seeks a systems integrator to design, procure, build, test, deliver, and maintain TOC -L prototype systems.  Id.  at 2.  In 2024, the agency issued the first \nversion of the solicitation pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16 under the Air Force\u2019s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) indefinite- delivery, \nindefinite -quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract.\n2  Protest, B -422718, July 3, 2024, \nat 17.

Among other things, Lockheed Martin alleged \nthat the agency had failed to conduct a reasonable assessment of SAIC\u2019s alleged OCIs.  Lockheed Martin Corp. , supra.  \n In response to the protests, the agency notified our Office that it would take corrective action by amending the solicitation, \u201creceive updated proposals, evaluate updated proposals, and make a new award decision,\u201d as well as \u201cinvestigate the alleged\u201d OCIs .  \nId.  As a result, on July 30, 2024, we dismissed the prior protests of the issuance of the \ntask order to SAIC as academic.   Id.; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra . \n Following dismissal of the protests, the agency investigated whether OCIs existed for any of the five offerors, and \u201chow to resolve such conflicts.\u201d  AR, Tab 12, OCI Determination and Findings (D&F) at 1.  This inquiry included requesting OCI mitigation plans from offerors.  See  AR, Tab 5, Request for OCI Mitigation Plan at 1.  At the \nconclusion of the investigation, the contracting officer determined that the offerors --\nincluding SAIC and Lockheed Martin--did not have \u201cactual OCIs\u201d and \u201cany potential OCI has been mitigated by the offerors and the government\u201d such that no offeror was precluded from competing.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 23.  \n Subsequently, on November 16, the Air Force issued the current solicitation, now identified as FOPR No.  FA8612- 25-R-B001, as \u201can amendment\u201d to the initial Phase II \nsolicitation ( FA8612- 24-R-B000).  AR, Tab  13, FOPR at 80.  The new FOPR is limited \nto resoliciting step- two proposals from the five offerors that had previously been \nselected to proceed.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at  5.  The FOPR contemplates the \nissuance of one or more cost -plus-fixed -fee task orders with 2- year terms and various \noptions.  Id.  at 5.   \n The solicitation provides that the source selection will be made on a best -value tradeoff \nbasis considering technical approach and cost factors.  Id. at 13.  The technical \napproach factor has three equally important subfactors:  (1) program management approach; (2) system engineering approach; and (3) existing prototype system.  Id.   \nCost is to be evaluated for realism, reasonableness, and balance. Id.  at 15.  As relevant \nto this protest, offerors must address, among other things, a requirement to integrate third-party software provided as government -furnished equipment (GFE) --specifically \n\u201cRaytheon Solipsys Battlespace Command and Control Center (BC3)\u201d --and any \n\u201ccontractor proposed software\u201d to meet the technical requirements identified in the FOPR\u2019s system  requirements document (SRD).  AR, Tab 18, FOPR amend.  5 at 24.  \n  Page 4 B-423294  The FOPR established a proposal deadline of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 23, \n2025.  AR, Tab 19, FOPR amend. 6 at 6.  Lockheed Martin filed this protest on January  23, prior to the submission deadline.\n3 \n DISCUSSION \n \nLockheed Martin asserts that SAIC should be eliminated from the competition due to \nunmitigated OCIs.  In addition, Lockheed Martin argues that the solicitation fails to provide sufficient information for offerors to prepare their proposals on an intelligent and equal basis.  Although we do not specifically address all of Lockheed Martin\u2019s \narguments, we have considered them all and find that none affords a basis to sustain \nthe protest.  \n \nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest  \n The protester claims that SAIC has unmitigated OCIs.   Comments at 8- 29.  Specifically, \nthe protester alleges that SAIC\u2019s role--under a separate contract --as the cloud- based \ncommand and control (CBC2) software integrator for the Air Force, as well as SAIC\u2019s membership in the Digital Infrastructure (DI) Consor tium,\n4 give rise to an impaired \nobjectivity OCI and an unequal access to information OCI.5  Protest at 11- 12, 24- 43.  In \nLockheed Martin\u2019s view, had the agency properly investigated these OCIs, SAIC would have been deemed ineligible for award.  Id.  at 24- 43.  The agency, in response to the \nearlier protests of this procurement, conducted an OCI investigation and determined that SAIC has no \u201cactual OCIs\u201d and \u201cany potential OCI has been mitigated.\u201d  AR, \nTab 12, OCI D&F at 23.   \n \nThe FAR requires that contracting officials avoid, neutralize, or mitigate potential \nsignificant conflicts of interest to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the \n \n3 The task order has an expected value exceeding $3 5 million and is therefore within \nour jurisdiction to review protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award \nIDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code. \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n4 According to the protester, the DI Consortium is \u201cthe group of contractors that are \nresponsible for the development of the DI architecture, digital models, and hardware \nsolutions that will be provided as GFE\u201d for this task order.

As a starting point for the agency\u2019s OCI anal ysis, \nthe contracting officer provides the following:   \n \nSystems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  determining specifications, identifying and resolving  Page 6 B-423294  interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, \nand supervising design.  Technical direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities:  developing work statements,  \ndetermining parameters, directing other contractors\u2019 operations, and resolving technical controversies.  In performing these activities, a contractor occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a system\u2019s basic concepts and superv ising their execution by \nother contractors. Therefore, this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.   \n Id. at 8 (quoting FAR 9.505- 1(b)).   \n In reviewing the performance work statement for the CBC2 software integrator contract, the agency noted that the software integrator\u2019s role does implicate at least some of these activities that could influence the instant task order for the TOC -L system, \nincluding identifying and resolving interface problems, evaluating design, and \nsupervising design.  Id.  at 15- 16.  Because the \u201c CBC2 software is a key subsystem \u201d for \nthe TOC -L system, and the agency expects the contractor under the Phase II \nsolicitation \u201cto  provide impartial advice on risk associated with integration of TOC -L and \nCBC2,\u201d the Air Force recognized there \u201cis at least a perception that SAIC may provide advice that is more favorable to their own product.\u201d  Id.  at 17.  The contracting officer \nfound, however, that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated by the Air Force\u2019s systems engineering and design review processes.   Specifically, the Air Force identified \nthe following factors as mitigating potential conflicts:  (1) the agency\u2019s ownership of t he \ntechnical direction and approval authority for all TOC -L products; (2) the notice to all \nofferors that CBC2 software will be provided as GFE at a future time, and will not be \nevaluated as satisfying any particular SRD requirement under the Phase II FOPR ; and \n(3) the agency\u2019s retention of final approval authority for all recommendations made by SAIC under the CBC2 contract.  Id. at 17- 18. \n Lockheed Martin, for its part, acknowledges that the agency did review, and identify, a potential impaired objectivity based on the interplay between SAIC\u2019s CBC2 software integrator work and the TOC -L system task order here.  Comments at 12- 13.  Lockheed \nMartin asserts, however, that the agency\u2019s identified measures are \u201cinadequate\u201d to \nmitigate the OCI.  Id.  at 13- 25.  According to Lockheed Martin, the agency \u201cerroneously \nconcluded that because SAIC would only participate in--as opposed to having final responsibility for --evaluating software that it would integrate with CBC2 for [this task \norder], SAIC does not have an impaired objectivity OCI.\u201d  Comments at 15.  In other words, Lockheed Martin insists that the Air Force is improperly relying on its final approval or decision- making authority as a talisman to assert that no impaired \nobjectivity OCI exists, citing our decision in Safal Partners , where we found the \ncontracting officer\u2019s OCI analysis applied an improper legal standard to the facts of that decisi on.  See Safal Partners, Inc. , B-416937, B -416937.2, Jan. 15, 2019, 2019 CPD \n\u00b6 20 at 9.   \n  Page 7 B-423294  Here, however, unlike in Safal Partners , the record reflects that the agency considered \nthe scope and nature of the systems engineering responsibilities SAIC holds under the \nCBC2 contract to find that there was at least a possibility of an impaired objectivity OCI.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 17.  Considering the scope and nature of those responsibilities, the agency compared the possibility for biased recommendations against the implementation of detailed measures in a government system engineering plan for any DBMN requirement, with six defined technical design reviews to \u201cserve as decision gates for design evolution, enabling data- driven and performance- based solutions to \ntechnical problems.\u201d  See  id. at 10.  Based on the facts and circumstances of the \npotential for impartial advice from SAIC in the CBC2 or TOC -L efforts, and the \ngovernment\u2019s specific efforts to exercise independent oversight and ultimate decision-making authority under each effort, the contracting officer found that government control mitigat ed the potential OCI concerns here.  Id. at 17- 18. \n Moreover, the contracting officer did not rely on government control alone to find that the OCI was mitigated.  Instead, the Air Force purposefully changed its approach to the procurement, specifying that CBC2 software will not be evaluated as satisfying any particular requirement of the SRD, and that any associated software will be provided as GFE through Air Force contracting channels.  Id. at 17.  Lockheed Martin argues that \nSAIC would nonetheless \u201cbe in a position to exercise subjective judgment that favors its own performance.\u201d  Comments at 19.  The various hypothetical scenarios imagined by the protester to support its argument reflect a misconstruing of work at issue in light of the mitigation measures that the agency has carefully constructed and explained.  Simply put, although Lockheed Martin believes that it would be possible for SAIC to continue to advance its own interests rather than offering objective advice to the \nagency, that belief is insufficient to upset the agency\u2019s different, well -documented \nunderstanding.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC , B-414268.3 et al. , May 30, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6  175 at 8- 10 (denying allegation of impaired objectivity OCI where \ncontractor at issue would not have the level of discretion or requisite decision- making \nauthority implicit in protester\u2019s argument).  \n We find that the contracting officer reasonably assessed the potential for competing roles should SAIC win the task order here and reasonably found that any impaired objectivity OCI was mitigated.  Although the protester essentially expresses disagreement with the contracting officer\u2019s judgments, that provides no basis to find \nthose judgments unreasonable.  Systems Made Simple, Inc. , B-412948.2, July 20, \n2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 207 at 12- 13.  This allegation is therefore denied.  \n  Unequal Access to Information \n The protester also challenges the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s assessment of an alleged unequal access to information OCI associated with SAIC\u2019s work on the CBC2 contract and as a member of the DI Consortium.  Comments at 25- 29.  The agency \nasserts that no offeror gained an unfair competitive advantage by their access to nonpublic information.  MOL at 7.  \n  Page 8 B-423294  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic \ninformation as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm a competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmen t contract.

As the FAR makes clear, the  \nconcern regarding this category of OCIs is that a firm may gain a competitive advantage  based on its possession of \u201f[p]roprietary information that was obtained from a  Government official without proper authorization,\u201d or \u201f[s]ource selection information . . .  \nthat is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and such  information would assist that contractor in obtaining the contract.\u201d  FAR 9.505(b); Superlative Techs., Inc ., supra  at 5. \n As part of the OCI investigation, the contracting officer identified that all \u201cfive (5) offerors have access to nonpublic information due to their performance within PEO C3BM and the ABMS Division.\u201d\n6  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  To aid in its OCI analysis, the agency \ncreated a \u201cBidder\u2019s Library\u201d where the \u201cdetails for each offeror are provided to determine whether an existing contract gives the contractor access to nonpublic information that will give it an unfair competitive advantage over other offerors in the subject acquisition.\u201d  Id.  The agency\u2019s main measure to neutralize or resolve any unfair competitive \nadvantage was the production of \u201ca more complete Bidder\u2019s Library\u201d with information from the CBC2 and DI Consortium efforts.  AR, Tab 12, OCI D&F at 2.  Lockheed Martin does not as sert that this release of information was insufficient to mitigate the alleged \nunequal access to information OCI.  \n Instead, Lockheed Martin contests the adequacy of SAIC\u2019s firewall.  Lockheed Martin \nargues that the agency\u2019s analysis did not go far enough because the agency did not \nask--in the protester\u2019s estimation--sufficient follow- up questions about the nature and \nextent of a firewall that SAIC erected between its CBC2 team and the proposal team \nunder this solicitation.   Comments at 25- 29.  However, because the contracting officer \nidentified two separate ways in which the potential for unequal access was mitigated--the release of information in the Bidder\u2019s Library and SAIC\u2019s firewall --by failing to \nchallenge the adequacy  of the release of information in the Bidder\u2019s Library, Lockheed \nMartin cannot demonstrate harm from its concerns about the adequacy of SAIC\u2019s firewall.

In this case, however, we will not \nfollow that general rule.  Our Office is prepared to conclude that the protester\u2019s OCI allegations have no merit, and since a decision to deny the OCI challenges will render academic any associat ed allegation that the waiver was not properly issued--and given \nour statutory mandate under CICA to provide for the \u201cinexpensive and expeditious\u201d resolution of protests --we deny the protest.  31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(a)(1); see ARP Scis., \nLLC, supra.

A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment concerning the agency\u2019s needs and how to accommodate them does not show that the agency\u2019s judgment is unreasonable.  Apogee Eng\u2019 g, LLC, supra.  \n Notwithstanding Lockheed Martin\u2019s request for additional information, our review confirms that the solicitation has adequately defined its requirements and provided sufficient information to offerors.  Within the solicitation materials provided to all offerors, is an \u201cSRD gap analysis\u201d that identifies --by number description--each relevant SRD \nrequirement, and then provides an assessment of whether the BC3 software as it currently exists satisfies the requirement (completely or partially) or does not satisfy  the \nrequirement.

Comments  \nat 41-42.  Notwithstanding the protester\u2019s dissatisfaction, we find nothing objectionable \nwith the Air Force\u2019s assessment that the information provided in the solicitation --\napparently all that exists --combined with the offerors\u2019 business judgment, is suff icient for  Page 11 B-423294  offerors to intelligently prepare and assess the cost of their own strategy to meet the \nagency\u2019s needs here.

Agency Report (AR), Exh. 2, RFP at 9- 10, 113;1 Contracting \nOfficer Statement (COS) at 1.   \n \nThe solicitation sought proposals to provide nuclear submarine maintenance support services for  the Submarine Maintenance Engineering, Planning and Procurement \n(SUBMEPP)  activity , which is an independent field activity organized under the \nNAVSEA Command.  RFP at 9.  SUBMEPP\u2019s mission is to keep assigned Naval ships and submersibles safe, reliable, and affordable though the use of its engineered life \ncycle maintenance and modernization products and services.  Id .  The solicitation \nsought support services to SUBMEPP in the areas of administration, program \nmanagement, and engineering and logistics programs associated with life cycle \nmaintenance, modernization, and modification of Naval ships, unique platforms, new \nconstruction units, and support facilities.  Id . at 10.  \n The solicitation contemplated the issuance of a single,  cost-plus-fixed -fee and cost -\nreimbursable task order with a 1- year base period and four 1- year option periods.  RFP \nat 5-6, 113; COS at 3.  Award was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis , \nconsidering the following factors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) cost.  \nRFP at 114.  The technical factor was more important than past performance, and the two non- cost factors, when combined, were significantly more important than the cost \nfactor .  Id.  The technical factor comprised three subfactors:  (a) technical approach; \n(b) management approach; and (c) personnel approach.  Id.   The solicitation \nestablished that technical approach was the most important subfactor within the technical factor, with management approach and personnel approach of equal importance.  Id.  For the technical factor, and each of the subfactors, the agency would \nassign proposals an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id .         at 114- 115.   \n As relevant here, f or the personnel approach subfactor, the solicitation outlined that the \nagency would evaluate:  (1) a staffing plan; and (2) key personnel.  In this regard, the \nsolicitation instructed offerors to submit (1) a staffing plan and labor matrix that identified \nall non- key personnel and key personnel; and (2) resumes demonstrating specific \nindividual qual ifications for each of the nine positions the solicitation identified as key \npersonnel.

In this \nregard, resumes for key personnel were to be submitted in accordance with the format and instructions in RFP attachment 6.2 to include the \u201cemployee name, number of years of professional experience, current position\/title\/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience. \u201d  RFP \nattach. 6.2 at 6.  RFP attachment 6.2 also included the following note:   \u201cResumes are \nnot required for N on-K ey Personnel.  Resumes submitted for N on-K ey Personnel, apart \nfrom that of the [senior technical representative], will not be evaluated.\u201d  Id.   \n For past performance, the agency would assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of performance of submitted references.  RFP at 115.  For each past performance \nreference, the agency would first assign a rating of very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant or not relevant.  Id.  The agency would then assess the overall quality of the \nrecord of past performance and assign a performance confidence rating of substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral confidence, limited confidence or no confidence.  Id.  at 115-116.  As relevant here, the solicitation explained that the agency \nwould evaluate \u201call past performance information collected and determine the quality of the Offeror\u2019s performance, general trends, and usefulness of the information and \nincorporate these into the assignment of a performance confidence  assessment  rating.\u201d  \nId.  More relevant past performance would \u201chave more influence on the past \nperformance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance.\u201d  Id. \nat 116. \n The task order would be issued to the responsible offeror whose proposal \n\u201cdemonstrates the best value to the G overnment based on the evaluation factors.\u201d  Id. \nat 112- 113.  The solicitation explained that a tradeoff analysis m ight be used when it \nwas in the best interest of the government, and if one offeror had a better technical \ncapability and a higher total evaluated cost, the agency would \u201cdecide whether the \ndifference in technical capability [was]  worth the difference in price.\u201d  Id. at 11 4. \n \nThe Navy received three proposals, including proposals from Patrona and KMS.

The evaluators assigned Patrona\u2019s \nproposal a single strength under the technical approach subfactor, and no weaknesses, \nsignificant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 16.  No other \nstrengths were identified in Patrona\u2019s proposal.  Id.   The evaluators assigned KMS\u2019s \nproposal two strengths under the technical approach subfactor and a single strength under the management approach subfactor, with no identified weaknesses, significant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  Id.  at 3. \n The evaluators presented a source selection recommendation document  to the source \nselection authority (SSA) that pr ovided the evaluators\u2019 analysis and recommended \nissuing the task order to KMS.  AR, Exh. 5, Source Selection Recommendation Document (SSRD) at 8.  After reviewing this recommendation and all findings of the evaluators, the SSA determined that award to KMS represented the best overall value.  COS at 18; AR, Exh. 6, SSDD at 7 -8.  Specifically,  the SSA determined that , after taking \ninto consideration the relative importance of the technical approach and management approach subfactors, KMS\u2019s proposal was superior to Patrona\u2019s under the technical factor.  Id. at 7.  In addition, the SSA determined that KMS\u2019s record of past performance \nwas superior to Patrona\u2019s.  Id.  In sum, the SSA concluded that the technical superiority \nrepresented by KMS\u2019s  proposal was worth the cost premium as compared to Patrona\u2019s  \nlower -cost, lower -rated proposal.  Id. at 8.  As a result, the Navy determined that the \nproposal submitted by KMS represented the best value to the government.  Id. \n On December 31, the Navy issued the task order to KMS.  COS at 18.  After Patrona requested and received a debriefing,  it filed this protest.\n2 \n DISCUSSION \n \nThe protester challenges the Navy\u2019s evaluation of Patrona\u2019s proposal under the past \nperformance and technical factor s, including challenges under the technical approach, \nmanagement approach,  and personnel approach subfactors.

Patrona also argues that its proposal would have earned the highest possible rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d under this subfactor, and a higher rating in the technical factor overall, had the Navy given Patrona\u2019s proposal proper credit.  Protest at 8 -9.  The agency disagrees, defending its evaluation of \nPatrona\u2019s technical approach as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  MOL   \nat 3-8. \n Under the technical approach subfactor, the RFP required offerors to respond to four sample problems, each of which required offerors to address various scenarios that implicate specific tasks identified in the solicitation\u2019s PWS and SOW .  COS at 2; RFP \nat 104-105.  The Navy would then evaluate the extent to which the offerors\u2019 responses \nto the four sample problems \u201cdemonstrates specific understanding, capability, and experience to successfully perform the requirements, and the soundness of the proposed tec hnical approach.\u201d  RFP at 114.   \n Patrona argues  that the Navy should have awarded Patrona additional strengths for \nnumerous aspects of the firm\u2019s  responses to these four sample problems.  In this \nregard, Patrona argues that its responses \u201crepeatedly went above and beyond specified performance requirements,\u201d which the Navy failed to recognize.   Protest at 8.   Patrona \ncites various  proposal  attributes that warranted recognition as strengths by the agency \nbut were instead \u201cimproperly discounted.\u201d  Id.  at 8-9.

AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 3- 5.  The Navy \nalso argues that the protester made no attempt in its protest pleadings to establish that the claimed strengths exceed specific solicitation requirements or otherwise meet the \nsolicitation\u2019s definition of a strength.\n3   MOL at 4.  In this regard, the Navy asserts  that \nPatrona\u2019s protest allegations instead rely on \u201cgeneralized and conclusory statements \nabout its claimed strengths,\u201d without any explanation for how these proposal features \nexceed requirements or would otherwise be entitled to a strength under the soli citation.  \nId. \n  \nOur Office has explained that an agency\u2019s judgment that proposal  features did not \nexceed the requirements of the solicitation--and thus did not warrant the assessment of \nunique strengths --is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion and one that we will not \ndisturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the ev aluation was \nunreasonable.

Further , an agency\u2019s contemporaneous evaluation record is not required to prove a \nnegative or document all \u201cdeterminations of adequacy\u201d ( i.e., why a proposal did not \nreceive a strength or weakness).  See, e.g., Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al., \nNov. 13, 2020, 2021 CPD \u00b6 3 at 8.  When a protester raises a challenge regarding why a proposal was not assigned a strength or weakness, we review whether the agency\u2019s explanation or documentation--contemporaneous or otherwise--demonstrates that the \nevaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  Id . at 7 -8. \n \nBased on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Patrona\u2019s proposal  under this subfactor .  While  the protester repeatedly expresses \ndisagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment , Patrona does not demonstrate how its \nresponses to these four sample problems  exceeded solicitation requirements or  \nwarranted additional strengths or significant strengths.   \n \nFor example,  sample problem No. 1 required offerors to describe the planning, \ndevelopment, sustainment and execution tasks necessary to return a submarine to the fleet on a limited timeline, and the solicitation  identified various  specific  PWS\/SOW \ntasks applicable to such a scenario.  RFP at 104.  The protester  asserts that the agency \nunreasonably failed to proper ly credit Patrona\u2019s  response to sample problem N o.1 and \ncites Patrona\u2019s  reference to \u201cTable 5\u201d in its proposal as evidence of \u201cPatrona\u2019s expertise \nand knowledge\u201d of maintenance methodology for various submarine systems.

The agency responds that Patrona\u2019s response to sample \nproblem No.1 \u201cdemonstrated that it understood the current SUBMEPP process it \ncurrently executes\u201d but \u201cprovided no additional benefits other than what the SSEB \nconsidered the minimum required to be successful.\u201d  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 3.  In this regar d, the agency notes  that Patrona\u2019s response \u201clacked \ndetail\u201d and \u201cwas written in a way that assumed the evaluation team knew the processes in which Patrona operated,\u201d which  relied on the evaluators \u201cto fill in many blanks to fully \nunderstand Patrona\u2019s responses.\u201d  Id .   \n Similarly, Patrona argues that its responses to sample problems N os. 2 and 3 identified \n\u201cmultiple additional resources\u201d that \u201cmitigate quality risk and encapsulate expertise Patrona has developed by supporting SUBMEPP since 2014.\u201d\n5  Protest at 9.  Patrona \nasserts that the agency did not \u201cconsider [] the substantial significance of these \nadditional documents.\u201d  Id.   Patrona also contends that it should have been awarded a \nstrength for the \u201crisk mitigation process\u201d detailed in its response to sample problem \nNo. 4.6  Id.  In support of this point , Patrona explains that under the incumbent contact it \nhas developed a virtual screening process for planned maintenance system service \nrequests, requiring independent screening of these requests by a second technician--a feature that adds \u201csignificant val ue for SUBMEPP.\u201d  Id .  The agency responds that the \nquality control resources Patrona references under sample problems Nos. 2 and 3, are \n\u201cexpected of any contractor that performed [the SOW  tasks associated with sample \nproblems Nos. 2 and 3].\u201d\n7  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 4.  As for Patrona\u2019s \n \n4 By Patrona\u2019s own account,  table 5 simply \u201c identifies the processes and related \nproducts that address maintenance and modernization through submarine service life.\u201d  See AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona Technical Approach Proposal at 10.  \n5 Sample problem N o. 2 identified specific applicable PWS\/SOW sections and \nrequested the offeror\u2019s approach to ordering and completing three tasks involving a \nneglected safety feature, a new maintenance documentation requirement, and a response to set of ships failure data that was  transferred to the contractor in advance of \na scheduled maintenance event.  RFP at 104.  Sample problem N o. 3 also identified \nspecific PWS\/SOW tasks and requested, among other things, an equipment maintenance plan suitable for input into the Navy\u2019s planned maintenance system information system  (PMSMIS).  Id. at 104- 105.   \n6 Sample problem N o. 4 identified PWS\/SOW task 4.7 and requested the offeror to \nprovide submarine type commander (TYCOM) screening comments and TYCOM recommendations suitable for input into the PMSMIS database for a planned maintenance system service request.  RFP at 105.  \n7 Patrona also contends that the Navy should have assigned multiple strengths, and not \njust a single strength, for Patrona\u2019s \u201cinternal process guides and quality control checklists\u201d because these guides and checklists were \u201capplicable to multiple S ample \n(continued...)

As such, the agency argues the risk mitigation \nprocess did not warrant the assessment of a strength.   MOL at 7 -8. \n Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy\u2019s evaluation. In this regard, t he protester has not demonstrated that its responses to the sample \nproblems exceed solicitation requirements or that the agency unreasonably evaluated these aspects of Patrona\u2019s proposal.  Although Patrona may consider aspects of its technical approach to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis on which to sustain the protest. STG, Inc ., supra at 7. \n In addition, t hroughout its protest under this subfactor, Patrona argues that its proposal \nwas \u201cinformed by its experience performing the very same requirements\u201d sought  here \nand that its proposal included \u201cmeticulous detail that demonstrated its superior knowledge of the requirements, processes, and procedures\u201d required by the solicitation.  See Protest at 8- 9.  Although the protester denies that it is demanding credit for its \nincumbent experience, see Comments at 10- 11, we find that the protester\u2019s arguments, \nat their core, amount to a request that our Office substitute the agency\u2019s  judgment for \nthe protester \u2019s on the basis that Patrona\u2019s experience performing the incumbent \ncontract puts the firm in a  better position to determine whether its proposal exceeded \nthe solicitation\u2019s requirements.  We decline to do so.  See Systems Implementers, Inc.; Transcend Tech. Sys., LLC , B-418963.5 et al., June 1, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 138 at 16 \n(denying contention that prot ester\u2019s proposal merited assessment of multiple additional \nstrengths for various aspects of protester\u2019s experience where protester\u2019s view of its experience expressed nothing more than its disagreement with the evaluators\u2019 subjective judgments).  These allegations are denied.  \n \nManagement Approach Subfactor  \n Patrona next challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation under the management approach subfactor.  Protest at 10- 11.  Patrona makes two principal arguments.  First, the \nprotester  argues that its \u201cproven management approach,\u201d and the features and benefits \n \nProblems.\u201d  Protest at 9.  T he agency responds  that it reasonably assigned Patrona\u2019s \nproposal a single strength based on Patrona\u2019s internal process guides and quality \ncontrol checklists, in the aggregate, since they were applicable to all four sample problems .  AR, Exh. 10,  Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 4.  Based on our review of the \nrecord, we agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require the assignment of multiple  individual strengths for  repeat  occurrences of a positive aspect within an \nofferor\u2019s  response to each sample problem.  We thus deny this protest allegation.   Page 9    B-423282   it outlined in table 16 of its proposal, \u201cwarranted a higher rating than A cceptable.\u201d8  Id. \nat 11; Comments at 15.  Second, Patrona contends that the positive ratings it received \non its 2023 interim Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) \nassessment , reflecting its performance on the incumbent contract, should have \ntranslated to a rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d under the management approach subfactor.  \nProtest at 11.  In this regard, Patrona states that its management team and proposal \napproach mirror the team and approach it is using under the current incumbent contract \nwhere it has been recognized with several positive CPARS assessments.9  Id.   \n \nBased on our review of the record, we find no basis to sustain Patrona\u2019s protest.  First, \nalthough Patrona cites to the features and benefits included in table 16 of its proposal to \nargue for a higher rating under this subfactor, Patrona does not allege that the agency failed to consider these features.  Protest at 9- 10.  Nor does Patrona articulate how \nthese proposal features merit the assignment of a strength or a higher adjectival rating under this subfactor.  See id .  Instead, Patrona\u2019s protest simply r e-states the content of \nits proposal and notes its disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation conclusion, which \nas discussed above, does not provide a basis to sustain a protest.   See Perspecta \nEng\u2019g, Inc ., B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 314 at 7.  \n Additionally, the agency explains that the evaluators considered the information noted in \ntable 16 of Patrona\u2019s proposal, such as  the firm\u2019s  \u201cexperienced incumbent management \nteam\u201d and proposal to  \u201cmaintain an effective communication plan.\u201d  See AR, Exh. 10, \nDecl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5 -6.  The agency concluded that these features and \nothers in Patrona\u2019s proposal \u201csquarely met the requirements\u201d and \u201caligned with standard \nbusiness practices,\u201d but did not reflect an exceptional approach or provide anticipated \nvalue to the Navy that exceeded solicitation requirements.  Id.  On this record, we see \nno basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation judgment.\n10   \n \n8 For the management approach subfactor, the solicitation instructed offerors to \ndescribe their \u201coverall management approach including details about processes, tools, \nand other unique characteristics that demonstrate the ability to successfully manage this effort.\u201d  RFP at 105.  In turn, the agency would \u201cevaluate the extent to which the \nproposal demonstrates an effective management organization with the capability, processes, and tools to successfully perform the requirements and ensure the highest quality deliverables, communication, cost management, risk management, and subcontractor management.\u201d  Id. at 114.  The agency\u2019s evaluators assigned Patrona\u2019s \nmanagement approach proposal a rating of \u201cacceptable,\u201d noting that Patrona\u2019s management approach \u201cmeets requirements and indicated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.\u201d  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.   \n \n9 Patrona notes that it received positive CPARS assessments spanning the time period \nbetween December 2020 and December 2023.  Comments  at 13.  \n10 Patrona further argues that the agency\u2019s documentation under this subfactor is \n\u201cscant ,\u201d and the protest should accordingly be sustained.  Protest at 11.  We disagree.  \nAlthough we note that the contemporaneous  evaluation record rests on conclusory \n(continued...)   Page 10    B-423282    \nFinally, we see no basis to find that the agency was required to align its evaluation findings under the management approach subfactor with Patrona\u2019s prior CPARS ratings on the incumbent contract.  The solicitation\u2019s submission instructions for the management approach subfactor did not request past performance references, nor did the evaluation criteria apprise offerors that the agency would be assessing records of past performance when assessing proposals under the management approach \nsubfactor.  See  RFP at 105, 114.  \n The protester essentially urges that the agency\u2019s understanding of Patrona\u2019s performance on the incumbent contract should have supplemented the Navy\u2019s evaluation of the text of Patrona\u2019s management approach proposal.  We disagree.  We see no requirement in the evaluation criteria that would obligate the agency to consider \nan offeror\u2019s prior incumbent performance--as opposed to the various descriptions of the offeror\u2019s management approach the agency requested, and committed to evaluate, under this subfactor.   Additionally, while our decisions have concluded that, in some \ncases, past performance information in the agency\u2019s possession cannot be ignored, we have specifically declined to extend that principle to an agency\u2019s evaluation of technical proposals.  See Enterprise Sols. Realized, Inc. ; Unissant, Inc ., B-409642, B -409642.2, \nJune 23, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 201 at 9.  As such, we find no merit to Patrona\u2019s arguments  \nhere and accordingly deny these protest grounds.  \n \nPersonnel Approach Subfactor  \n The protester next argues that the agency failed to evaluate Patrona\u2019s staffing plan and \nkey personnel in accordance with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria, and that had the Navy done so, the agency would have assigned Patrona\u2019s proposal  several strengths \nand significant strengths --and the highest possible adjectival rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d  \n \nstatements  about Patrona\u2019s management approach proposal , see AR, Exh.  4, SSEB \nReport  at 21, as noted above, t he agency submitted,  with the agency report, a \ndeclaration from the SSEB chairperson providing  additional details  supporting the \nevaluators\u2019 conclusions .  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6.  While we \naccord greater weight to contemporaneous materials as opposed to judgments made in response to protest contentions, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed \nrationale for contemporaneous c onclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded \ndetails, will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection \ndecisions --so long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the \ncontemporaneous record.  Science & Tech. Corp., B -420216, Jan. 3, 2022, 2022 CPD \n\u00b6 1 at 8 n.6.  Here, we find that the agency\u2019s post -protest statement  fills in previously \nunrecorded details and provides credible explanations that are consistent with the \ncontemporaneous record.   See, e.g. , AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6 \n(explaining that the evaluators considered the specific features of Patrona\u2019s management approach proposal but concluded that these features \u201cdid not provide  \nanticipated value to the Navy beyond the requirements, such as proposing improvements to process efficiency or quality control\u201d) .    Page 11    B-423282   under the personnel approach subfactor.  Protest at 12- 13.  In this regard, Patrona \nmakes two general allegations.  First, Patrona argues that the agency failed to consider \nqualifications information for non- key personnel that Patrona included in its staff ing plan.  \nId.  Second, Patrona contends that the Navy did not give Patrona sufficient credit for the \nqualifications of the key personnel it proposed.  Id.   The agency responds that the \nsolicitation did not obligate or permit the agency to evaluate the qualification information Patrona elected to include for its proposed non- key personnel.  MOL at 10- 15.  In \naddition, the Navy argues that its evaluation of Patrona\u2019s staffing plan and key personnel was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  Id.   For the reasons \nexplained below, we deny this protest ground.  \n By way of background, f or the staffing plan submission, offerors were required to use \nthe format provided in RFP attachment 6.1.  RFP at 105;  AR, Exh. 2,  RFP attach. 6.1, \nStaffing P lan.  In this regard, offerors were to provide a \u201ccomplete labor matrix\u201d that \n\u201cdemonstrates an appropriate mix of personnel to accomplish all tasks in the PWS\/SOW.\u201d  RFP attach. 6.2 at 1.  Offerors were instructed to use the required format \nto align the proposed mix of personnel with the labor hours identified in RFP section B and RFP attachment 6.2.  RFP at 105; RFP attach. 6.2 at  1.  As relevant here, the \nrequired format in RFP attachment 6.1 was a Microsoft excel spreadsheet that included columns for the names of proposed personnel, whether the individual is key or non- key, \nthe PWS\/SOW task area the individual would support, the i ndividual\u2019s proposed labor \nhours, and a final column labeled \u201cnotes.\u201d  RFP attach. 6.1.  Finally, the solicitation instructed that when filling out the staffing plan spreadsheet, offerors should \u201cuse \u2018TBD\u2019 [to be determined]  for non- key positions that do not have identified personnel.\u201d  RFP    \nat 105.   \n    Non-Key Personnel  \n The protester argues that the solicitation required the agency to assess the individual qualifications and experience information for the non- key personnel identified in \nPatrona\u2019s  staffing plan.  Protest at 12- 13.  Patrona asserts that it \u201cincluded by name \nnearly 100 non- key incumbent personnel\u201d and included in the \u201cnotes\u201d column in the \nstaffing plan a \u201cvast amount of information\u201d for its incumbent non- key personnel \nconcerning thei r qualifications, certifications, and years of experience.  Id. at 13.  The \nprotester contends that had the agency evaluated the qualifications of its non- key \npersonnel, Patrona would have received strengths and a \u201chigher rating due to the qualified and experienced individuals \u201d included in its staffing plan.  Id. at 12- 13. \n The Navy disagrees, arguing that the solicitation did not contemplate the assessment of individual qualifications for  non-key personnel.  MOL at 10- 13.  The Navy contends that \nPatrona\u2019s interpretation \u201cread[s] an unstated evaluation requirement \u201d into the solicitation \nand is contradicted by the solicitation\u2019s restriction barring the agency from considering \nnon-key personnel resume information.  Id. at 11- 12.  The Navy notes that the \nsolicitation did not request qualifications information for non- key personnel, and the \nrequired format for the staffing plan in RFP attachment 6.1 did not include a column for  \nthe qualifications for non- key personnel.  Id.  at 11.  Instead, as noted above, the  Page 12    B-423282   offeror\u2019s staffing plan was to include information on whether the employee was key or \nnon-key, the labor category, labor hours proposed, and the PWS\/SOW task the \nemployee would support.  Id. (citing RFP, attach. 6.1).  The solicitation requested this \ninformation so the Navy could evaluate the extent to which the offerors\u2019 staffing plan addressed  the labor hours identified in RFP section B and confirm that the proposed \npersonnel would perform all aspects of the PWS\/SOW.  Id. (citing RFP at  114).   \n The Navy maintains that Patrona improperly used the \u201cnotes\u201d column of the required labor mix  to insert resume qualifications information for non- key personnel --which the \nsolicitation expressly prohibited the agency from considering.  See MOL  at 11- 12 (citing \nRFP attach. 6.2 at 6).  The protester responds that \u201c [t]he fact that the S olicitation stated \nthat the A gency would not evaluate resumes for non- key personnel does not mean that \nthe Agency could not consider their qualifications.\u201d  Comments  at 19.   \n When a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of  its provisions.  MSK TriTech Group, LLC , B-421814, Oct. 3, 2023, 2023 \nCPD \u00b6 235 at 6.

HumanTouch, LLC , B-419880 et al., Aug. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 283 at 6. \nHere, we find that the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, and the protester\u2019s is not.   \n At the outset,  we note that the relevant  solicitation criterion--requiring the agency to  \nevaluate the extent to which the \u201cstaffing plan and key personnel [] are qualified, experienced, and suitable for performing the requirements,\u201d see RFP at 114-- appear s to \nsuggest the agency was required to evaluate the individual qualifications of all non- key \npersonnel identified in an offeror\u2019s staffing plan, as urged by the protester.  This reading, \nhowever, fails to give effect to the solicitation language as a whole . \n First, we disagree that the solicitation obligated the agency to evaluate the individual qualifications of non- key personnel that Patrona elected to submit with its staffing plan.  \nThe RFP instructed that offerors \u201cshall\u201d provide a staffing plan using the format provided in attachment 6.1, staffing plan, and in accordance with attachment 6.2, personnel qualifications.  RFP at 105.  As noted above, this required format did not include a column requesting the input of any qualifications information for non- key personnel.  \nSee id .  Moreover, the solicitation included a clear statement indicating that \u201c[r]esumes \nsubmitted for N on-Key Personnel [] will not be evaluated.\u201d   RFP attach. 6.2 at 6.   \n Reading the solicitation as a whole to give effect to all provisions, it is clear that the staffing plan portion of the personnel approach evaluation was intended to assess offerors\u2019 proposed labor mix es for labor category mapping purposes, to ensure the \nstaffing plan was aligned with section B, and to confirm that offerors could meet all requirements in the PWS\/SOW.  See RFP at 105- 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 1- 3.  \nThis portion of the evaluation is in contrast with the key personnel evaluation, which, as noted above, involved a request for resumes  for the purpose of  evaluating the specific \nqualifications of nine identified key personnel .  RFP at 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 3- 6.   Page 13    B-423282   Although the sentence in the evaluation criteria, as noted above,  is not a model of \nclarity, it is clear from the solicitation as a whole that  the agency did not intend to \nrequest, or evaluate, individual qualifications information for the many non- key \npersonnel (as opposed to the nine identified key personnel) an offeror could include in \nits staffing plan.  \n Moreover , we find that the vast majority of information Patrona included in the notes \ncolumn for its identified non- key personnel to be, in all practical effect, resume \ninformation.\n11  Faulting the agency for not evaluating individual qualifications information \nfor non- personnel that Patrona inserted into the notes column in the staffing plan would \nrender extraneous and absurd the solicitation\u2019s prohibition on evaluating resumes for \nnon-key personnel.  Cf. HumanTouch, LLC , supra at 6; CACI, Inc. --Fed., B-422774, \nB-422774.2, Oct. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 257.  We thus decline to adopt any \ninterpretation that eschews the plain intent of the solicitation to evaluate resume qualifications information for the nine identified key personnel positions only.\n12  As a \nresult, we see no basis to sustain Patrona\u2019s protest based on the argument that the Navy was obligated to assign strengths or significant strengths to Patrona\u2019s proposal because of alleged superior qualifications of Patrona\u2019s non- key personnel.\n13   \n \n11 For example, the notes column for non- key personnel in Patrona\u2019s staffing plan \nincluded such information as the individual\u2019s number of years of professional experience, current position, educational history, professional certifications, and years of experience on the SUBMEPP contract, among other highlighted qualifications, see AR, Exh. 7.2, Patrona Staffing Plan Proposal, which is closely aligned with the information the solicitation requested to be included in resumes for key personnel.  See RFP attach. 6.2 at 6 (requesting \u201c number of years of professional experience, current \nposition\/title\/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience\u201d ). \n12 To the extent that the protester\u2019s arguments can be read as a challenge to the lack of \nclarity in the solicitation, we note any ambiguity here was apparent from the face of the \nsolicitation.  As such, the ambiguity was patent, and any post -award challenge to these  \nsolicitation terms would be untimely.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1).  \n13 We note that the unclear solicitation language at issue here is nearly identical to the \nsolicitation language in CACI, Inc. --Fed. , supra, where a protester challenged the \nNavy\u2019s failure to evaluate the qualifications of the awardee\u2019s non- key personnel, which \nthe protester argued would have revealed deficiencies in the awardee\u2019s proposal.  Id .  \nOur Office found the protester\u2019s argument to be unreasonable given \u201clanguage in the solicitation that allowed offerors to use unidentified \u2018TBD\u2019 employees for non- key \npersonnel positions.\u201d  Id . at 11.  As our Office explained, because offerors could \npropose \u201cTBD\u201d for non- key personnel, interpretating the solicitation to require the \nagency to evaluate all non- key personnel qualifications to determine compliance with \nminimum qualifications would \u201ccreate an absurd situation where the solicitation permitted offerors to submit proposals that would be impossible for the agency to evaluate in accordance with the solicitation.\u201d  Id.    \n(continued...)   Page 14    B-423282    \n   Key Personnel  \n The protester also argues that the Navy should have assigned Patrona a strength \nbecause all nine of Patrona\u2019s key personnel met  or exceeded solicitation requirements , \nincluding meeting or exceeding many of the \u201cdesired qualifications\u201d identified in the solicitation .  Protest at  13; Comments at 21- 27.  In particular, the protester asserts that \nthe Navy should have assigned a strength for Patrona\u2019s proposed senior technical representative, who Patrona contends exceeds the solicitation\u2019s \u201cdesired experience and education criteria\u201d and has over 25 years of experience leading submarine maintenance technical teams for SUBMEPP.  Protest at  13 (citing AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona \nTechnical Proposal at 34); Comments at 21- 27.   \n The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably assessed the qualifications represented by Patrona\u2019s proposed key personnel .  MOL at 14.  The evaluators noted \nthat Patrona\u2019s proposed key personnel were \u201csuited to perform the requirements, inclusive of the S enior Technical Representative, \u201d and determined that \u201cthe capabilities \nand qualifications of the K ey Personnel are adequate to perform the tasking for which \nthey are proposed.\u201d   AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.  In addition, the Navy included a \ndeclaration from the SSEB chairperson stating that \u201c[t]he SSEB reviewed the key personnel in total for each offeror and found that while some of Patrona\u2019s key personnel met or exceeded some of the desired qualifications, many other s of Patrona\u2019s key \npersonnel did not meet or exceed the desired qualifications.\u201d   AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of \nSSEB Chairperson at 7.   As an example, the agency notes that one of the individuals \nproposed for a key personnel position did not have the minimum  desired 10 years of \nsupervisory experience, and another did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree in an engineering discipline.  Id.  The Navy explai ns that when deciding whether to assess strengths  \nunder this subfactor , the evaluators  assessed the \u201csum total of all personnel\u201d in \nPatrona\u2019s proposal  and determined that the proposed key personnel , in the aggregate,  \n\u201cadequately met the requirements,\u201d even if each key personnel  proposed \u201cdid not meet \nor exceed all desired qualifications .\u201d  Id.   \n \nIn response to the Navy\u2019s urging that we adopt a similar position here, Patrona contends that, although the instant solicitation has a comparable provision allowing offerors to submit \u201cTBD\u201d for non -key personnel, see RFP at  105, the same absurd result \nidentified in CACI, Inc. --Fed would not arise.  See Comments at  20.  In this regard, \nPatrona does not argue that the solicitation required the agency to disqualify the awardee based on deficiencies in the awardee\u2019s non- key personnel staffing plan but \ninstead argues that the agency was required to evaluate t he qualifications of the non-\nkey personnel Patrona chose to identify in its staffing plan.   See id.  Although we \nacknowledge this distinction, we ultimately conclude that it produces no meaningful difference to the outcome here.  In this regard, reading the solicitation language as a whole and giving effect to all provisions --including the solicitation\u2019s  prohibition on \nevaluating resumes for non- key personnel --we agree with the Navy that the solicitation \nhere did not require the agency to assess the qualifications of the non- key personnel \nthat Patrona elected to include in its staffing plan proposal.    Page 15    B-423282    \nOn this record, we can find no basis to sustain Patrona\u2019s protest.   While the protester \nmay believe it is entitled to a strength or  strengths because several of its proposed key \npersonnel met or exceeded certain desired qualifications , the record shows that the \nagency was aware of both the benefits  and shortcomings  presented by  Patrona\u2019s key \npersonnel  proposal  and reasonably  determined that Patrona\u2019s key personnel, overall,  \ndid not merit a strength.  Although the protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s judgment, the protester has not shown that it was unreasonable for the agency to assess the overall qualifications represented by Patrona\u2019s  key personnel proposal  when deciding \nwhether to assign strengths.  See Assessment & Training Sols. Consulting Corp.,        \nB-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 177 at 15- 16 (finding protester \nwas not entitled to additional strengths for meeting desired qualifications, where the \nagency was aware of the benefits of the protester\u2019s proposal and the protester did not show that the agency\u2019s assignment of strengths was unreasonable) .  Accordingly, these \nallegations are denied.  \n Past Performance  Next, Patrona raises various challenges to the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  \nPatrona argues that the agency unreasonably failed to consider the relevant past performance of Patrona\u2019s subcontractor on the incumbent project, ICI Services Corporation (ICI).  Patrona also argues that the Navy gave outsized weight to several \nnegative performance issues that Patrona experienced on the incumbent contract.  In addition, Patrona contends that the agency unreasonably determined that one of Patrona\u2019s  past per formance references was only \u201csomewhat relevant.\u201d  The protester \ncontends that had the Navy not made these errors, Patrona would have been assigned the highest rating of \u201csubstantial confidence\u201d instead of the second highest rating of \u201csatisfactory confidence. \u201d\n14  Protest at 13- 17; Comments at 29- 30. \n The Navy responds that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  The agency argues that it  acted within its discretion to not double count the \nsame record of past performance, which reflected the two entities\u2019  (Patrona and ICI)  \nperformance on the incumbent contract.  The Navy also argues that it reasonably considered Patrona\u2019s performance issues on the incumbent contract, which included staffing shortfalls and alleged falsified timesheets.  Finally, the Navy argues that the evaluators analyzed Patrona\u2019s \u201creference N o. 2\u201d and reasonably determined that it was \nonly somewhat relevant when compared to the scope of this solicitation.  MOL at 15- 18; \nSupp. MOL at  4-6. \n \n14 Patrona also argued initially that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate the past \nperformance proposal submitted by KMS.  Protest at 17.  After the agency argued that its evaluation of KMS\u2019s past performance was reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation, the protester failed to address this argument in comments.  See  generally \nComments.  Accordingly, we dismiss th is allegation as abandoned and do not consider \nit further.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3(i)(3); Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr. 12, 2023, 2023 \nCPD \u00b6 92 at 4 n.3.   Page 16    B-423282    \nAt the outset, we note that an agency\u2019s evaluation of past performance, including its  consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of an offeror\u2019s performance  history, is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency\u2019s  \nassessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria.  \nCrowderGulf, LLC et al. , B-418693.9 et al., Mar. 25, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 90 at 20; \nMetropolitan Interpreters & Translators, Inc ., B-415080.7, B -415080.8, May 14, 2019,  \n2019 CPD \u00b6 181 at 10.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment does  not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  CrowderGulf, supra at 20.  \nAdditionally, there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  ENGlobal Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. , B-419612, B -419612.2, May 14, 2021, \n2021 CPD \u00b6 214 at 4- 5. \n As discussed below, the record here demonstrates that the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria.   \n First, we find that the Navy reasonably considered the reference Patrona submitted for its subcontractor, ICI, for work ICI performed with Patrona on the incumbent contract.  The record shows that the Navy considered both Patrona\u2019s and ICI\u2019s performance on \nthe incumbent contract to be \u201crecent\u201d and \u201cvery relevant,\u201d since the efforts on the incumbent contract \u201cinvolve[] essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and \ncomplexities this solicitation requires.\u201d  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 26.  The evaluat ors \nalso noted that the reference that Patrona submitted for ICI was the same reference that Patrona submitted for itself as the prime contractor on the incumbent contract.  Id.  The \nevaluators considered this reference, but ultimately concluded that considering this record twice would \u201cnot add any additional value to the overall past performance assessment[.]\u201d  Id.  \n The protester argues that the Navy was obligated to give Patrona double credit  for this \nreference, but the solicitation here gave no indication that the agency was required to assign a single past performance reference twice as much weight when the reference was submitted on behalf of both a prime contractor and its subcontractor.  Rather, since the R FP informed offerors that the agency intended to assess \u201cthe usefulness of the \ninformation\u201d when assigning the confidence rating, see RFP at 115, we see no iss ue \nwith the Navy\u2019s determination that considering the same reference twice would not add any significant value to the agency\u2019s past performance assessment or its confidence in Patrona\u2019s performance.   \n In addition, Patrona included in its own past performance proposal the following statement:  \u201cICI\u2019s contributions to the SUBMEPP contract are covered under the P rime \nContractor [Patrona] CPARS.\u201d  AR, Exh. 7.3, Patrona Past Performance Proposal at 8.  \nIn this regard, Patrona\u2019s proposal informed the agency that it considered this CPARS to \ncover the performance history of both entities on the incumbent contract.   On this \nrecord, we find no basis to fault the agency for exercising reasonable discretion to not \ndouble- count this reference--particularly when Patrona\u2019s own proposal informed the  Page 17    B-423282   Navy that Patrona considered ICI\u2019s contributions  to be \u201ccovered under\u201d the record of \npast performance that  Patrona submitted for the incumbent project.  See id.  \n \nSecond, we find that the Navy reasonably considered and weighed several negative performance issues, along with the positive ratings on Patrona\u2019s CPARS, for the incumbent project.  The record shows that the Navy considered Patrona\u2019s CPARS \nratings of \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csatisfactory\u201d on the incumbent contract, noting also that performance on the incumbent contract was considered \u201cvery relevant\u201d given the \u201cminimal differences between the existing contract and this solicitation.\u201d  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 23.  However, the Navy identified \u201ctwo major performance issues\u201d on \nthe incumbent contract --both of which, the agency indicated, \u201csignificantly decreases \nthe Government\u2019s confidence in Patrona being able to successful[ly] execute this \ncontract with minimal risk.\u201d  Id.   \n In this regard, the agency\u2019s evaluators explained that after a suspected discrepancy  \nreported on a voucher Patrona submitted for the incumbent contract , between the \nobserved work hours and the certified hours, the agency conducted an audit confirming that Patrona billed for hours that were not worked.  Id. at 23- 24.  The agency further \nexplained that Patrona amended the voucher and removed the inaccurately charged hours, but that this issue nevertheless raised \u201csignificant concern with the ability of Patrona to maintain accurate accounting of their work\u201d which \u201cincreases the risk of successful contract execution without the presence of fraud, waste or abuse.\u201d  Id. at 24.  \nAdditionally , the agency identified a persistent issue with \u201cPatrona\u2019s inability to maintain \nstaffing levels\u201d consistent with the staffing levels for positions identified in its fixed- price \ntasking.  Id.   In this regard, the evaluators noted that the Navy  endured \u201cperiods of \nunderstaffing while being billed for the entire [fixed- price] amount.\u201d  Id.   The evaluators \n\u201cacknowledged the efforts Patrona was taking to resolve the issue,\u201d but concluded that the \u201cinability of Patrona to adequately staff positions on the contract decreases the level of confidence that Patrona can successfully execute the task ing of this solicitation.\u201d  Id.  \n Patrona argues that \u201cthese incidents should not have negatively impacted Patrona\u2019s Past Performance rating, as Patrona took prompt action to rectify these isolated issues.\u201d  \nProtest at 16.  In this regard, Patrona argues that the Navy should have given greater weight to Patrona\u2019s explanations in its proposal concerning how it \u201cpromptly address ed \nand resolved\u201d those performance issues.  See id. at 15- 16.  Beyond Patrona\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Navy\u2019s evaluation judgment, however, Patrona has not provided our Office any basis to question the Navy\u2019s consideration of Patrona\u2019s performance \nissues on this \u201cvery relevant\u201d contract.\n 15   \n \n15 Because we find that the agency reasonably considered these two \u201cmajor \nperformance issues\u201d on Patrona\u2019s \u201cvery relevant\u201d incumbent project, AR, Exh. 4, SSEB \nReport  at 23, we see no basis to conclude that the agency would have raised Patrona\u2019s \npast performance rating beyond the second- highest rating of \u201csatisfactory confidence,\u201d \neven if the protester\u2019s other challenges to the past performance evaluation were to be sustained.

Patrona contends that the Navy improperly overlooked the similarities between \nthe two projects, arguing that the Navy ignored the many references to relevant sections of the SOW that Patrona included with this past performance reference.  Comments at 29-30.  The Navy argues in response that the solicitation required offerors to include \n\u201ca written explanation describing [] how the work was or is relevant to the work being proposed in this solicitation,\u201d see  RFP, attach. 6.3, but that Patrona only listed \u201ca series \nof SOW citations, without providing any context.\u201d  Supp. MOL at 3.  As a result, the Navy contends that it assessed the information Patrona provided and came to the reasonable conclusion that the pr oject was only \u201csomewhat relevant.\u201d  Id. at 6. \n We can find no basis to question the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  As our \nOffice has said repeatedly, an offeror is responsible for submitting a well -written \nproposal with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the procuring a gency.  See  FEDSYNC BEI, LLC,  B-417492, B -417492.2, July 23, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 303 at 10 (finding that  agency reasonably did not credit  a protester\u2019s past \nperformance reference that \u201clisted functional requirements of the PWS without any \nexplanati on of how the incumbent\u2019s performance of that requirement satisfied the RFP\u2019s \nrequirements.\u201d).  Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy\u2019s conclusions about the relevance of this project.   \n In sum, w e see no merit to the protester\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nPatrona\u2019s past performance; as a result, these allegations are denied.  \n Best-Value  Determination \n As a final matter, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s best -value determination  \nwas improper because it was based on a flawed evaluation.

Agency Report (AR), Exh. 2, RFP at 9- 10, 113;1 Contracting \nOfficer Statement (COS) at 1.   \n \nThe solicitation sought proposals to provide nuclear submarine maintenance support services for  the Submarine Maintenance Engineering, Planning and Procurement \n(SUBMEPP)  activity , which is an independent field activity organized under the \nNAVSEA Command.  RFP at 9.  SUBMEPP\u2019s mission is to keep assigned Naval ships and submersibles safe, reliable, and affordable though the use of its engineered life \ncycle maintenance and modernization products and services.  Id .  The solicitation \nsought support services to SUBMEPP in the areas of administration, program \nmanagement, and engineering and logistics programs associated with life cycle \nmaintenance, modernization, and modification of Naval ships, unique platforms, new \nconstruction units, and support facilities.

RFP \nat 5-6, 113; COS at 3.  Award was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis , \nconsidering the following factors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) cost.  \nRFP at 114.  The technical factor was more important than past performance, and the two non- cost factors, when combined, were significantly more important than the cost \nfactor .  Id.  The technical factor comprised three subfactors:  (a) technical approach; \n(b) management approach; and (c) personnel approach.  Id.   The solicitation \nestablished that technical approach was the most important subfactor within the technical factor, with management approach and personnel approach of equal importance.  Id.  For the technical factor, and each of the subfactors, the agency would \nassign proposals an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id .         at 114- 115.   \n As relevant here, f or the personnel approach subfactor, the solicitation outlined that the \nagency would evaluate:  (1) a staffing plan; and (2) key personnel.  In this regard, the \nsolicitation instructed offerors to submit (1) a staffing plan and labor matrix that identified \nall non- key personnel and key personnel; and (2) resumes demonstrating specific \nindividual qual ifications for each of the nine positions the solicitation identified as key \npersonnel.

Resumes submitted for N on-K ey Personnel, apart \nfrom that of the [senior technical representative], will not be evaluated.\u201d  Id.   \n For past performance, the agency would assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of performance of submitted references.  RFP at 115.  For each past performance \nreference, the agency would first assign a rating of very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant or not relevant.  Id.  The agency would then assess the overall quality of the \nrecord of past performance and assign a performance confidence rating of substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral confidence, limited confidence or no confidence.  Id.  at 115-116.  As relevant here, the solicitation explained that the agency \nwould evaluate \u201call past performance information collected and determine the quality of the Offeror\u2019s performance, general trends, and usefulness of the information and \nincorporate these into the assignment of a performance confidence  assessment  rating.\u201d  \nId.  More relevant past performance would \u201chave more influence on the past \nperformance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance.\u201d  Id. \nat 116. \n The task order would be issued to the responsible offeror whose proposal \n\u201cdemonstrates the best value to the G overnment based on the evaluation factors.\u201d  Id. \nat 112- 113.  The solicitation explained that a tradeoff analysis m ight be used when it \nwas in the best interest of the government, and if one offeror had a better technical \ncapability and a higher total evaluated cost, the agency would \u201cdecide whether the \ndifference in technical capability [was]  worth the difference in price.\u201d  Id. at 11 4. \n \nThe Navy received three proposals, including proposals from Patrona and KMS.

The agency\u2019s evaluators assessed the proposals of Patrona, the incumbent \ncontractor,  and KMS as follows:  \n \n \n \n KMS  Patrona  \nTechnical  Good  Acceptable  \n     Technical Approach  Outstanding  Good  \n     Management Approach  Good  Acceptable  \n     Personnel Approach  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nPast Performance  Substantial Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  \nTotal Evaluated Cost  $62,312,331  $57,729,578   Page 4    B-423282   AR, Exh. 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (S SEB) Report  at 3; AR, Exh. 6, Source \nSelection Decision Document (SSDD) at 4.  The evaluators assigned Patrona\u2019s \nproposal a single strength under the technical approach subfactor, and no weaknesses, \nsignificant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 16.  No other \nstrengths were identified in Patrona\u2019s proposal.  Id.   The evaluators assigned KMS\u2019s \nproposal two strengths under the technical approach subfactor and a single strength under the management approach subfactor, with no identified weaknesses, significant weaknesses , or deficiencies.  Id.  at 3. \n The evaluators presented a source selection recommendation document  to the source \nselection authority (SSA) that pr ovided the evaluators\u2019 analysis and recommended \nissuing the task order to KMS.  AR, Exh. 5, Source Selection Recommendation Document (SSRD) at 8.  After reviewing this recommendation and all findings of the evaluators, the SSA determined that award to KMS represented the best overall value.  COS at 18; AR, Exh. 6, SSDD at 7 -8.  Specifically,  the SSA determined that , after taking \ninto consideration the relative importance of the technical approach and management approach subfactors, KMS\u2019s proposal was superior to Patrona\u2019s under the technical factor.  Id. at 7.  In addition, the SSA determined that KMS\u2019s record of past performance \nwas superior to Patrona\u2019s.  Id.  In sum, the SSA concluded that the technical superiority \nrepresented by KMS\u2019s  proposal was worth the cost premium as compared to Patrona\u2019s  \nlower -cost, lower -rated proposal.  Id. at 8.  As a result, the Navy determined that the \nproposal submitted by KMS represented the best value to the government.  Id. \n On December 31, the Navy issued the task order to KMS.  COS at 18.  After Patrona requested and received a debriefing,  it filed this protest.\n2 \n DISCUSSION \n \nThe protester challenges the Navy\u2019s evaluation of Patrona\u2019s proposal under the past \nperformance and technical factor s, including challenges under the technical approach, \nmanagement approach,  and personnel approach subfactors.  Patrona asserts that , \nbecause of these evaluation errors, the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff was flawed.  We \nhave fully considered all of Patrona\u2019s arguments, and while we do not specifically \naddress every argument made, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain \nthe protest.   \n \nTechnical Factor Evaluation  \n Patrona raises numerous challenges to the evaluation of its proposal under the \nsolicitation\u2019s most important factor, technical.  Patrona contends that the agency \nunreasonably evaluated Patrona\u2019s technical proposal and failed to assess strengths for \n \n2 The value of the task order is $62 ,312,331 and is therefore within our jurisdiction to \nreview protests related to the issuance of orders exceeding $3 5 million under multiple-\naward IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.   10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B ).

The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 15.  The \nagency contends that the protester\u2019s arguments amount to disagreement with the judgment of agency evaluators and do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.  Id.  \n The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition, including the determination of  the relative merits of proposals, is primarily a matter within the contracting agency\u2019s  discretion, because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best  \nmethod of accommodating them.  URS Fed. Servs., Inc. , B-413333, Oct. 11, 2016,  \n2016 CPD \u00b6 286 at 6.  In reviewing protests of an agency\u2019s evaluation and source  selection decision in a task or delivery order competition, we do not reevaluate  proposals; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation  criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

Concepts, Inc. , B-421320, Mar. 20, 2023, 2023 \nCPD \u00b6 101 at 5.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without more, is insufficient to establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  STG, Inc ., B-405101.3 \net al., Jan. 12, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 48 at 7.  \n \nTechnical Approach Subfactor  \n The protester first contends that the Navy overlooked multiple strengths in Patrona\u2019s \nproposal under the technical approach subfactor.  Patrona also argues that its proposal would have earned the highest possible rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d under this subfactor, and a higher rating in the technical factor overall, had the Navy given Patrona\u2019s proposal proper credit.  Protest at 8 -9.  The agency disagrees, defending its evaluation of \nPatrona\u2019s technical approach as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  MOL   \nat 3-8. \n Under the technical approach subfactor, the RFP required offerors to respond to four sample problems, each of which required offerors to address various scenarios that implicate specific tasks identified in the solicitation\u2019s PWS and SOW .  COS at 2; RFP \nat 104-105.  The Navy would then evaluate the extent to which the offerors\u2019 responses \nto the four sample problems \u201cdemonstrates specific understanding, capability, and experience to successfully perform the requirements, and the soundness of the proposed tec hnical approach.\u201d  RFP at 114.   \n Patrona argues  that the Navy should have awarded Patrona additional strengths for \nnumerous aspects of the firm\u2019s  responses to these four sample problems.  In this \nregard, Patrona argues that its responses \u201crepeatedly went above and beyond specified performance requirements,\u201d which the Navy failed to recognize.   Protest at 8.   Patrona \ncites various  proposal  attributes that warranted recognition as strengths by the agency \nbut were instead \u201cimproperly discounted.\u201d  Id.  at 8-9.    Page 6    B-423282    \nThe Navy responds  that the evaluators reasonably determined that Patrona\u2019s proposal \nmet, but did not exceed, solicitation requirements.  MOL  at 6-7.  In support, the Navy \nprovided a declaration from the SSEB chairperson explaining why each of Patrona\u2019s \nclaimed strengths under the technical approach subfactor met, but did not exceed, solicitation requirements.  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 3- 5.  The Navy \nalso argues that the protester made no attempt in its protest pleadings to establish that the claimed strengths exceed specific solicitation requirements or otherwise meet the \nsolicitation\u2019s definition of a strength.\n3   MOL at 4.  In this regard, the Navy asserts  that \nPatrona\u2019s protest allegations instead rely on \u201cgeneralized and conclusory statements \nabout its claimed strengths,\u201d without any explanation for how these proposal features \nexceed requirements or would otherwise be entitled to a strength under the soli citation.  \nId. \n  \nOur Office has explained that an agency\u2019s judgment that proposal  features did not \nexceed the requirements of the solicitation--and thus did not warrant the assessment of \nunique strengths --is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion and one that we will not \ndisturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the ev aluation was \nunreasonable.  Protection Strategies, Inc ., B-416635, Nov. 1, 2018, 2019 CPD \u00b6 33 at 8 \nn.4.  Further , an agency\u2019s contemporaneous evaluation record is not required to prove a \nnegative or document all \u201cdeterminations of adequacy\u201d ( i.e., why a proposal did not \nreceive a strength or weakness).  See, e.g., Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al., \nNov. 13, 2020, 2021 CPD \u00b6 3 at 8.  When a protester raises a challenge regarding why a proposal was not assigned a strength or weakness, we review whether the agency\u2019s explanation or documentation--contemporaneous or otherwise--demonstrates that the \nevaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  Id . at 7 -8. \n \nBased on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Patrona\u2019s proposal  under this subfactor .  While  the protester repeatedly expresses \ndisagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment , Patrona does not demonstrate how its \nresponses to these four sample problems  exceeded solicitation requirements or  \nwarranted additional strengths or significant strengths.   \n \nFor example,  sample problem No. 1 required offerors to describe the planning, \ndevelopment, sustainment and execution tasks necessary to return a submarine to the fleet on a limited timeline, and the solicitation  identified various  specific  PWS\/SOW \ntasks applicable to such a scenario.  RFP at 104.  The protester  asserts that the agency \nunreasonably failed to proper ly credit Patrona\u2019s  response to sample problem N o.1 and \ncites Patrona\u2019s  reference to \u201cTable 5\u201d in its proposal as evidence of \u201cPatrona\u2019s expertise \nand knowledge\u201d of maintenance methodology for various submarine systems.  Protest \nat 8.  The protester, however,  provides no explanation for how the content within table 5 \nexceeds the solicitation requirements applicable to sample problem N o. 1 or would \n \n3 Relevant here, a strength was defined in the solicitation as \u201can aspect of an Offeror\u2019s \nproposal with merit or will exceed specified performance or capability requirements to the advantage of the Government during contract performance.\u201d  RFP at 113 .

The agency responds that Patrona\u2019s response to sample \nproblem No.1 \u201cdemonstrated that it understood the current SUBMEPP process it \ncurrently executes\u201d but \u201cprovided no additional benefits other than what the SSEB \nconsidered the minimum required to be successful.\u201d  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 3.  In this regar d, the agency notes  that Patrona\u2019s response \u201clacked \ndetail\u201d and \u201cwas written in a way that assumed the evaluation team knew the processes in which Patrona operated,\u201d which  relied on the evaluators \u201cto fill in many blanks to fully \nunderstand Patrona\u2019s responses.\u201d  Id .   \n Similarly, Patrona argues that its responses to sample problems N os. 2 and 3 identified \n\u201cmultiple additional resources\u201d that \u201cmitigate quality risk and encapsulate expertise Patrona has developed by supporting SUBMEPP since 2014.\u201d\n5  Protest at 9.  Patrona \nasserts that the agency did not \u201cconsider [] the substantial significance of these \nadditional documents.\u201d  Id.   Patrona also contends that it should have been awarded a \nstrength for the \u201crisk mitigation process\u201d detailed in its response to sample problem \nNo. 4.6  Id.  In support of this point , Patrona explains that under the incumbent contact it \nhas developed a virtual screening process for planned maintenance system service \nrequests, requiring independent screening of these requests by a second technician--a feature that adds \u201csignificant val ue for SUBMEPP.\u201d  Id .  The agency responds that the \nquality control resources Patrona references under sample problems Nos. 2 and 3, are \n\u201cexpected of any contractor that performed [the SOW  tasks associated with sample \nproblems Nos. 2 and 3].\u201d\n7  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. SSEB Chairperson at 4.  As for Patrona\u2019s \n \n4 By Patrona\u2019s own account,  table 5 simply \u201c identifies the processes and related \nproducts that address maintenance and modernization through submarine service life.\u201d  See AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona Technical Approach Proposal at 10.  \n5 Sample problem N o. 2 identified specific applicable PWS\/SOW sections and \nrequested the offeror\u2019s approach to ordering and completing three tasks involving a \nneglected safety feature, a new maintenance documentation requirement, and a response to set of ships failure data that was  transferred to the contractor in advance of \na scheduled maintenance event.  RFP at 104.  Sample problem N o. 3 also identified \nspecific PWS\/SOW tasks and requested, among other things, an equipment maintenance plan suitable for input into the Navy\u2019s planned maintenance system information system  (PMSMIS).  Id. at 104- 105.   \n6 Sample problem N o. 4 identified PWS\/SOW task 4.7 and requested the offeror to \nprovide submarine type commander (TYCOM) screening comments and TYCOM recommendations suitable for input into the PMSMIS database for a planned maintenance system service request.  RFP at 105.  \n7 Patrona also contends that the Navy should have assigned multiple strengths, and not \njust a single strength, for Patrona\u2019s \u201cinternal process guides and quality control checklists\u201d because these guides and checklists were \u201capplicable to multiple S ample \n(continued...)

As such, the agency argues the risk mitigation \nprocess did not warrant the assessment of a strength.   MOL at 7 -8. \n Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy\u2019s evaluation. In this regard, t he protester has not demonstrated that its responses to the sample \nproblems exceed solicitation requirements or that the agency unreasonably evaluated these aspects of Patrona\u2019s proposal.  Although Patrona may consider aspects of its technical approach to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis on which to sustain the protest. STG, Inc ., supra at 7. \n In addition, t hroughout its protest under this subfactor, Patrona argues that its proposal \nwas \u201cinformed by its experience performing the very same requirements\u201d sought  here \nand that its proposal included \u201cmeticulous detail that demonstrated its superior knowledge of the requirements, processes, and procedures\u201d required by the solicitation.  See Protest at 8- 9.  Although the protester denies that it is demanding credit for its \nincumbent experience, see Comments at 10- 11, we find that the protester\u2019s arguments, \nat their core, amount to a request that our Office substitute the agency\u2019s  judgment for \nthe protester \u2019s on the basis that Patrona\u2019s experience performing the incumbent \ncontract puts the firm in a  better position to determine whether its proposal exceeded \nthe solicitation\u2019s requirements.  We decline to do so.  See Systems Implementers, Inc.; Transcend Tech. Sys., LLC , B-418963.5 et al., June 1, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 138 at 16 \n(denying contention that prot ester\u2019s proposal merited assessment of multiple additional \nstrengths for various aspects of protester\u2019s experience where protester\u2019s view of its experience expressed nothing more than its disagreement with the evaluators\u2019 subjective judgments).  These allegations are denied.  \n \nManagement Approach Subfactor  \n Patrona next challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation under the management approach subfactor.  Protest at 10- 11.  Patrona makes two principal arguments.  First, the \nprotester  argues that its \u201cproven management approach,\u201d and the features and benefits \n \nProblems.\u201d  Protest at 9.  T he agency responds  that it reasonably assigned Patrona\u2019s \nproposal a single strength based on Patrona\u2019s internal process guides and quality \ncontrol checklists, in the aggregate, since they were applicable to all four sample problems .  AR, Exh. 10,  Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 4.  Based on our review of the \nrecord, we agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require the assignment of multiple  individual strengths for  repeat  occurrences of a positive aspect within an \nofferor\u2019s  response to each sample problem.  We thus deny this protest allegation.   Page 9    B-423282   it outlined in table 16 of its proposal, \u201cwarranted a higher rating than A cceptable.\u201d8  Id. \nat 11; Comments at 15.  Second, Patrona contends that the positive ratings it received \non its 2023 interim Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) \nassessment , reflecting its performance on the incumbent contract, should have \ntranslated to a rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d under the management approach subfactor.  \nProtest at 11.  In this regard, Patrona states that its management team and proposal \napproach mirror the team and approach it is using under the current incumbent contract \nwhere it has been recognized with several positive CPARS assessments.9  Id.   \n \nBased on our review of the record, we find no basis to sustain Patrona\u2019s protest.  First, \nalthough Patrona cites to the features and benefits included in table 16 of its proposal to \nargue for a higher rating under this subfactor, Patrona does not allege that the agency failed to consider these features.  Protest at 9- 10.  Nor does Patrona articulate how \nthese proposal features merit the assignment of a strength or a higher adjectival rating under this subfactor.  See id .  Instead, Patrona\u2019s protest simply r e-states the content of \nits proposal and notes its disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation conclusion, which \nas discussed above, does not provide a basis to sustain a protest.   See Perspecta \nEng\u2019g, Inc ., B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 314 at 7.  \n Additionally, the agency explains that the evaluators considered the information noted in \ntable 16 of Patrona\u2019s proposal, such as  the firm\u2019s  \u201cexperienced incumbent management \nteam\u201d and proposal to  \u201cmaintain an effective communication plan.\u201d  See AR, Exh. 10, \nDecl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5 -6.  The agency concluded that these features and \nothers in Patrona\u2019s proposal \u201csquarely met the requirements\u201d and \u201caligned with standard \nbusiness practices,\u201d but did not reflect an exceptional approach or provide anticipated \nvalue to the Navy that exceeded solicitation requirements.  Id.  On this record, we see \nno basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation judgment.\n10   \n \n8 For the management approach subfactor, the solicitation instructed offerors to \ndescribe their \u201coverall management approach including details about processes, tools, \nand other unique characteristics that demonstrate the ability to successfully manage this effort.\u201d  RFP at 105.  In turn, the agency would \u201cevaluate the extent to which the \nproposal demonstrates an effective management organization with the capability, processes, and tools to successfully perform the requirements and ensure the highest quality deliverables, communication, cost management, risk management, and subcontractor management.\u201d  Id. at 114.  The agency\u2019s evaluators assigned Patrona\u2019s \nmanagement approach proposal a rating of \u201cacceptable,\u201d noting that Patrona\u2019s management approach \u201cmeets requirements and indicated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.\u201d  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.   \n \n9 Patrona notes that it received positive CPARS assessments spanning the time period \nbetween December 2020 and December 2023.  Comments  at 13.  \n10 Patrona further argues that the agency\u2019s documentation under this subfactor is \n\u201cscant ,\u201d and the protest should accordingly be sustained.  Protest at 11.  We disagree.  \nAlthough we note that the contemporaneous  evaluation record rests on conclusory \n(continued...)   Page 10    B-423282    \nFinally, we see no basis to find that the agency was required to align its evaluation findings under the management approach subfactor with Patrona\u2019s prior CPARS ratings on the incumbent contract.  The solicitation\u2019s submission instructions for the management approach subfactor did not request past performance references, nor did the evaluation criteria apprise offerors that the agency would be assessing records of past performance when assessing proposals under the management approach \nsubfactor.  See  RFP at 105, 114.  \n The protester essentially urges that the agency\u2019s understanding of Patrona\u2019s performance on the incumbent contract should have supplemented the Navy\u2019s evaluation of the text of Patrona\u2019s management approach proposal.  We disagree.  We see no requirement in the evaluation criteria that would obligate the agency to consider \nan offeror\u2019s prior incumbent performance--as opposed to the various descriptions of the offeror\u2019s management approach the agency requested, and committed to evaluate, under this subfactor.   Additionally, while our decisions have concluded that, in some \ncases, past performance information in the agency\u2019s possession cannot be ignored, we have specifically declined to extend that principle to an agency\u2019s evaluation of technical proposals.  See Enterprise Sols. Realized, Inc. ; Unissant, Inc ., B-409642, B -409642.2, \nJune 23, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 201 at 9.  As such, we find no merit to Patrona\u2019s arguments  \nhere and accordingly deny these protest grounds.  \n \nPersonnel Approach Subfactor  \n The protester next argues that the agency failed to evaluate Patrona\u2019s staffing plan and \nkey personnel in accordance with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria, and that had the Navy done so, the agency would have assigned Patrona\u2019s proposal  several strengths \nand significant strengths --and the highest possible adjectival rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d  \n \nstatements  about Patrona\u2019s management approach proposal , see AR, Exh.  4, SSEB \nReport  at 21, as noted above, t he agency submitted,  with the agency report, a \ndeclaration from the SSEB chairperson providing  additional details  supporting the \nevaluators\u2019 conclusions .  AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6.  While we \naccord greater weight to contemporaneous materials as opposed to judgments made in response to protest contentions, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed \nrationale for contemporaneous c onclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded \ndetails, will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection \ndecisions --so long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the \ncontemporaneous record.  Science & Tech. Corp., B -420216, Jan. 3, 2022, 2022 CPD \n\u00b6 1 at 8 n.6.  Here, we find that the agency\u2019s post -protest statement  fills in previously \nunrecorded details and provides credible explanations that are consistent with the \ncontemporaneous record.   See, e.g. , AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of SSEB Chairperson at 5- 6 \n(explaining that the evaluators considered the specific features of Patrona\u2019s management approach proposal but concluded that these features \u201cdid not provide  \nanticipated value to the Navy beyond the requirements, such as proposing improvements to process efficiency or quality control\u201d) .    Page 11    B-423282   under the personnel approach subfactor.  Protest at 12- 13.  In this regard, Patrona \nmakes two general allegations.  First, Patrona argues that the agency failed to consider \nqualifications information for non- key personnel that Patrona included in its staff ing plan.  \nId.  Second, Patrona contends that the Navy did not give Patrona sufficient credit for the \nqualifications of the key personnel it proposed.  Id.   The agency responds that the \nsolicitation did not obligate or permit the agency to evaluate the qualification information Patrona elected to include for its proposed non- key personnel.  MOL at 10- 15.  In \naddition, the Navy argues that its evaluation of Patrona\u2019s staffing plan and key personnel was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  Id.   For the reasons \nexplained below, we deny this protest ground.  \n By way of background, f or the staffing plan submission, offerors were required to use \nthe format provided in RFP attachment 6.1.  RFP at 105;  AR, Exh. 2,  RFP attach. 6.1, \nStaffing P lan.

Offerors were instructed to use the required format \nto align the proposed mix of personnel with the labor hours identified in RFP section B and RFP attachment 6.2.  RFP at 105; RFP attach. 6.2 at  1.  As relevant here, the \nrequired format in RFP attachment 6.1 was a Microsoft excel spreadsheet that included columns for the names of proposed personnel, whether the individual is key or non- key, \nthe PWS\/SOW task area the individual would support, the i ndividual\u2019s proposed labor \nhours, and a final column labeled \u201cnotes.\u201d  RFP attach. 6.1.  Finally, the solicitation instructed that when filling out the staffing plan spreadsheet, offerors should \u201cuse \u2018TBD\u2019 [to be determined]  for non- key positions that do not have identified personnel.\u201d  RFP    \nat 105.   \n    Non-Key Personnel  \n The protester argues that the solicitation required the agency to assess the individual qualifications and experience information for the non- key personnel identified in \nPatrona\u2019s  staffing plan.  Protest at 12- 13.  Patrona asserts that it \u201cincluded by name \nnearly 100 non- key incumbent personnel\u201d and included in the \u201cnotes\u201d column in the \nstaffing plan a \u201cvast amount of information\u201d for its incumbent non- key personnel \nconcerning thei r qualifications, certifications, and years of experience.  Id. at 13.  The \nprotester contends that had the agency evaluated the qualifications of its non- key \npersonnel, Patrona would have received strengths and a \u201chigher rating due to the qualified and experienced individuals \u201d included in its staffing plan.  Id. at 12- 13. \n The Navy disagrees, arguing that the solicitation did not contemplate the assessment of individual qualifications for  non-key personnel.  MOL at 10- 13.  The Navy contends that \nPatrona\u2019s interpretation \u201cread[s] an unstated evaluation requirement \u201d into the solicitation \nand is contradicted by the solicitation\u2019s restriction barring the agency from considering \nnon-key personnel resume information.  Id. at 11- 12.  The Navy notes that the \nsolicitation did not request qualifications information for non- key personnel, and the \nrequired format for the staffing plan in RFP attachment 6.1 did not include a column for  \nthe qualifications for non- key personnel.  Id.  at 11.  Instead, as noted above, the  Page 12    B-423282   offeror\u2019s staffing plan was to include information on whether the employee was key or \nnon-key, the labor category, labor hours proposed, and the PWS\/SOW task the \nemployee would support.  Id. (citing RFP, attach. 6.1).  The solicitation requested this \ninformation so the Navy could evaluate the extent to which the offerors\u2019 staffing plan addressed  the labor hours identified in RFP section B and confirm that the proposed \npersonnel would perform all aspects of the PWS\/SOW.  Id. (citing RFP at  114).   \n The Navy maintains that Patrona improperly used the \u201cnotes\u201d column of the required labor mix  to insert resume qualifications information for non- key personnel --which the \nsolicitation expressly prohibited the agency from considering.  See MOL  at 11- 12 (citing \nRFP attach. 6.2 at 6).  The protester responds that \u201c [t]he fact that the S olicitation stated \nthat the A gency would not evaluate resumes for non- key personnel does not mean that \nthe Agency could not consider their qualifications.\u201d  Comments  at 19.   \n When a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of  its provisions.  MSK TriTech Group, LLC , B-421814, Oct. 3, 2023, 2023 \nCPD \u00b6 235 at 6.  An interpretation is not reasonable if it fails to give meaning to all of a solicitation\u2019s provisions, renders any part of the solicitation absurd or surplus, or creates conflicts.  HumanTouch, LLC , B-419880 et al., Aug. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 283 at 6. \nHere, we find that the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, and the protester\u2019s is not.   \n At the outset,  we note that the relevant  solicitation criterion--requiring the agency to  \nevaluate the extent to which the \u201cstaffing plan and key personnel [] are qualified, experienced, and suitable for performing the requirements,\u201d see RFP at 114-- appear s to \nsuggest the agency was required to evaluate the individual qualifications of all non- key \npersonnel identified in an offeror\u2019s staffing plan, as urged by the protester.  This reading, \nhowever, fails to give effect to the solicitation language as a whole . \n First, we disagree that the solicitation obligated the agency to evaluate the individual qualifications of non- key personnel that Patrona elected to submit with its staffing plan.  \nThe RFP instructed that offerors \u201cshall\u201d provide a staffing plan using the format provided in attachment 6.1, staffing plan, and in accordance with attachment 6.2, personnel qualifications.  RFP at 105.  As noted above, this required format did not include a column requesting the input of any qualifications information for non- key personnel.  \nSee id .  Moreover, the solicitation included a clear statement indicating that \u201c[r]esumes \nsubmitted for N on-Key Personnel [] will not be evaluated.\u201d   RFP attach. 6.2 at 6.   \n Reading the solicitation as a whole to give effect to all provisions, it is clear that the staffing plan portion of the personnel approach evaluation was intended to assess offerors\u2019 proposed labor mix es for labor category mapping purposes, to ensure the \nstaffing plan was aligned with section B, and to confirm that offerors could meet all requirements in the PWS\/SOW.  See RFP at 105- 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 1- 3.  \nThis portion of the evaluation is in contrast with the key personnel evaluation, which, as noted above, involved a request for resumes  for the purpose of  evaluating the specific \nqualifications of nine identified key personnel .  RFP at 106, 114; RFP attach. 6.2 at 3- 6.   Page 13    B-423282   Although the sentence in the evaluation criteria, as noted above,  is not a model of \nclarity, it is clear from the solicitation as a whole that  the agency did not intend to \nrequest, or evaluate, individual qualifications information for the many non- key \npersonnel (as opposed to the nine identified key personnel) an offeror could include in \nits staffing plan.  \n Moreover , we find that the vast majority of information Patrona included in the notes \ncolumn for its identified non- key personnel to be, in all practical effect, resume \ninformation.\n11  Faulting the agency for not evaluating individual qualifications information \nfor non- personnel that Patrona inserted into the notes column in the staffing plan would \nrender extraneous and absurd the solicitation\u2019s prohibition on evaluating resumes for \nnon-key personnel.  Cf. HumanTouch, LLC , supra at 6; CACI, Inc. --Fed., B-422774, \nB-422774.2, Oct. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 257.  We thus decline to adopt any \ninterpretation that eschews the plain intent of the solicitation to evaluate resume qualifications information for the nine identified key personnel positions only.\n12  As a \nresult, we see no basis to sustain Patrona\u2019s protest based on the argument that the Navy was obligated to assign strengths or significant strengths to Patrona\u2019s proposal because of alleged superior qualifications of Patrona\u2019s non- key personnel.\n13   \n \n11 For example, the notes column for non- key personnel in Patrona\u2019s staffing plan \nincluded such information as the individual\u2019s number of years of professional experience, current position, educational history, professional certifications, and years of experience on the SUBMEPP contract, among other highlighted qualifications, see AR, Exh. 7.2, Patrona Staffing Plan Proposal, which is closely aligned with the information the solicitation requested to be included in resumes for key personnel.  See RFP attach. 6.2 at 6 (requesting \u201c number of years of professional experience, current \nposition\/title\/employer, educational history, chronology of professional experience, [and] current level of security experience\u201d ). \n12 To the extent that the protester\u2019s arguments can be read as a challenge to the lack of \nclarity in the solicitation, we note any ambiguity here was apparent from the face of the \nsolicitation.  As such, the ambiguity was patent, and any post -award challenge to these  \nsolicitation terms would be untimely.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1).  \n13 We note that the unclear solicitation language at issue here is nearly identical to the \nsolicitation language in CACI, Inc. --Fed. , supra, where a protester challenged the \nNavy\u2019s failure to evaluate the qualifications of the awardee\u2019s non- key personnel, which \nthe protester argued would have revealed deficiencies in the awardee\u2019s proposal.  Id .  \nOur Office found the protester\u2019s argument to be unreasonable given \u201clanguage in the solicitation that allowed offerors to use unidentified \u2018TBD\u2019 employees for non- key \npersonnel positions.\u201d  Id . at 11.  As our Office explained, because offerors could \npropose \u201cTBD\u201d for non- key personnel, interpretating the solicitation to require the \nagency to evaluate all non- key personnel qualifications to determine compliance with \nminimum qualifications would \u201ccreate an absurd situation where the solicitation permitted offerors to submit proposals that would be impossible for the agency to evaluate in accordance with the solicitation.\u201d  Id.    \n(continued...)   Page 14    B-423282    \n   Key Personnel  \n The protester also argues that the Navy should have assigned Patrona a strength \nbecause all nine of Patrona\u2019s key personnel met  or exceeded solicitation requirements , \nincluding meeting or exceeding many of the \u201cdesired qualifications\u201d identified in the solicitation .  Protest at  13; Comments at 21- 27.  In particular, the protester asserts that \nthe Navy should have assigned a strength for Patrona\u2019s proposed senior technical representative, who Patrona contends exceeds the solicitation\u2019s \u201cdesired experience and education criteria\u201d and has over 25 years of experience leading submarine maintenance technical teams for SUBMEPP.  Protest at  13 (citing AR, Exh. 7.1, Patrona \nTechnical Proposal at 34); Comments at 21- 27.   \n The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably assessed the qualifications represented by Patrona\u2019s proposed key personnel .  MOL at 14.  The evaluators noted \nthat Patrona\u2019s proposed key personnel were \u201csuited to perform the requirements, inclusive of the S enior Technical Representative, \u201d and determined that \u201cthe capabilities \nand qualifications of the K ey Personnel are adequate to perform the tasking for which \nthey are proposed.\u201d   AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 21.  In addition, the Navy included a \ndeclaration from the SSEB chairperson stating that \u201c[t]he SSEB reviewed the key personnel in total for each offeror and found that while some of Patrona\u2019s key personnel met or exceeded some of the desired qualifications, many other s of Patrona\u2019s key \npersonnel did not meet or exceed the desired qualifications.\u201d   AR, Exh. 10, Decl. of \nSSEB Chairperson at 7.   As an example, the agency notes that one of the individuals \nproposed for a key personnel position did not have the minimum  desired 10 years of \nsupervisory experience, and another did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree in an engineering discipline.  Id.  The Navy explai ns that when deciding whether to assess strengths  \nunder this subfactor , the evaluators  assessed the \u201csum total of all personnel\u201d in \nPatrona\u2019s proposal  and determined that the proposed key personnel , in the aggregate,  \n\u201cadequately met the requirements,\u201d even if each key personnel  proposed \u201cdid not meet \nor exceed all desired qualifications .\u201d  Id.   \n \nIn response to the Navy\u2019s urging that we adopt a similar position here, Patrona contends that, although the instant solicitation has a comparable provision allowing offerors to submit \u201cTBD\u201d for non -key personnel, see RFP at  105, the same absurd result \nidentified in CACI, Inc. --Fed would not arise.  See Comments at  20.  In this regard, \nPatrona does not argue that the solicitation required the agency to disqualify the awardee based on deficiencies in the awardee\u2019s non- key personnel staffing plan but \ninstead argues that the agency was required to evaluate t he qualifications of the non-\nkey personnel Patrona chose to identify in its staffing plan.   See id.  Although we \nacknowledge this distinction, we ultimately conclude that it produces no meaningful difference to the outcome here.  In this regard, reading the solicitation language as a whole and giving effect to all provisions --including the solicitation\u2019s  prohibition on \nevaluating resumes for non- key personnel --we agree with the Navy that the solicitation \nhere did not require the agency to assess the qualifications of the non- key personnel \nthat Patrona elected to include in its staffing plan proposal.    Page 15    B-423282    \nOn this record, we can find no basis to sustain Patrona\u2019s protest.   While the protester \nmay believe it is entitled to a strength or  strengths because several of its proposed key \npersonnel met or exceeded certain desired qualifications , the record shows that the \nagency was aware of both the benefits  and shortcomings  presented by  Patrona\u2019s key \npersonnel  proposal  and reasonably  determined that Patrona\u2019s key personnel, overall,  \ndid not merit a strength.  Although the protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s judgment, the protester has not shown that it was unreasonable for the agency to assess the overall qualifications represented by Patrona\u2019s  key personnel proposal  when deciding \nwhether to assign strengths.  See Assessment & Training Sols. Consulting Corp.,        \nB-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 177 at 15- 16 (finding protester \nwas not entitled to additional strengths for meeting desired qualifications, where the \nagency was aware of the benefits of the protester\u2019s proposal and the protester did not show that the agency\u2019s assignment of strengths was unreasonable) .  Accordingly, these \nallegations are denied.  \n Past Performance  Next, Patrona raises various challenges to the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  \nPatrona argues that the agency unreasonably failed to consider the relevant past performance of Patrona\u2019s subcontractor on the incumbent project, ICI Services Corporation (ICI).  Patrona also argues that the Navy gave outsized weight to several \nnegative performance issues that Patrona experienced on the incumbent contract.  In addition, Patrona contends that the agency unreasonably determined that one of Patrona\u2019s  past per formance references was only \u201csomewhat relevant.\u201d  The protester \ncontends that had the Navy not made these errors, Patrona would have been assigned the highest rating of \u201csubstantial confidence\u201d instead of the second highest rating of \u201csatisfactory confidence. \u201d\n14  Protest at 13- 17; Comments at 29- 30. \n The Navy responds that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  The agency argues that it  acted within its discretion to not double count the \nsame record of past performance, which reflected the two entities\u2019  (Patrona and ICI)  \nperformance on the incumbent contract.  The Navy also argues that it reasonably considered Patrona\u2019s performance issues on the incumbent contract, which included staffing shortfalls and alleged falsified timesheets.  Finally, the Navy argues that the evaluators analyzed Patrona\u2019s \u201creference N o. 2\u201d and reasonably determined that it was \nonly somewhat relevant when compared to the scope of this solicitation.  MOL at 15- 18; \nSupp. MOL at  4-6. \n \n14 Patrona also argued initially that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate the past \nperformance proposal submitted by KMS.  Protest at 17.  After the agency argued that its evaluation of KMS\u2019s past performance was reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation, the protester failed to address this argument in comments.  See  generally \nComments.  Accordingly, we dismiss th is allegation as abandoned and do not consider \nit further.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3(i)(3); Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr. 12, 2023, 2023 \nCPD \u00b6 92 at 4 n.3.   Page 16    B-423282    \nAt the outset, we note that an agency\u2019s evaluation of past performance, including its  consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of an offeror\u2019s performance  history, is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency\u2019s  \nassessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria.  \nCrowderGulf, LLC et al. , B-418693.9 et al., Mar. 25, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 90 at 20; \nMetropolitan Interpreters & Translators, Inc ., B-415080.7, B -415080.8, May 14, 2019,  \n2019 CPD \u00b6 181 at 10.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment does  not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  CrowderGulf, supra at 20.  \nAdditionally, there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  ENGlobal Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. , B-419612, B -419612.2, May 14, 2021, \n2021 CPD \u00b6 214 at 4- 5. \n As discussed below, the record here demonstrates that the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria.   \n First, we find that the Navy reasonably considered the reference Patrona submitted for its subcontractor, ICI, for work ICI performed with Patrona on the incumbent contract.  The record shows that the Navy considered both Patrona\u2019s and ICI\u2019s performance on \nthe incumbent contract to be \u201crecent\u201d and \u201cvery relevant,\u201d since the efforts on the incumbent contract \u201cinvolve[] essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and \ncomplexities this solicitation requires.\u201d  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 26.  The evaluat ors \nalso noted that the reference that Patrona submitted for ICI was the same reference that Patrona submitted for itself as the prime contractor on the incumbent contract.  Id.  The \nevaluators considered this reference, but ultimately concluded that considering this record twice would \u201cnot add any additional value to the overall past performance assessment[.]\u201d  Id.  \n The protester argues that the Navy was obligated to give Patrona double credit  for this \nreference, but the solicitation here gave no indication that the agency was required to assign a single past performance reference twice as much weight when the reference was submitted on behalf of both a prime contractor and its subcontractor.  Rather, since the R FP informed offerors that the agency intended to assess \u201cthe usefulness of the \ninformation\u201d when assigning the confidence rating, see RFP at 115, we see no iss ue \nwith the Navy\u2019s determination that considering the same reference twice would not add any significant value to the agency\u2019s past performance assessment or its confidence in Patrona\u2019s performance.   \n In addition, Patrona included in its own past performance proposal the following statement:  \u201cICI\u2019s contributions to the SUBMEPP contract are covered under the P rime \nContractor [Patrona] CPARS.\u201d  AR, Exh. 7.3, Patrona Past Performance Proposal at 8.  \nIn this regard, Patrona\u2019s proposal informed the agency that it considered this CPARS to \ncover the performance history of both entities on the incumbent contract.   On this \nrecord, we find no basis to fault the agency for exercising reasonable discretion to not \ndouble- count this reference--particularly when Patrona\u2019s own proposal informed the  Page 17    B-423282   Navy that Patrona considered ICI\u2019s contributions  to be \u201ccovered under\u201d the record of \npast performance that  Patrona submitted for the incumbent project.  See id.  \n \nSecond, we find that the Navy reasonably considered and weighed several negative performance issues, along with the positive ratings on Patrona\u2019s CPARS, for the incumbent project.  The record shows that the Navy considered Patrona\u2019s CPARS \nratings of \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csatisfactory\u201d on the incumbent contract, noting also that performance on the incumbent contract was considered \u201cvery relevant\u201d given the \u201cminimal differences between the existing contract and this solicitation.\u201d  AR, Exh. 4, SSEB Report  at 23.  However, the Navy identified \u201ctwo major performance issues\u201d on \nthe incumbent contract --both of which, the agency indicated, \u201csignificantly decreases \nthe Government\u2019s confidence in Patrona being able to successful[ly] execute this \ncontract with minimal risk.\u201d  Id.   \n In this regard, the agency\u2019s evaluators explained that after a suspected discrepancy  \nreported on a voucher Patrona submitted for the incumbent contract , between the \nobserved work hours and the certified hours, the agency conducted an audit confirming that Patrona billed for hours that were not worked.  Id. at 23- 24.  The agency further \nexplained that Patrona amended the voucher and removed the inaccurately charged hours, but that this issue nevertheless raised \u201csignificant concern with the ability of Patrona to maintain accurate accounting of their work\u201d which \u201cincreases the risk of successful contract execution without the presence of fraud, waste or abuse.\u201d  Id. at 24.  \nAdditionally , the agency identified a persistent issue with \u201cPatrona\u2019s inability to maintain \nstaffing levels\u201d consistent with the staffing levels for positions identified in its fixed- price \ntasking.  Id.   In this regard, the evaluators noted that the Navy  endured \u201cperiods of \nunderstaffing while being billed for the entire [fixed- price] amount.\u201d  Id.   The evaluators \n\u201cacknowledged the efforts Patrona was taking to resolve the issue,\u201d but concluded that the \u201cinability of Patrona to adequately staff positions on the contract decreases the level of confidence that Patrona can successfully execute the task ing of this solicitation.\u201d  Id.  \n Patrona argues that \u201cthese incidents should not have negatively impacted Patrona\u2019s Past Performance rating, as Patrona took prompt action to rectify these isolated issues.\u201d  \nProtest at 16.  In this regard, Patrona argues that the Navy should have given greater weight to Patrona\u2019s explanations in its proposal concerning how it \u201cpromptly address ed \nand resolved\u201d those performance issues.  See id. at 15- 16.  Beyond Patrona\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Navy\u2019s evaluation judgment, however, Patrona has not provided our Office any basis to question the Navy\u2019s consideration of Patrona\u2019s performance \nissues on this \u201cvery relevant\u201d contract.\n 15   \n \n15 Because we find that the agency reasonably considered these two \u201cmajor \nperformance issues\u201d on Patrona\u2019s \u201cvery relevant\u201d incumbent project, AR, Exh. 4, SSEB \nReport  at 23, we see no basis to conclude that the agency would have raised Patrona\u2019s \npast performance rating beyond the second- highest rating of \u201csatisfactory confidence,\u201d \neven if the protester\u2019s other challenges to the past performance evaluation were to be sustained.

Patrona contends that the Navy improperly overlooked the similarities between \nthe two projects, arguing that the Navy ignored the many references to relevant sections of the SOW that Patrona included with this past performance reference.

The Navy argues in response that the solicitation required offerors to include \n\u201ca written explanation describing [] how the work was or is relevant to the work being proposed in this solicitation,\u201d see  RFP, attach. 6.3, but that Patrona only listed \u201ca series \nof SOW citations, without providing any context.\u201d  Supp. MOL at 3.  As a result, the Navy contends that it assessed the information Patrona provided and came to the reasonable conclusion that the pr oject was only \u201csomewhat relevant.\u201d  Id. at 6. \n We can find no basis to question the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  As our \nOffice has said repeatedly, an offeror is responsible for submitting a well -written \nproposal with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the procuring a gency.  See  FEDSYNC BEI, LLC,  B-417492, B -417492.2, July 23, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 303 at 10 (finding that  agency reasonably did not credit  a protester\u2019s past \nperformance reference that \u201clisted functional requirements of the PWS without any \nexplanati on of how the incumbent\u2019s performance of that requirement satisfied the RFP\u2019s \nrequirements.\u201d).  Based on our review of the record, we see no basis to question the Navy\u2019s conclusions about the relevance of this project.   \n In sum, w e see no merit to the protester\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nPatrona\u2019s past performance; as a result, these allegations are denied.  \n Best-Value  Determination \n As a final matter, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s best -value determination  \nwas improper because it was based on a flawed evaluation.

(AMSG), a service- disabled veteran-\nowned small business (SDVOSB) of Dumfries, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task \norder to Harkcon, Inc., an SDVOSB of Fredericksburg, Virginia, under request for \nquotations (RFQ) No. 89233122QNA000226, issued by the Department of Energy, \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  under the agency\u2019s technical, \nengineering, and programmatic services (TEPS III) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) .  \nThe RFQ sought administrative support services for the Office of Secure Transportation \n(OST).  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of vendors\u2019  \nquotations, as well as the best -value tradeoff decision.    \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order. This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423290; B -423290.2   BACKGROUND  \n \nOn September 4, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, NNSA issued the RFQ to holders of the agency\u2019s TEPS III  BPA.  Agency \nReport (AR), Tab 2, RFQ\n1; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law \n(COS\/MOL) at 3.  The RFQ  sought a contractor to provide administrative support , \nincluding  project and budget analysis, document controls, payroll data entry, travel \nvoucher processing, invoice tracking, purchase request processing, and technical editing and writing.  COS\/MOL at 3.   The RFQ anticipated the issuance of a task order \nwith a 1 -year base period, four 1- year option periods, and a 6- month option to extend \nservices o n a primarily fixed- price basis with a time- and-materials component for travel.   \nRFQ at  13; COS \/MOL  at 4. \n The RFQ provided that the agency intended to issue a task order to the vendor whose quotation represented the best value, considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  technical narrative\/approach, staffing approach, key personnel resume, past performance, and price.  RFQ at 61- 68.  The nonprice factors, \nwhen combined, were significantly more important than price.  Id.  at 61.  The RFQ \nadvised vendors that the agency would not issue a task order \u201cat a price premium it consider s disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated non- price \nsuperiority,\u201d and to the extent quotations were found to be close or similar in merit under the nonprice factors, price was more likely to be determinative.  Id.  at 68.  \n Relevant here, for the key personnel resume factor, vendors were required to provide a resume for the proposed program manager.  RFQ at 63.   The RFQ provided that the \nagency would evaluate the resume to assess whether the individual\u2019s education, \nexperience, and security clearance level demonstrated  the individual\u2019s expertise and \nability to successful ly perform the role in executing the relevant PWS tasks.  Id.   The \nRFQ did not identify any key personnel position other than the program manager.   \n NNSA received four quotations prior to the October 3 submission deadline, and the technical evaluation panel (TEP) determined that  only Harkcon and AMSG submitted \ntechnically acceptable quotations , leaving the other  vendors ineligible for award .\n2  \nCOS\/MOL at 7.   \n \n1 The agency issued two amendments to the RFQ.  Amendment 2, issued on \nSeptember 24, 2024, provided the final version of the performance work statement  \n(PWS) , instructions, and evaluation criteria, and all citations to the RFQ in this decision \nrefer to the version issued with amendment 2.  \n2 As discussed further below, Harkcon submitted a quotation as a member of a \ncontractor teaming arrangement (CTA).  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  A CTA under  the General Services Administration\u2019s  (GSA)  federal \nsupply schedule (FSS)  program  is a written agreement between two or more schedule \ncontractors to work together to meet an agency \u2019s requirements and to maximize a \nvendor \u2019s competitiveness.  See GSA CTA Guidance, \n(continued...)   Page 3    B-423290; B -423290.2   When NNSA evaluated Harkcon\u2019s quotation, the agency sent Harkcon clarification \nquestions concerning its proposed program manager.  First, the agency asked Harkcon to confirm that its proposed program manager would be available on- site at OST \nheadquarters, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  \nLater, NNSA sent Harkcon a second question, noting that Harkcon proposed to capture 100 percent of the incumbent personnel but proposed a Harkcon employee as the program manager .  AR, Tab 9, Second Clarification at 2.  NNSA asked if Harkcon \nintended to capture the incumbent program manager and utilize its proposed program manager.  Id.   Harkcon responded, in relevant part:  \u201cHarkcon is proposing [our \nemployee] as the key person, but could capture the incumbent [program manager] upon award.\u201d  Id.  at 1.   \n The TEP evaluated the quotations submitted by AMSG and Harkcon as follows\n3: \n \n AMSG  Harkcon  \nTechnical\/Narrative Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  \nStaffing Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  \nKey Personnel Resume  Exceptional  Exceptional  \nPast Performance  Pass  Pass  \nPrice  $11,746,269  $10,498,864  \n COS\/MOL at 8.  \n The contracting officer, who was also the source selection official (SSO) reviewed the TEP\u2019s findings for each quotation.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award at 10- 11, 12- 13.  The \nSSO noted that the quotations submitted by Harkcon and AMSG were equally rated under the nonprice factors, and Harkcon offered a price that was nearly 12 percent \nlower than the price offered by AMSG.  Id. at 17.  The SSO found that each vendor has \n\u201cthe same very high probability of successful performance\u201d and \u201cnone of the unique \n \nwww.gsa.gov\/contractorteamarrangements.  The CTA details the responsibilities of \neach team member.  Id.  CTAs under GSA schedule contracts differ from traditional \nprime contractor -subcontractor arrangements in that:  (1) each team member has privity \nof contract with the government for the goods or services that it is providing, (2) each team member is responsible for its duties laid out in the CTA document, and (3) each team member must have a GSA schedule contract.   Id.; see also Veterans Healthcare \nSupply Sols., Inc. , B-409888, Sept. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 269 at 4.  Here, Harkcon is a \nmember of a CTA, led by MELE Associates, Inc., the TEPS III BPA holder.  See  AR, \nTab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 4; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  Harkcon does not hold a BPA.    \n3 In evaluating AMSG\u2019s quotation, the agency identified 11 strengths under the technical \nnarrative\/approach factor, six strengths under the staffing approach factor, and four strengths under the key personnel factor.  COS\/MOL at 8.  In evaluating Harkcon\u2019s quotation, the TEP  assigned eight strengths under the technical narrative\/approach \nfactor, four strengths under the staffing approach factor, and three strengths under the key personnel resume factor.  Id.    Page 4    B-423290; B -423290.2   attributes or strengths of AMSG\u2019s proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an \nadditional 11.9 [percent] price premium.\u201d  Id.   The SSO stated that price was the \n\u201cdecisive factor,\u201d and she selected Harkcon\u2019s quotation for award.  Id.   \n On January 13, 2025, NNSA issued the task order to Harkcon.  COS\/MOL at 15.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of Harkcon\u2019s proposal and the best -value tradeoff decision.  In filing and pursuing this protest, AMSG  \nhas made arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed below.  While we do not address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester \u2019s \narguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest .\n4 \n At the outset, we note w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS contractors \nunder FAR subpart 8.4, we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation \nis reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Technology, Automation \n& Mgmt., Inc., B -418063.3, B -418063.4, Oct. 2, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  343 at 6.   In \nreviewing a protest challenging an agency \u2019s technical evaluation, our Office will not \nreevaluate the quotations; rather, we will examine the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  TSC Enter., LLC , \nB-415731, Feb. 8, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 71 at 2.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the \n \n4 For example, the protester  alleges that the agency treated the offerors unequally by \nassigning Harkcon\u2019s quotation a strength for its approach to travel voucher processing and not assigning AMSG\u2019s quotation a strength for an \u201cidentical feature\u201d -- [DELETED] .  \nComments & Supp. Protest at 25.  Where a protester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the vendors \u2019 quotations .  Cloud All., Inc. , B-422884, Dec. 3, 2024, \n2024 CPD \u00b6  294 at 6.   \nHere, contrary to AMSG\u2019s claims, NNSA assigned a strength to Harkcon\u2019s quotation \nbecause the TEP found that the \u201c approach . . . demonstrate[ d] a commitment to \naccuracy, efficiency, and responsiveness, \u201d and the methodology involved \u201cmeticulous \nverification\u201d and \u201cprompt resolution.\u201d  AR, Tab 11, Harkcon TEP Report  at 4.  The TEP \nwrote:  \u201cThis comprehensive and professional approach enhances the overall travel experience and boosts operational efficiency.\u201d  Id.   The TEP did not assign a strength to \nthe awardee\u2019s quotation because it proposed to [DELETED] --as AMSG claims --and the \nprotester  has not demonstrated that its quotation included the same features as \nHarkcon\u2019s.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.     Page 5    B-423290; B -423290.2   agency \u2019s judgment does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Amyx, \nInc., B-416734.2, Apr. 9, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6  143 at 3.  \n \nAvailability of Proposed Program Manager    \n The protester alleges that Harkcon either misrepresented the availability of its proposed program manager or engaged in a \u201c bait and switch\u201d  scheme, and AMSG asserts that \nNNSA should have found Harkon\u2019s quotation ineligible for award.  Protest at 16.  The protester elaborates  that Harkcon has been recruiting for the position since before \naward, Harkcon attempted to recruit the incumbent program manager, and AMSG \nclaims  the individual Harkcon proposed as its program manager cannot serve as a full -\ntime program  manager because he holds three other positions within the company.  \nComments & Supp. Protest at 8- 12.   \n The issue of whether personnel identified in a vendor \u2019s quotation will, in fact, perform \nunder the subsequently -awarded contract is generally a matter of contract \nadministration that our Office does not review.  DarkStar Intelligence, LLC , B-420609, \nB-420609.2, June 24, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 153 at 6; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5(a).  \nNonetheless, our Office will consider allegations that an offeror proposed personnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to provide during contract performance in order t o obtain a more favorable evaluation, as such a material misrepresentation has \nan adverse effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system.  DarkStar \nIntelligence, supra.   Our decisions refer to such circumstances as a \u201c bait and switch. \u201d  \nId.  To establish an impermissible bait and switch, a protester must show that:  (1) the \nawardee either knowingly or negligently represented that it would rely on specific \npersonnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to furnish during contract performance; (2) the misrepresentation was relied on by the agency; and (3) the \nagency \u2019s reliance had a material effect on the evaluation results.   Id.  \n On this record, we find that AMSG has not established that Harkcon engaged in an impermissible bait and switch.   As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that Harkcon\u2019s \nrecruiting efforts mandate the conclusion that Harkcon proposed a program manager that it did not intend to use.  For one,  as noted above, in its quotation Harkcon proposed \nto capture the incumbent personnel --including the program manager.  AR, Tab 9, \nSecond Clarification at 1- 2.  As such, engagement with the incumbent program \nmanager is c onsistent with Harkcon\u2019s proposed approach and provides no basis to \naccept the protester\u2019s allegation that Harkcon made a misrepresentation.\n5  DarkStar \nIntelligence, supra.          \n \n \n5 Additionally, our Office has found that the mere fact that an awardee recruited \nincumbent personnel  after award does not establish that the proposed personnel are \nunavailable to perform ; it is neither unusual nor inherently improper for an awardee to \nrecruit and hire personnel previously employed by an incumbent contractor.

Page 6    B-423290; B -423290.2   In addition, while AMSG has provided our Office with a Harkcon job posting seeking a \nproject manager to support a Department of Energy contract, evidence of recruitment \nefforts does not establish a knowing or negligent representation by Harkcon that it planned to rely on a specific program manager that it did not expect to furnish during performance.  See ICF Inc., L.L.C. , B-419049.3, B -419049.4, Mar ch 9, 2021, 2021 CPD \n\u00b6 117 at 8- 9.  Accordingly, the protester  has not provided any reasonable evidence to \nsupport its misrepresentation allegations.   We are also not persuaded by AMSG\u2019s argument that the proposed program manager \nis unavailable to perform because he holds other positions within Harkcon.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 9.  The record shows that the agency asked Harkcon whether its \nproposed program manager would be available on site and in accordance with the PWS requirements, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  There is no credible evidence in the record that challenges the veracity of Harkcon\u2019s \nquotation or its responses to the agency\u2019s clarification request.   \n As there has been no showing by AMSG  of a material misrepresentation by Harkcon \nconcerning its proposed program manager , we deny this protest ground.  \n Failure to Propose an Alternate P rogram Manager  \n AMSG also contends that Harkcon failed to propose an alternate program manager ; its \nquotation took exception to the requirement ; and its quotation should have been \ndeclared unacceptable.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 15; Supp. Comments at 13- 14.  \nNNSA responds that the RFQ did not require vendors to identify an alternate program \nmanager in their quotations.  Supp. MOL at 7.  \n Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s requirements, we begin by examining the \nplain language of the solicitation.

We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation \nby reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; \nto be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a \nreading.

Id. \n \nHere, as noted above, the RFQ identified one key personnel position:  program manager.  RFQ at 63.  AMSG  contends that vendors were also required to identify an \nalternate program manager because PWS section 1.5.12, K ey Personnel, provided:  \n \nThe following personnel are considered key personnel by the government: \nProgram Manager.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who \nshall be responsible for the performance of the work.  The name of this person and an alternate who shall act for t he Contractor when the \nmanager is absent shall be designated in writing to the [contracting \nofficer].  The Program Manager or alternate shall have full authority to act  Page 7    B-423290; B -423290.2   for the Contractor on all contract matters relating to daily operation of this \ncontract.  \n Id. at 15.   \n We find the RFQ to be  unambiguous, and we disagree with AMSG \u2019s interpretation that \nvendors were required to identify an alternate program manager  in their quotations .  \nThe RFQ  required vendors to identify a proposed program manager and provide a \nresume for that individual.  Id.  at 63.  The RFQ provided that the agency would evaluate \nthat single resume.  Id.  Neither the RFQ\u2019s submission instructions nor the evaluation \ncriteria referenced an \u201calternate program manager.\u201d  Rather, the PWS established a post-award requirement to identify an alternate program manager during performance.  \nVendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotation submissions.  In sum, nothing in the RFQ required  vendors to identify an alternate \nprogram manager in their quotations; the PWS established a post -award requirement  to \nidentify an alternate program manager .   \n AMSG contends that even if vendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotations, Harkcon took exception to the solicitation\u2019s performance \nrequirements  by including the following statement in its quotation:   \u201cHarkcon\u2019s Program \nManager (PM), backed by Harkcon\u2019s dedicated [Department of Energy]\/NNSA Program Management Office (PMO), will be the singular touch point for all facets of work performed on the contract regardless of the Team Harkcon member\/entity per forming \nthe work.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 13 ( quoting AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Q uotation at 8).  The \nprotester argues that by using the phrase \u201csingular touch point,\u201d Harkcon\u2019s quotation \nforeclosed the possibili ty that any other Harkcon employee could act on the company\u2019s \nbehalf --a violation of the requirement to have an alternate program manager.  Id.   \n \nA proposal or quotation that takes exception to a solicitation\u2019 s material terms and \nconditions should be considered unacceptable and may not form the basis for an award.   \nInnovative Mgmt. & Tech.

Material terms of a solicitation include those which affect the price, quantity, \nquality, or delivery of the goods or services being provided.  Arrington Dixon & As socs., \nInc., B-409981, B -409981.2, Oct. 3, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6  284 at 11.  In determining the \ntechnical acceptability of a proposal or quotation, an agency may not accept at face value a promise to meet a material requirement, where there is significant countervailing evidence that was, or should have been, reasonably known to the agency that should create doubt whether the offeror or vendor will or can comply with that requirement.   \nInnovative Mgmt., supra.  \n Here, we find no basis to sustain AMSG\u2019s protest based on the argument that  Harkcon\u2019 s \nquotation took exception t o the PWS\u2019s requirement to identify an alternate program \nmanager .  The statement  in Harkcon\u2019s quotation that AMSG  identifies does not conflict  \nwith the PWS\u2019s  requirement for the contractor to designate an alternate program \nmanager .  In this respect, we agree with the agency that stating the program manager  Page 8    B-423290; B -423290.2   would serve as the \u201csingular touch point\u201d  for communications with the agency --\nregardless of the entity performing the work --does not mean Harkcon would fail to \nappoint an alternate program manager with full authority to act on the company\u2019s behalf.  \nSupp. MOL at 8.  Furthermore, AMSG does not point to any other language in Harkcon\u2019s quotation to support its assertion that Harkcon took exception to the requirement to designate an alternate program manager.  We deny this protest.  \n Noncompliant CTA \n The protester contends that the awardee was ineligible for award because Har kcon  \ndoes not hold a TEPS III BPA.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments \nat 23- 25.  In this regard and as noted above, Harkcon submitted its quotation as a \nmember of a CTA  relying on MELE\u2019s BPA  as the basis authorizing Harkcon to submit a \nquotation.\n6  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments at 23- 25.  NNSA \nresponds that Harkcon was eligible for award because any CTA member may submit a quotation and lead an order issued under the BPA.   See Supp. MOL at 13; Supp. COS \nat 3; AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2, 4.   \n We have reviewed the record and deny this argument.  The TEPS III BPA ordering guide provides that BPA \u2019s were established with CTA leaders, and both the CTA \nleaders and CTA members have privity of contract with the government  as a result of \nthe CTA members\u2019 FSS contracts .  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 4.  The \nordering guide states:   \n \nThe Government will have privity of contract with each business within the \nteams --allowing the government to engage small businesses directly \nrather than just through the CTA Leader or Order Lead under a standard \nteaming program.  For Task Order awards, the Team Leaders will select \nan Order Lead.  Orders will be issued directly against the Order Lead\u2019s \n[FSS]  contract.  \n Id.  Additionally, the TEPS III BPA ordering guide and MELE\u2019s TEPS III BPA each \nprovide that BPA\u2019s would not be established with CTA members.  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2 (\u201cThe CTA members will not be awarded their own BPA[\u2019]s.\u201d); \n \n6 Additionally, AMSG contends that Harkcon\u2019s quotation was ineligible for award \nbecause Harkcon\u2019s quotation utilized the rates and labor categories from Harkcon\u2019s FSS contract, and those labor categories are absent from the FSS contracts held by MELE and another team member.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 34- 35.  The \nprotester\u2019s allegation appears to be premised on the notion that MELE and the other firm were proposed as CTA members ; and as discussed above, under the FSS program \nprime contractors in their own right .  However, the record establishes that MELE and \nthe other firm were proposed as subcontractors, and the MELE BPA authorized CTA leaders and members to perform as subcontractors.  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; AR, Tab 16 MELE BPA at 6.  Consequently,  there was nothing improper in \nHarkcon using the rates and labor categories from its FSS contract in its quotation.     Page 9    B-423290; B -423290.2   AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 (same).  Furthermore, Harkcon is identified as a team \nmember in MELE\u2019s TEPS III BPA, and the BPA provides that CTA members will be \nissued task orders under their respective FSS contracts when they act as an order leader .  AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 -5.  Accordingly, the protester\u2019s assertion that \nHarkcon was ineligible for award because it is not a BPA holder is contradicted by the TEPS III BPA ordering guid e and the BPA.   \n The protester also claims that even if a CTA member could be eligible for award, \nHarkcon was ineligible because Harkcon did not sign the BPA and therefore did not have privity of contract with the agency.  Protester Supp. Briefing at 3- 4.  We reject this \nargument because sig ning the BPA is irrelevant to the question of privity; a BPA is not a \ncontract.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. v. United States , 741 F.3d 1380, 1382- 83 \n(Fed. Cir.  2014).  Rather, BPA\u2019s  are \u201cframeworks for future contracts --'a set of  grounds \nrules as it were, and no obligations are assumed by either party until orders are given by the Government and accepted by the contractor. \u2019\u201d  Id. at 1381 ( quoting Modern Sys. \nTech. Corp. v. United States , 979 F.2d 200, 204 (Fed. Cir. 1992)) .  It is undisputed that  \nHarkcon holds an  FSS contract, and an FSS contract establishes  privity of contract with \nthe government.   See Roche Diagnostics Corp. , B-419510, B -419510.2, Apr. 16, 2021, \n2021 CPD \u00b6 173 at 5 n.1 (stating members of a CTA are in privity of contract with the government as a result of the members\u2019 FSS contracts).   As such, AMSG\u2019s arguments \nconcerning Harkcon\u2019s alleged failure to sign the BPA are not persuasive.   On this record, we reject the protester\u2019s argument that Harkcon\u2019s quotation was ineligible for award because MELE, the CTA leader, held the BPA instead of Harkcon.        \n \nBest-Value Tradeoff  \n Finally, AMSG challenges the best -value tradeoff decision, complaining the decision \nwas based on a flawed evaluation, and the SSO failed to consider the substantive differences between the vendors\u2019 quotations.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 36- 39; \nSupp. Comments at 2 6-28.  With respect to the latter argument, t he protester \nelaborates:  \u201c the [SSO]  never even acknowledged, much less substantively discussed, \nAMSG \u2019s six more strengths than Harkcon, much less explained why those six strengths, \nindividually and col lectively, do not make AMSG technically superior. \u201d  Comments & \nSupp. Protest at  38.  NNSA replies that the SSO \u201cconsidered the unique attributes of \neach quotation and reached a well -supported best value determination.\u201d  COS\/MOL \nat 22.  \n Where, as here, a procurement conducted pursuant to FAR subpart 8.4 provides for issuance of a task order on a \u201c best-value\u201d  tradeoff basis, it is the function of the source \nselection authority  to perform a price\/technical tradeoff, that is, to determine whether \none quotation\u2019 s technical superiority is worth its higher price.

Even where a \nsolicitation issued under FAR subpart 8.4 emphasizes technical merit over price, an agenc y properly may select a lower -priced, lower -rated quotation if the agency \nreasonably concludes that the price premium involved in selecting a higher -rated,  Page 10    B-423290; B -423290.2   higher -priced quotation is not justified in light of the acceptable level of technical \ncompetence available at a lower price.

The extent to which technical \nsuperiority is traded for a lower price is governed only by the test of rationality and \nconsistency with the stated evaluation criteria.

The award decision included  a detailed discussion of the evaluators\u2019 findings for each \nquotation under each factor.  For example, for the technical narrative\/approach factor, the TEP noted AMSG\u2019s \u201c [DELETED] .\u201d  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award  at 10.  The TEP also \nnoted AMSG\u2019s use of a [DELETED] .  Id.  The award decision includes a similar \ndiscussion  of AMSG\u2019s quotation under the other factors.\n7  Id. at 11.   After discussing the \nevaluation findings for each quotation, the SSO wrote:  \n \nHarkcon\u2019s quotation offered the best value to the government, providing \nthe required services at a $1,247,405.00, or 11.9 [percent], lower price \nthan AMSG while ensuring the same very high probability of successful \nperformance.  While Harkcon\u2019s and AMSG\u2019s quotations each had unique \nattributes under the non- price factors, none of the unique attributes or \nstrengths of AMSG's proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an \nadditional 11.9 [percent] price premium.  \n Id. at 17.    \n \nIn light of the contemporaneous record, we see no basis to conclude that the agency did \nnot adequately consider the technical benefits of AMSG\u2019s quotation.  The SSO made a \nbusiness decision that the advantages in the protester\u2019s quotation did not justify the \nassociated price premium , and the SSO\u2019s reasoning was consistent with the RFQ\u2019s \n \n7 In addition to discussing specific aspects of the vendors\u2019 quotations, the SSO \nconcurred with and adopted the TEP\u2019s assessments of strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies, as well as the adjectival ratings assigned to each quotation.

(AMSG), a service- disabled veteran-\nowned small business (SDVOSB) of Dumfries, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task \norder to Harkcon, Inc., an SDVOSB of Fredericksburg, Virginia, under request for \nquotations (RFQ) No. 89233122QNA000226, issued by the Department of Energy, \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  under the agency\u2019s technical, \nengineering, and programmatic services (TEPS III) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) .  \nThe RFQ sought administrative support services for the Office of Secure Transportation \n(OST).  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of vendors\u2019  \nquotations, as well as the best -value tradeoff decision.    \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order. This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423290; B -423290.2   BACKGROUND  \n \nOn September 4, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, NNSA issued the RFQ to holders of the agency\u2019s TEPS III  BPA.  Agency \nReport (AR), Tab 2, RFQ\n1; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law \n(COS\/MOL) at 3.  The RFQ  sought a contractor to provide administrative support , \nincluding  project and budget analysis, document controls, payroll data entry, travel \nvoucher processing, invoice tracking, purchase request processing, and technical editing and writing.  COS\/MOL at 3.   The RFQ anticipated the issuance of a task order \nwith a 1 -year base period, four 1- year option periods, and a 6- month option to extend \nservices o n a primarily fixed- price basis with a time- and-materials component for travel.   \nRFQ at  13; COS \/MOL  at 4. \n The RFQ provided that the agency intended to issue a task order to the vendor whose quotation represented the best value, considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  technical narrative\/approach, staffing approach, key personnel resume, past performance, and price.  RFQ at 61- 68.  The nonprice factors, \nwhen combined, were significantly more important than price.  Id.  at 61.  The RFQ \nadvised vendors that the agency would not issue a task order \u201cat a price premium it consider s disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated non- price \nsuperiority,\u201d and to the extent quotations were found to be close or similar in merit under the nonprice factors, price was more likely to be determinative.  Id.  at 68.  \n Relevant here, for the key personnel resume factor, vendors were required to provide a resume for the proposed program manager.  RFQ at 63.   The RFQ provided that the \nagency would evaluate the resume to assess whether the individual\u2019s education, \nexperience, and security clearance level demonstrated  the individual\u2019s expertise and \nability to successful ly perform the role in executing the relevant PWS tasks.  Id.   The \nRFQ did not identify any key personnel position other than the program manager.   \n NNSA received four quotations prior to the October 3 submission deadline, and the technical evaluation panel (TEP) determined that  only Harkcon and AMSG submitted \ntechnically acceptable quotations , leaving the other  vendors ineligible for award .\n2  \nCOS\/MOL at 7.   \n \n1 The agency issued two amendments to the RFQ.  Amendment 2, issued on \nSeptember 24, 2024, provided the final version of the performance work statement  \n(PWS) , instructions, and evaluation criteria, and all citations to the RFQ in this decision \nrefer to the version issued with amendment 2.  \n2 As discussed further below, Harkcon submitted a quotation as a member of a \ncontractor teaming arrangement (CTA).  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  A CTA under  the General Services Administration\u2019s  (GSA)  federal \nsupply schedule (FSS)  program  is a written agreement between two or more schedule \ncontractors to work together to meet an agency \u2019s requirements and to maximize a \nvendor \u2019s competitiveness.  See GSA CTA Guidance, \n(continued...)   Page 3    B-423290; B -423290.2   When NNSA evaluated Harkcon\u2019s quotation, the agency sent Harkcon clarification \nquestions concerning its proposed program manager.  First, the agency asked Harkcon to confirm that its proposed program manager would be available on- site at OST \nheadquarters, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  \nLater, NNSA sent Harkcon a second question, noting that Harkcon proposed to capture 100 percent of the incumbent personnel but proposed a Harkcon employee as the program manager .  AR, Tab 9, Second Clarification at 2.  NNSA asked if Harkcon \nintended to capture the incumbent program manager and utilize its proposed program manager.  Id.   Harkcon responded, in relevant part:  \u201cHarkcon is proposing [our \nemployee] as the key person, but could capture the incumbent [program manager] upon award.\u201d  Id.  at 1.   \n The TEP evaluated the quotations submitted by AMSG and Harkcon as follows\n3: \n \n AMSG  Harkcon  \nTechnical\/Narrative Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  \nStaffing Approach  Exceptional  Exceptional  \nKey Personnel Resume  Exceptional  Exceptional  \nPast Performance  Pass  Pass  \nPrice  $11,746,269  $10,498,864  \n COS\/MOL at 8.  \n The contracting officer, who was also the source selection official (SSO) reviewed the TEP\u2019s findings for each quotation.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award at 10- 11, 12- 13.  The \nSSO noted that the quotations submitted by Harkcon and AMSG were equally rated under the nonprice factors, and Harkcon offered a price that was nearly 12 percent \nlower than the price offered by AMSG.  Id. at 17.  The SSO found that each vendor has \n\u201cthe same very high probability of successful performance\u201d and \u201cnone of the unique \n \nwww.gsa.gov\/contractorteamarrangements.  The CTA details the responsibilities of \neach team member.  Id.  CTAs under GSA schedule contracts differ from traditional \nprime contractor -subcontractor arrangements in that:  (1) each team member has privity \nof contract with the government for the goods or services that it is providing, (2) each team member is responsible for its duties laid out in the CTA document, and (3) each team member must have a GSA schedule contract.   Id.; see also Veterans Healthcare \nSupply Sols., Inc. , B-409888, Sept. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 269 at 4.  Here, Harkcon is a \nmember of a CTA, led by MELE Associates, Inc., the TEPS III BPA holder.  See  AR, \nTab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 4; Supp. MOL at 13- 14.  Harkcon does not hold a BPA.    \n3 In evaluating AMSG\u2019s quotation, the agency identified 11 strengths under the technical \nnarrative\/approach factor, six strengths under the staffing approach factor, and four strengths under the key personnel factor.  COS\/MOL at 8.  In evaluating Harkcon\u2019s quotation, the TEP  assigned eight strengths under the technical narrative\/approach \nfactor, four strengths under the staffing approach factor, and three strengths under the key personnel resume factor.  Id.    Page 4    B-423290; B -423290.2   attributes or strengths of AMSG\u2019s proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an \nadditional 11.9 [percent] price premium.\u201d  Id.   The SSO stated that price was the \n\u201cdecisive factor,\u201d and she selected Harkcon\u2019s quotation for award.  Id.   \n On January 13, 2025, NNSA issued the task order to Harkcon.  COS\/MOL at 15.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  The protester challenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of Harkcon\u2019s proposal and the best -value tradeoff decision.  In filing and pursuing this protest, AMSG  \nhas made arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed below.  While we do not address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester \u2019s \narguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest .\n4 \n At the outset, we note w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS contractors \nunder FAR subpart 8.4, we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation \nis reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.

In \nreviewing a protest challenging an agency \u2019s technical evaluation, our Office will not \nreevaluate the quotations; rather, we will examine the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  TSC Enter., LLC , \nB-415731, Feb. 8, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 71 at 2.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the \n \n4 For example, the protester  alleges that the agency treated the offerors unequally by \nassigning Harkcon\u2019s quotation a strength for its approach to travel voucher processing and not assigning AMSG\u2019s quotation a strength for an \u201cidentical feature\u201d -- [DELETED] .  \nComments & Supp. Protest at 25.  Where a protester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the vendors \u2019 quotations .  Cloud All., Inc. , B-422884, Dec. 3, 2024, \n2024 CPD \u00b6  294 at 6.   \nHere, contrary to AMSG\u2019s claims, NNSA assigned a strength to Harkcon\u2019s quotation \nbecause the TEP found that the \u201c approach . . . demonstrate[ d] a commitment to \naccuracy, efficiency, and responsiveness, \u201d and the methodology involved \u201cmeticulous \nverification\u201d and \u201cprompt resolution.\u201d  AR, Tab 11, Harkcon TEP Report  at 4.  The TEP \nwrote:  \u201cThis comprehensive and professional approach enhances the overall travel experience and boosts operational efficiency.\u201d  Id.   The TEP did not assign a strength to \nthe awardee\u2019s quotation because it proposed to [DELETED] --as AMSG claims --and the \nprotester  has not demonstrated that its quotation included the same features as \nHarkcon\u2019s.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.     Page 5    B-423290; B -423290.2   agency \u2019s judgment does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Amyx, \nInc., B-416734.2, Apr. 9, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6  143 at 3.  \n \nAvailability of Proposed Program Manager    \n The protester alleges that Harkcon either misrepresented the availability of its proposed program manager or engaged in a \u201c bait and switch\u201d  scheme, and AMSG asserts that \nNNSA should have found Harkon\u2019s quotation ineligible for award.  Protest at 16.  The protester elaborates  that Harkcon has been recruiting for the position since before \naward, Harkcon attempted to recruit the incumbent program manager, and AMSG \nclaims  the individual Harkcon proposed as its program manager cannot serve as a full -\ntime program  manager because he holds three other positions within the company.  \nComments & Supp. Protest at 8- 12.   \n The issue of whether personnel identified in a vendor \u2019s quotation will, in fact, perform \nunder the subsequently -awarded contract is generally a matter of contract \nadministration that our Office does not review.  DarkStar Intelligence, LLC , B-420609, \nB-420609.2, June 24, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 153 at 6; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5(a).  \nNonetheless, our Office will consider allegations that an offeror proposed personnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to provide during contract performance in order t o obtain a more favorable evaluation, as such a material misrepresentation has \nan adverse effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system.  DarkStar \nIntelligence, supra.   Our decisions refer to such circumstances as a \u201c bait and switch. \u201d  \nId.  To establish an impermissible bait and switch, a protester must show that:  (1) the \nawardee either knowingly or negligently represented that it would rely on specific \npersonnel that it did not have a reasonable basis to expect to furnish during contract performance; (2) the misrepresentation was relied on by the agency; and (3) the \nagency \u2019s reliance had a material effect on the evaluation results.   Id.  \n On this record, we find that AMSG has not established that Harkcon engaged in an impermissible bait and switch.   As an initial matter, we are not persuaded that Harkcon\u2019s \nrecruiting efforts mandate the conclusion that Harkcon proposed a program manager that it did not intend to use.  For one,  as noted above, in its quotation Harkcon proposed \nto capture the incumbent personnel --including the program manager.  AR, Tab 9, \nSecond Clarification at 1- 2.  As such, engagement with the incumbent program \nmanager is c onsistent with Harkcon\u2019s proposed approach and provides no basis to \naccept the protester\u2019s allegation that Harkcon made a misrepresentation.\n5  DarkStar \nIntelligence, supra.          \n \n \n5 Additionally, our Office has found that the mere fact that an awardee recruited \nincumbent personnel  after award does not establish that the proposed personnel are \nunavailable to perform ; it is neither unusual nor inherently improper for an awardee to \nrecruit and hire personnel previously employed by an incumbent contractor.

Page 6    B-423290; B -423290.2   In addition, while AMSG has provided our Office with a Harkcon job posting seeking a \nproject manager to support a Department of Energy contract, evidence of recruitment \nefforts does not establish a knowing or negligent representation by Harkcon that it planned to rely on a specific program manager that it did not expect to furnish during performance.  See ICF Inc., L.L.C. , B-419049.3, B -419049.4, Mar ch 9, 2021, 2021 CPD \n\u00b6 117 at 8- 9.  Accordingly, the protester  has not provided any reasonable evidence to \nsupport its misrepresentation allegations.   We are also not persuaded by AMSG\u2019s argument that the proposed program manager \nis unavailable to perform because he holds other positions within Harkcon.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8- 9.  The record shows that the agency asked Harkcon whether its \nproposed program manager would be available on site and in accordance with the PWS requirements, and Harkcon responded affirmatively.  AR, Tab 8, First Clarification at 1.  There is no credible evidence in the record that challenges the veracity of Harkcon\u2019s \nquotation or its responses to the agency\u2019s clarification request.   \n As there has been no showing by AMSG  of a material misrepresentation by Harkcon \nconcerning its proposed program manager , we deny this protest ground.  \n Failure to Propose an Alternate P rogram Manager  \n AMSG also contends that Harkcon failed to propose an alternate program manager ; its \nquotation took exception to the requirement ; and its quotation should have been \ndeclared unacceptable.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 15; Supp. Comments at 13- 14.  \nNNSA responds that the RFQ did not require vendors to identify an alternate program \nmanager in their quotations.  Supp. MOL at 7.  \n Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s requirements, we begin by examining the \nplain language of the solicitation.

We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation \nby reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; \nto be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a \nreading.  Desbuild Inc. , B\u2011413613.2, Jan. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 23 at 5.  If the \nsolicitation language is unambiguous our inquiry ceases .  Id. \n \nHere, as noted above, the RFQ identified one key personnel position:  program manager.  RFQ at 63.  AMSG  contends that vendors were also required to identify an \nalternate program manager because PWS section 1.5.12, K ey Personnel, provided:  \n \nThe following personnel are considered key personnel by the government: \nProgram Manager.  The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager who \nshall be responsible for the performance of the work.  The name of this person and an alternate who shall act for t he Contractor when the \nmanager is absent shall be designated in writing to the [contracting \nofficer].  The Program Manager or alternate shall have full authority to act  Page 7    B-423290; B -423290.2   for the Contractor on all contract matters relating to daily operation of this \ncontract.  \n Id. at 15.   \n We find the RFQ to be  unambiguous, and we disagree with AMSG \u2019s interpretation that \nvendors were required to identify an alternate program manager  in their quotations .  \nThe RFQ  required vendors to identify a proposed program manager and provide a \nresume for that individual.  Id.  at 63.  The RFQ provided that the agency would evaluate \nthat single resume.  Id.  Neither the RFQ\u2019s submission instructions nor the evaluation \ncriteria referenced an \u201calternate program manager.\u201d  Rather, the PWS established a post-award requirement to identify an alternate program manager during performance.  \nVendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotation submissions.  In sum, nothing in the RFQ required  vendors to identify an alternate \nprogram manager in their quotations; the PWS established a post -award requirement  to \nidentify an alternate program manager .   \n AMSG contends that even if vendors were not required to identify an alternate program manager in their quotations, Harkcon took exception to the solicitation\u2019s performance \nrequirements  by including the following statement in its quotation:   \u201cHarkcon\u2019s Program \nManager (PM), backed by Harkcon\u2019s dedicated [Department of Energy]\/NNSA Program Management Office (PMO), will be the singular touch point for all facets of work performed on the contract regardless of the Team Harkcon member\/entity per forming \nthe work.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 13 ( quoting AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Q uotation at 8).  The \nprotester argues that by using the phrase \u201csingular touch point,\u201d Harkcon\u2019s quotation \nforeclosed the possibili ty that any other Harkcon employee could act on the company\u2019s \nbehalf --a violation of the requirement to have an alternate program manager.  Id.   \n \nA proposal or quotation that takes exception to a solicitation\u2019 s material terms and \nconditions should be considered unacceptable and may not form the basis for an award.   \nInnovative Mgmt. & Tech.

In determining the \ntechnical acceptability of a proposal or quotation, an agency may not accept at face value a promise to meet a material requirement, where there is significant countervailing evidence that was, or should have been, reasonably known to the agency that should create doubt whether the offeror or vendor will or can comply with that requirement.   \nInnovative Mgmt., supra.  \n Here, we find no basis to sustain AMSG\u2019s protest based on the argument that  Harkcon\u2019 s \nquotation took exception t o the PWS\u2019s requirement to identify an alternate program \nmanager .  The statement  in Harkcon\u2019s quotation that AMSG  identifies does not conflict  \nwith the PWS\u2019s  requirement for the contractor to designate an alternate program \nmanager .  In this respect, we agree with the agency that stating the program manager  Page 8    B-423290; B -423290.2   would serve as the \u201csingular touch point\u201d  for communications with the agency --\nregardless of the entity performing the work --does not mean Harkcon would fail to \nappoint an alternate program manager with full authority to act on the company\u2019s behalf.  \nSupp. MOL at 8.  Furthermore, AMSG does not point to any other language in Harkcon\u2019s quotation to support its assertion that Harkcon took exception to the requirement to designate an alternate program manager.  We deny this protest.  \n Noncompliant CTA \n The protester contends that the awardee was ineligible for award because Har kcon  \ndoes not hold a TEPS III BPA.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments \nat 23- 25.  In this regard and as noted above, Harkcon submitted its quotation as a \nmember of a CTA  relying on MELE\u2019s BPA  as the basis authorizing Harkcon to submit a \nquotation.\n6  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35- 36; Supp. Comments at 23- 25.  NNSA \nresponds that Harkcon was eligible for award because any CTA member may submit a quotation and lead an order issued under the BPA.   See Supp. MOL at 13; Supp. COS \nat 3; AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2, 4.   \n We have reviewed the record and deny this argument.  The TEPS III BPA ordering guide provides that BPA \u2019s were established with CTA leaders, and both the CTA \nleaders and CTA members have privity of contract with the government  as a result of \nthe CTA members\u2019 FSS contracts .  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 4.  The \nordering guide states:   \n \nThe Government will have privity of contract with each business within the \nteams --allowing the government to engage small businesses directly \nrather than just through the CTA Leader or Order Lead under a standard \nteaming program.  For Task Order awards, the Team Leaders will select \nan Order Lead.  Orders will be issued directly against the Order Lead\u2019s \n[FSS]  contract.  \n Id.  Additionally, the TEPS III BPA ordering guide and MELE\u2019s TEPS III BPA each \nprovide that BPA\u2019s would not be established with CTA members.  AR, Tab 17, TEPS III BPA Ordering Guide at 2 (\u201cThe CTA members will not be awarded their own BPA[\u2019]s.\u201d); \n \n6 Additionally, AMSG contends that Harkcon\u2019s quotation was ineligible for award \nbecause Harkcon\u2019s quotation utilized the rates and labor categories from Harkcon\u2019s FSS contract, and those labor categories are absent from the FSS contracts held by MELE and another team member.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 34- 35.  The \nprotester\u2019s allegation appears to be premised on the notion that MELE and the other firm were proposed as CTA members ; and as discussed above, under the FSS program \nprime contractors in their own right .  However, the record establishes that MELE and \nthe other firm were proposed as subcontractors, and the MELE BPA authorized CTA leaders and members to perform as subcontractors.  AR, Tab 6, Harkcon Quotation at 36; AR, Tab 16 MELE BPA at 6.  Consequently,  there was nothing improper in \nHarkcon using the rates and labor categories from its FSS contract in its quotation.     Page 9    B-423290; B -423290.2   AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 (same).  Furthermore, Harkcon is identified as a team \nmember in MELE\u2019s TEPS III BPA, and the BPA provides that CTA members will be \nissued task orders under their respective FSS contracts when they act as an order leader .  AR, Tab 16, MELE BPA at 4 -5.  Accordingly, the protester\u2019s assertion that \nHarkcon was ineligible for award because it is not a BPA holder is contradicted by the TEPS III BPA ordering guid e and the BPA.   \n The protester also claims that even if a CTA member could be eligible for award, \nHarkcon was ineligible because Harkcon did not sign the BPA and therefore did not have privity of contract with the agency.  Protester Supp. Briefing at 3- 4.  We reject this \nargument because sig ning the BPA is irrelevant to the question of privity; a BPA is not a \ncontract.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. v. United States , 741 F.3d 1380, 1382- 83 \n(Fed. Cir.  2014).  Rather, BPA\u2019s  are \u201cframeworks for future contracts --'a set of  grounds \nrules as it were, and no obligations are assumed by either party until orders are given by the Government and accepted by the contractor. \u2019\u201d  Id. at 1381 ( quoting Modern Sys. \nTech. Corp. v. United States , 979 F.2d 200, 204 (Fed. Cir. 1992)) .  It is undisputed that  \nHarkcon holds an  FSS contract, and an FSS contract establishes  privity of contract with \nthe government.   See Roche Diagnostics Corp. , B-419510, B -419510.2, Apr. 16, 2021, \n2021 CPD \u00b6 173 at 5 n.1 (stating members of a CTA are in privity of contract with the government as a result of the members\u2019 FSS contracts).   As such, AMSG\u2019s arguments \nconcerning Harkcon\u2019s alleged failure to sign the BPA are not persuasive.   On this record, we reject the protester\u2019s argument that Harkcon\u2019s quotation was ineligible for award because MELE, the CTA leader, held the BPA instead of Harkcon.        \n \nBest-Value Tradeoff  \n Finally, AMSG challenges the best -value tradeoff decision, complaining the decision \nwas based on a flawed evaluation, and the SSO failed to consider the substantive differences between the vendors\u2019 quotations.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 36- 39; \nSupp. Comments at 2 6-28.  With respect to the latter argument, t he protester \nelaborates:  \u201c the [SSO]  never even acknowledged, much less substantively discussed, \nAMSG \u2019s six more strengths than Harkcon, much less explained why those six strengths, \nindividually and col lectively, do not make AMSG technically superior. \u201d  Comments & \nSupp. Protest at  38.

Even where a \nsolicitation issued under FAR subpart 8.4 emphasizes technical merit over price, an agenc y properly may select a lower -priced, lower -rated quotation if the agency \nreasonably concludes that the price premium involved in selecting a higher -rated,  Page 10    B-423290; B -423290.2   higher -priced quotation is not justified in light of the acceptable level of technical \ncompetence available at a lower price.

Rather, the documentation need only be sufficient to establish \nthat the agency was aware of the relative merits and costs of the competing quotations and that the source selection was reasonably based.

The award decision included  a detailed discussion of the evaluators\u2019 findings for each \nquotation under each factor.  For example, for the technical narrative\/approach factor, the TEP noted AMSG\u2019s \u201c [DELETED] .\u201d  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award  at 10.  The TEP also \nnoted AMSG\u2019s use of a [DELETED] .  Id.  The award decision includes a similar \ndiscussion  of AMSG\u2019s quotation under the other factors.\n7  Id. at 11.   After discussing the \nevaluation findings for each quotation, the SSO wrote:  \n \nHarkcon\u2019s quotation offered the best value to the government, providing \nthe required services at a $1,247,405.00, or 11.9 [percent], lower price \nthan AMSG while ensuring the same very high probability of successful \nperformance.  While Harkcon\u2019s and AMSG\u2019s quotations each had unique \nattributes under the non- price factors, none of the unique attributes or \nstrengths of AMSG's proposal (individually, or combined) would justify an \nadditional 11.9 [percent] price premium.  \n Id. at 17.    \n \nIn light of the contemporaneous record, we see no basis to conclude that the agency did \nnot adequately consider the technical benefits of AMSG\u2019s quotation.  The SSO made a \nbusiness decision that the advantages in the protester\u2019s quotation did not justify the \nassociated price premium , and the SSO\u2019s reasoning was consistent with the RFQ\u2019s \n \n7 In addition to discussing specific aspects of the vendors\u2019 quotations, the SSO \nconcurred with and adopted the TEP\u2019s assessments of strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies, as well as the adjectival ratings assigned to each quotation.

O ur \nOffice has consistently concluded that a source selection official may reasonably select \na lower priced, lower technically rated quotation, even where price is the least important  \nfacto r.  Spatial Front, supra; Booz Allen Hamilton, supra.  Here, the protester simply \ndisagrees with the agency \u2019s business judgment, and such disagreement provides no \nbasis to sustain the protest.8 \n The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n \n8 To the extent the protester asserts that the SSO was required to specifically address \neach strength that the TEP identified in the vendors\u2019 quotations, the argument lacks merit because a procuring agency is not required to document every consideration that factored into the tradeoff decision.  Alethix LLC, supra.  Here, the SSO discussed several of the strengths identified in each quotation, and the SSO stated that she independently reviewed and adopted the TEP\u2019s findings.  AR, Tab 15, Basis of Award at 10.  In this regard, we have no basis to object to the agency \u2019s tradeoff determination.  "

The solicitation provided for award on a best -value tradeoff \nbasis, considering the following three evaluation factors:  technical, past performance, \nand price.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFP at 66.  The technical evaluation factor \nconsisted of four subfactors:  staffing plan; security clearances; mission essential \nservices plan; and quality control plan.  Each subfactor included multiple elements that \nofferors were required to address.  T he staffing plan subfactor was composed of four \nelements, including, as relevant here:  \n \n(d) a description of how the offeror intends to maintain uninterrupted \nservice during the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or \nother sustained leave to ensure no degradation to continued services.   \n \nAR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4.  \n \nThe RFP explained the evaluation and award selection process as follows.   \nFirst, the agency would perform a compliance check to ensure that the proposal \ncomplied with all solicitation instructions.  Id. at 8.  Second, the agency would rank all \ncompliant proposals in order of  price .  Id.  Third, starting with the lowest -\npriced proposal, the agency would evaluate the technical proposals under the technical \nfactor on an acceptable\/unacceptable basis, until two or more quotations were found to \nbe technically acceptable.   Id.  A proposal that was evaluated as unacceptable under \nany element of a subfactor was rated as unacceptable for that subfactor.  A proposal \nthat was rated unacceptable under any technical subfactor was rated unacceptable \nunder the technical factor.  Id.   Fourth, the agency would evaluate the technically \nacceptable proposals under the past performance factor until at least one proposal was \nrated substantial confidence for past performance or until all technically acceptable \nproposals were evaluated for past performance. 2  Id.  Finally, o nce the g overnment \nevaluated a proposal as technically acceptable with a substantial confidence rating for \npast performance or completed evaluations of all responsive proposals, the g overnment \nwould conduct a best -value tradeoff analysis  based on those proposals determined to \nbe technically acceptable consider ing the past performance rating and price.

The \nagency evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal for technical acceptability and found that it was unacceptable under both the staffing plan and mission essential services plan \nsubfactors.  AR, Tab 38, SSEB Report  at 22, 24.  The proposal was therefore evaluated \nas unacceptable under the technical factor and eliminated from the competition.  Id.  \nat 26.   On February 18, SysCom timely filed its protest.       \n \n2 The potential past performance ratings were substantial confidence, satisfactory \nconfidence, neutral confidence, limited confidence, and no confidence.

Page 3 B-423334   \nDISCUSSION  SysCom protests that the agency unreasonably evaluated its technical proposal under the staffing plan and mission essential services subfactors.  SysCom also asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate its past performance and unreasonably evaluated its price.  The agency maintains that it reasonably evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal in accordance with the solicitation.  As discussed below, we deny the protest.  \n Staffing Plan  \n Under the staffing plan subfactor offerors were required to address four elements, including a description of how the offeror intends to maintain uninterrupted service in the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave to ensure no degradation in services.  AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4.  \nSysCom\u2019s proposal was rated unacceptable under this element because the agency concluded that SysCom\u2019s proposal  did not describe how services would be maintained \nin the event of short term leave due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave, as required.  AR, Tab 38, SSEB Report at 22.  Specifically, the SSE B concluded: \n \nA review of the offerors proposal includes a description of their use of a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) which largely focuses on the need to maintain mission essential services.  Here, the offeror addresses circumstances such as incidents of disaster and risk mitigation; however, the offeror does not expressly discuss matters of individual personnel \nillness or injury, vacation or other forms of sustained leave.  As the \nofferor\u2019s proposal fails to address these matters, this leaves the evaluators to assume that incidents such as those described in the COOP could \napply to other incidents or life events to ensure maintaining uninterrupted \nservices, but this is unclear.  Given this information as written, the offeror\u2019s \nproposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.  \n Id. at 22.    \n SysCom protests that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  SysCom specifically assert s that the agency failed to consider relevant information in its \nproposal.  \n \nIn reviewing a protest challenging an agency \u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office will \nnot re- evaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency.   Kiewit  \nInfrastructure  West  Co., B-415421,  B-415421.2,  Dec. 28, 2017,  2018 CPD \u00b6 55 at 5. \nThe evaluation of proposals is generally a matter within the agency \u2019s discretion.  \nId.  Our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s judgment  was \nreasonable and in accord with the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP.   Id.  A \nprotester \u2019s disagreement with the agency \u2019s evaluation, without more, does not establish \nthat the evaluation was unreasonabl e.  REEL  COH Inc., B-418095,  B-418095.2,   Page 4 B-423334  Jan. 10, 2020,  2020 CPD \u00b6 55 at 8.  We have reviewed the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nSysCom\u2019s proposal with respect to maintaining uninterrupted service in the absence of \npersonnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave and conclude that it was reasonable.  \n SysCom argues that its proposal included several examples of plans to maintain uninterrupted service during the absence of personnel for any reason, which included \nplans to fill open positions and cover unexpected openings as well as to identify candidates to fill unexpected openings.  SysCom specifically notes that its proposal \nprovided that it would [DELETED] .  SysCom further asserts that in its proposal, it noted \n[DELETED] .  Finally, SysCom  states that it noted that it would [DELETED], and that it \nincluded a list on [DELETED].     \n  These strategies, as the agency points out, concern filling open positions and vacancies, not dealing with short term absences that occur because of illness or vacation.  COS at 8.  In fact, SysCom does not dispute that its proposal did not specifically address how it planned to maintain uninterrupted services that resulted from \nabsences due to illness or vacation.  Comments at 2- 3.  Rather, SysCom contends that \nit provided plans to address any \u201cother sustained leave\u201d and that this was sufficient to meet th e solicitation requirements.  See id.   Because the protester\u2019s proposal  did not \naddress how it would cover services in case of absence for vacations and sickness, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated SysCom\u2019s  staffing plan, and as a result its \nproposal,  as unacceptable.  \n \nIn its comments submitted in response to the agency report , SysCom asserts that the \nsolicitation instructed offerors to provide a plan to address how they would \u201c maintain \nuninterrupted service during the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or  \nother sustained leave to ensure no degradation to continued services.\u201d   Comments at 2 -\n3; AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4 .  The protester argues that use \nof the word \u201c or\u201d indicated that offerors were not required to provide plans for an \nexhaustive list of absence types.  That is, according to the protester, if the agency \nwanted the protester to address all types of absence, including those stemming from vacations and illness,  it should have instructed offerors to provide a plan for absences \ndue to \u201c sickness, vacations, and other sustained leave.\u201d   Id. at 3.  SysCom concludes \nthat the solicitation therefore did not require offerors to address each category of potential absence.   \n \nThis basis of protest is untimely.  O ur Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the \ntimely submission of protests.  These timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of \ngiving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without disrupting or delaying the procurement process.

Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged improprieties in a \nsolicitation must generally be filed no later than 10 days after the protester knew or should have known of the basis for protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  Where a protester  Page 5 B-423334  initially files a timely protest, and later supplements it with independent grounds of \nprotest, the later -raised allegations must independently satisfy the timeliness \nrequirements, since our Regulations do not contemplate the unwarranted piecemeal  \npresentation or development of protest issues.

The evaluators \nconcluded the proposal failed to discuss matters of individual personnel illness or injury, vacation or other forms of sustained leave with adequate clarity to make an informed determination of technical acceptability.   \n Protest, exh. D, D ebriefing at 19.  \n SysCom knew from the debriefing, which was provided on February  11, 2025, and \ntherefore knew when it filed its initial protest, that the agency evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal as unacceptable because it did not address how it intended to deal with \nabsences due to illness or vacation.  SysCom\u2019s protest  that the solicitation did not \nrequire it to provide a plan to deal with absences due to illness or vacation, raised for \nthe first time in its comments submitted on March 31, is therefore untimely  as it \nrepresents a piecemeal presentation of the protest issue that could have been raised in \nthe initial protest .     \n \nSince the agency reasonably evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal under the staffing plan \nfactor as unacceptable, SysCom is not eligible for award.  SysCom therefore is not an interested party to pursue its other challenge s to the evaluation of its proposal under the \nmission essential services plan subfactor, the past performance factor, or the price  \nfactor .

SysCom also asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate its past performance and unreasonably evaluated its price.  The agency maintains that it reasonably evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal in accordance with the solicitation.  As discussed below, we deny the protest.  \n Staffing Plan  \n Under the staffing plan subfactor offerors were required to address four elements, including a description of how the offeror intends to maintain uninterrupted service in the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave to ensure no degradation in services.  AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4.  \nSysCom\u2019s proposal was rated unacceptable under this element because the agency concluded that SysCom\u2019s proposal  did not describe how services would be maintained \nin the event of short term leave due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave, as required.  AR, Tab 38, SSEB Report at 22.  Specifically, the SSE B concluded: \n \nA review of the offerors proposal includes a description of their use of a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) which largely focuses on the need to maintain mission essential services.  Here, the offeror addresses circumstances such as incidents of disaster and risk mitigation; however, the offeror does not expressly discuss matters of individual personnel \nillness or injury, vacation or other forms of sustained leave.  As the \nofferor\u2019s proposal fails to address these matters, this leaves the evaluators to assume that incidents such as those described in the COOP could \napply to other incidents or life events to ensure maintaining uninterrupted \nservices, but this is unclear.  Given this information as written, the offeror\u2019s \nproposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.  \n Id. at 22.    \n SysCom protests that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  SysCom specifically assert s that the agency failed to consider relevant information in its \nproposal.  \n \nIn reviewing a protest challenging an agency \u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office will \nnot re- evaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency.   Kiewit  \nInfrastructure  West  Co., B-415421,  B-415421.2,  Dec. 28, 2017,  2018 CPD \u00b6 55 at 5. \nThe evaluation of proposals is generally a matter within the agency \u2019s discretion.  \nId.  Our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s judgment  was \nreasonable and in accord with the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP.   Id.  A \nprotester \u2019s disagreement with the agency \u2019s evaluation, without more, does not establish \nthat the evaluation was unreasonabl e.  REEL  COH Inc., B-418095,  B-418095.2,   Page 4 B-423334  Jan. 10, 2020,  2020 CPD \u00b6 55 at 8.  We have reviewed the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nSysCom\u2019s proposal with respect to maintaining uninterrupted service in the absence of \npersonnel due to sickness, vacations, or other sustained leave and conclude that it was reasonable.  \n SysCom argues that its proposal included several examples of plans to maintain uninterrupted service during the absence of personnel for any reason, which included \nplans to fill open positions and cover unexpected openings as well as to identify candidates to fill unexpected openings.  SysCom specifically notes that its proposal \nprovided that it would [DELETED] .  SysCom further asserts that in its proposal, it noted \n[DELETED] .  Finally, SysCom  states that it noted that it would [DELETED], and that it \nincluded a list on [DELETED].     \n  These strategies, as the agency points out, concern filling open positions and vacancies, not dealing with short term absences that occur because of illness or vacation.  COS at 8.  In fact, SysCom does not dispute that its proposal did not specifically address how it planned to maintain uninterrupted services that resulted from \nabsences due to illness or vacation.  Comments at 2- 3.  Rather, SysCom contends that \nit provided plans to address any \u201cother sustained leave\u201d and that this was sufficient to meet th e solicitation requirements.  See id.   Because the protester\u2019s proposal  did not \naddress how it would cover services in case of absence for vacations and sickness, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated SysCom\u2019s  staffing plan, and as a result its \nproposal,  as unacceptable.  \n \nIn its comments submitted in response to the agency report , SysCom asserts that the \nsolicitation instructed offerors to provide a plan to address how they would \u201c maintain \nuninterrupted service during the absence of personnel due to sickness, vacations, or  \nother sustained leave to ensure no degradation to continued services.\u201d   Comments at 2 -\n3; AR, Tab 23, RFP, a mend. 2, Evaluation Factors at 4 .  The protester argues that use \nof the word \u201c or\u201d indicated that offerors were not required to provide plans for an \nexhaustive list of absence types.  That is, according to the protester, if the agency \nwanted the protester to address all types of absence, including those stemming from vacations and illness,  it should have instructed offerors to provide a plan for absences \ndue to \u201c sickness, vacations, and other sustained leave.\u201d   Id. at 3.  SysCom concludes \nthat the solicitation therefore did not require offerors to address each category of potential absence.   \n \nThis basis of protest is untimely.  O ur Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the \ntimely submission of protests.  These timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of \ngiving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without disrupting or delaying the procurement process.

Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged improprieties in a \nsolicitation must generally be filed no later than 10 days after the protester knew or should have known of the basis for protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  Where a protester  Page 5 B-423334  initially files a timely protest, and later supplements it with independent grounds of \nprotest, the later -raised allegations must independently satisfy the timeliness \nrequirements, since our Regulations do not contemplate the unwarranted piecemeal  \npresentation or development of protest issues.

The evaluators \nconcluded the proposal failed to discuss matters of individual personnel illness or injury, vacation or other forms of sustained leave with adequate clarity to make an informed determination of technical acceptability.   \n Protest, exh. D, D ebriefing at 19.  \n SysCom knew from the debriefing, which was provided on February  11, 2025, and \ntherefore knew when it filed its initial protest, that the agency evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal as unacceptable because it did not address how it intended to deal with \nabsences due to illness or vacation.  SysCom\u2019s protest  that the solicitation did not \nrequire it to provide a plan to deal with absences due to illness or vacation, raised for \nthe first time in its comments submitted on March 31, is therefore untimely  as it \nrepresents a piecemeal presentation of the protest issue that could have been raised in \nthe initial protest .     \n \nSince the agency reasonably evaluated SysCom\u2019s proposal under the staffing plan \nfactor as unacceptable, SysCom is not eligible for award.  SysCom therefore is not an interested party to pursue its other challenge s to the evaluation of its proposal under the \nmission essential services plan subfactor, the past performance factor, or the price  \nfactor .

The protester contends that the agency should \nhave considered its late proposal because the delay in submission was due to a system \nfailure of the agency \u2019s web -based tool designated for electronic submission of \nproposals.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the solicitation on December 23, 2024, to holders of the Navy\u2019s  \nSeaport  Next Generation ( NxG) multiple -award, indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity \n(IDIQ) c ontract , pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.

Agency Report (AR), a ttach. 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation sought proposals to \nprovide engineering and t echnical services and deliverables for cargo and weapons \nhandling and stowage systems , as well as  aircraft launch and r ecovery systems.   Id. \nat 5, 8; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 2.   The \nRFP, issued as a small business set -aside,  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-\nfixed -fee task order with a 1 -year base period and four 1- year option periods .

As relevant here, the provision provides that \nproposals not received by the contracting officer and contract specialist by the exact \ntime specified would be \u201c late\u201d and would not be evaluated unless the proposal  is \nreceived before award is made, the contracting officer determines that accepting the \nlate offer would not unduly delay the acquisition, and one of three exceptions applies.\n3  \nFAR provision 52.215- 1(c)(3)(ii)(A)(1 -3).   \n \n1 Citations to the record are to the documents \u2019 Adobe PDF pagination.

AR, attach. 7, Memorandum for Record, Mar. 3, 2025,  at 11.   \n After review, the Navy determined that LPI\u2019s proposal was untimely and therefore must be rejected.  Id.  The Navy notified LPI on February 28, 2025, that its proposal was \nreceived late and thus would not be considered for award.   Id.; COS\/MOL at 5.   On \nMarch 10, LPI filed th e instant  protest with our Office.\n5 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nLPI argues that the Navy unreasonably rejected its proposal as late because LPI\u2019s late \nsubmission was the fault of the agency.  Protest at 5.  In the protester\u2019s view, \nfunctionality issues with the agency\u2019s SeaPort -NxG portal prevented LPI from submitting \nits proposal prior to the 5:00 p.m. deadline on the date proposals were due.  Id.  In this \nregard, the protester explains that it attempted to submit its proposal approximately \n30 minutes before the deadline, but that the SeaPort -NxG portal \u201cfroze\u201d three times --\nonce roughly five minutes before the 5:00 p.m. deadline and two more times after several re- login attempts --preventing LPI from completing its proposal submission via \nthe por tal prior to the deadline.

Page 4    B-423379   Contracts Specialist at 3.  According to the protester, the late submission of its proposal \nshould be excused because the delay resulted from  \u201cfunctionality issues\u201d with the \nagency\u2019s portal and that \u201c[i]t is entirely unreasonable to expect LPI to submit a proposal when the required means by which to do so is malfunctioning completely\u201d and that the government \u201cmust afford all eligible responsible vendors  . . . a reasonable opportunity to \ncompete.\u201d\n 6  Protest at 6. \n The agency asserts that the protester failed to submit its proposal before the submission deadline  and that the contracting officer \u2019s decision not to consider the \nprotester \u2019s proposal was reasonable and in accordance with solicitation requirements \nand FAR provision 52.215- 1.  COS\/MOL at 6 -11.  Based on the record before us, we \nagree with the agency and find no basis to question its decision to reject LPI\u2019s proposal as late.  \n It is an offeror\u2019s responsibility to deliver its proposal to the proper place at the proper time.

Moreover, FAR provision 52.215- 1, which was incorporated into the RFP \nbe reference,  provides  in part, that proposals not received by the contracting officer by \nthe exact time specified would be \u201clate\u201d and would not be evaluated.

LPI neither refuted the agency\u2019s response nor did it pursue this \nallegation in its comments to the agency report.  See  Comments.   Where, as here, an \nagency provides a detailed response to a protester \u2019s assertion and the protester fails to \nrebut the agency \u2019s arguments in its comments, the protester fails to provide us with a \nbasis to conclude that the agency \u2019s position with respect to the issue in question is \nunreasonable.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.3(i)(3); Medical Staffing Sols.

Here, the protester concedes \nthat it did not submit a complete copy of its  proposal via the Seaport -NxG portal by the \n5:00 p.m. deadline.  Protest at 5 ( The protester\u2019s representative \u201cwas unable to \ncomplete the submission by the 5:00 PM deadline. \u201d).  In addition, LPI did not contact the \nSeaPort -NxG helpdesk to register a help ticket to report system issues or notify the \ncognizant contracting officer prior to the 5:00 p.m. February 14, 2025, closing time and date.  COS\/MOL at 3, n. 2.  \n As noted above, LPI  argues that the late submission of its proposal should be excused \nbecause,  according to the protester, the delay was the result of problems with the \nnormal operation of the SeaPort -NxG portal .  To investigate the facts related to \nprotester \u2019s allegations and its attempts to submit its proposal, the SeaPort program \nmanagement office, which is charged with maintaining the operation of the SeaPort \nelectronic portal and administration of the SeaPort -NxG system, conducted an audit that \nrevealed the portal was functioning properly on the date of submissions.  AR, a ttach. 3, \nDeclaration of SeaPort System Project Manager at 2 .  Specifically, the audit revealed \nthat there were \u201cno service tickets or calls from offerors for February 13[th] [or]  14th,\u201d \nincluding no service tickets or calls from LPI, \u201c reporting functionality issues. \u201d  COS\/MOL \nat 6-7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  The audit  also found that another \nofferor \u201csuccessfully uploaded its proposal into the Seaport portal at 3:59 p.m. EDT\u201d on February 14--\u201c40 minutes before LPI started its submission--with no issues reported by\u201d that offeror.  COS\/MOL at 7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  In addition, t he \nrecord reflects that the Navy also received proposals without issue from three other \nofferors via the SeaPort -NxG portal on February  13.  COS\/MOL at 3 -4; AR, a ttach . 9, \nTime Stamped Proposals  at 25.  The record also shows that several subcontractors \nwere able to upload documents into the portal from February 12 through February 14, \nwithout incident.  COS\/MOL at 4; AR, a ttach. 9,  Time Stamped Proposals  at 25. \n Based on the record before us, LPI  has not demonstrated that a disruption to the normal \nprocesses of the SeaPort -NxG portal occurred during the pertinent timeframe .  See \nProtest at 5 -7; Comments at 1 -3.  Although LPI points to an issue it experienced viewing \na solicitation amendment in the portal on February 11, 2025 --three days prior to the \nproposal due date--which the protester reported to the portal help desk, Navy  \nrepresentatives have confirmed the operability of the SeaPort -NxG portal  during the \nperiod in question as normal .  As noted above, the Navy \u2019s audit found that  there were \nno service tickets or calls from offerors reporting functionality issues on February 13 or 14, and that another offeror successfully submitted a timely proposal via  the SeaPort -\nNxG portal  at 3:59 p.m. on February 14, one hour before the proposal deadline.  \nCOS\/MOL at 7.  Further, as pointed out by the agency, even assuming that there w ere \nperiodic glitches in the SeaPort -NxG portal, the occasional malfunctioning of an on- line \nportal does  not rise to the level of systemic failure.   Id. at 9 (citing  Federal Acquisition \nServs. Team , LLC, B -410466, Dec. 31, 2014, 2015 CPD \u00b6 20 at 4) .  On these facts, \nthere is no basis to conclude that the SeaPort -NxG portal  experienced a system failure \nduring the period in question and LPI has not  otherwise  demonstrated government fault .  Page 6    B-423379   Finally, to the extent LPI alleges that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to \ncompete, the record reflects that all offerors, including LPI, were provided ample time to submit proposals and were on notice that late proposals --i.e., proposals not submitted \nthrough the SeaPort -NxG portal by the solicitation closing date and time of 5:00 p.m. on \nFebruary 14--would be rejected as unacceptable in accordance with the solicitation and FAR provision 52.215- 1.  RFP at 2, 95.  The record shows that the Navy \u2019s exclusion of \nLPI\u2019s proposal as late is consistent with the terms of the solicitation  and FAR provision \n52.215- 1.

This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423379   part 16.  Agency Report (AR), a ttach. 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation sought proposals to \nprovide engineering and t echnical services and deliverables for cargo and weapons \nhandling and stowage systems , as well as  aircraft launch and r ecovery systems.   Id. \nat 5, 8; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 2.   The \nRFP, issued as a small business set -aside,  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-\nfixed -fee task order with a 1 -year base period and four 1- year option periods .  RFP at 5. \n \nThe solicitation required proposals to be submitted electronically through the SeaPort -\nNxG portal.  Id.  at 95.  Proposals were due by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)  \non February 14, 2025.2  Id. at 2; COS\/MOL at 3.  As relevant here, the RFP provided \nthat, \u201cin order to be considered for award,\u201d \u201c[p]roposals shall be submitted through the \nSeaPort -NxG portal by the solicitation closing date and time.\u201d  RFP at 95.  The \nsolicitation specified that \u201c[i]t is not permissible to upload a link to an internet -based data \ncenter ( e.g. Google cloud or Dropbox),\u201d but that offerors \u201cshall submit all required \nproposal information as files uploaded directly in the SeaPort -NxG portal.\u201d  Id.   The RFP \ncautioned that, \u201c[i]n the rare event the portal is down or inaccessible, [the] Offeror shall \nimmediately notify the cognizant Contracting Officer for the solicitation via email prior to the solicitation closing date and time. \u201d  Id.  In this regard, the solicitation also required \nthat the offeror \u201c contact the SeaPort -NxG helpdesk to register a help ticket that the \nportal is down or inoperable prior to the closing time and date.\u201d  Id.   In addition, the RFP \nexplained that in the event \u201c of a portal malfunction, arrangements must be made with \nthe Contracting Officer cognizant for the solicitation prior to the solicitation closing date and time in order to submit a proposal electronically outside the portal \u201d and that \u201c[f] ailure  \nto submit a  complete proposal prior to the solicitation closing date and time will render \nthe proposal late and unacceptable. \u201d  Id.   \n In addition, t he solicitation also incorporated by reference FAR provision 52. 215-1, \nInstructions to Offerors \u2013Competitive Acquisition,  which provided instructions for \nproposal submissions.  Id. at 91.   As relevant here, the provision provides that \nproposals not received by the contracting officer and contract specialist by the exact \ntime specified would be \u201c late\u201d and would not be evaluated unless the proposal  is \nreceived before award is made, the contracting officer determines that accepting the \nlate offer would not unduly delay the acquisition, and one of three exceptions applies.\n3  \nFAR provision 52.215- 1(c)(3)(ii)(A)(1 -3).   \n \n1 Citations to the record are to the documents \u2019 Adobe PDF pagination.  The agency \nissued five amendments to  the RFP; all citations to the RFP are to the consolidated \namended version at attachment  1 of the agency report.  \n2 Throughout the decision, all time references are to Eastern Daylight Time.  \n3 The three exceptions include:  (1) if the proposal  was transmitted through an electronic \ncommerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to \nthe date specified for receipt of proposals , (2) there is acceptable evidence to establish \nthat the proposal  was received at the g overnment installation designated for receipt of \noffers and was under the g overnment\u2019s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers, \n(continued...)   Page 3    B-423379   On February 14, at 4:39 p.m., LPI first logged into the Seaport NgX portal to begin \nuploading its proposal.4  AR, attach. 4, LPI Audit Report at 5 ; COS\/ MOL at 4.  At \n5:07 p.m., seven minutes after the time set for receipt of proposals, LPI\u2019s contracts \nmanager called the Navy\u2019s contract specialist  and left a voicemail message stating:  \u201cI \nwas in the middle of  submitting our proposal . . . and I guess 5 o\u2019clock rolled around and \nit completely threw me  out so I didn\u2019t get a chance to enter the information . . . [or] all of \nthe attachments[.]\u201d  AR, a ttach. 5, Voicemail Screenshot at 1.  LPI\u2019s contracts manager \nasked if the agency would \u201cplease let me email [ ] the proposal directly.\u201d   Id.   \n Thereafter , at around 5:27 p.m., LPI email ed its proposal to the contracting officer and \nthe contract specialist.  AR, attach. 8, Email Correspondence at 15- 16; COS\/ MOL at  5.  \nAt 5:36 p.m., LPI called the contracting officer regarding its attempted proposal \nsubmission; the contracting officer advised that he would review the facts of LPI\u2019s late proposal submission to determine whether the proposal could be accepted or must be rejected as untimely.  AR, attach. 7, Memorandum for Record, Mar. 3, 2025,  at 11.   \n After review, the Navy determined that LPI\u2019s proposal was untimely and therefore must be rejected.  Id.  The Navy notified LPI on February 28, 2025, that its proposal was \nreceived late and thus would not be considered for award.   Id.; COS\/MOL at 5.   On \nMarch 10, LPI filed th e instant  protest with our Office.\n5 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nLPI argues that the Navy unreasonably rejected its proposal as late because LPI\u2019s late \nsubmission was the fault of the agency.  Protest at 5.  In the protester\u2019s view, \nfunctionality issues with the agency\u2019s SeaPort -NxG portal prevented LPI from submitting \nits proposal prior to the 5:00 p.m. deadline on the date proposals were due.  Id.  In this \nregard, the protester explains that it attempted to submit its proposal approximately \n30 minutes before the deadline, but that the SeaPort -NxG portal \u201cfroze\u201d three times --\nonce roughly five minutes before the 5:00 p.m. deadline and two more times after several re- login attempts --preventing LPI from completing its proposal submission via \nthe por tal prior to the deadline.  Protest at 5; Protest, exh. 1, Declaration of LPI \n \nor it is the only proposal received.  FAR provision 52.215- 1(c)(3)(ii)(A)(1 -3).  \nAlternatively, the provision also provides that \u201c a late modification of an otherwise \nsuccessful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be \nconsidered at any time it is received and may be accepted. \u201d  FAR provision 52.215-\n1(c)(3)(ii)(B).  \n4 Although an internal audit conducted by the agency indicates that the LPI first logged \ninto the Seaport NgX portal at 4:39 p.m., the protester represents that it started uploading its submission at 4:20 p.m.  Protest at 5 .   \n5 The estimated value of the task order is $46 million and is therefore within our \njurisdiction to review protests related to the issuance of orders exceeding $3 5 million \nunder multiple- award IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United \nStates Code. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B); see also COS\/MOL at 2 .    Page 4    B-423379   Contracts Specialist at 3.  According to the protester, the late submission of its proposal \nshould be excused because the delay resulted from  \u201cfunctionality issues\u201d with the \nagency\u2019s portal and that \u201c[i]t is entirely unreasonable to expect LPI to submit a proposal when the required means by which to do so is malfunctioning completely\u201d and that the government \u201cmust afford all eligible responsible vendors  . . . a reasonable opportunity to \ncompete.\u201d\n 6  Protest at 6. \n The agency asserts that the protester failed to submit its proposal before the submission deadline  and that the contracting officer \u2019s decision not to consider the \nprotester \u2019s proposal was reasonable and in accordance with solicitation requirements \nand FAR provision 52.215- 1.  COS\/MOL at 6 -11.  Based on the record before us, we \nagree with the agency and find no basis to question its decision to reject LPI\u2019s proposal as late.  \n It is an offeror\u2019s responsibility to deliver its proposal to the proper place at the proper time.  FAR provision 52.215- 1(c)(3); Washingtonian Coach Corp. , B-413809, \nDec. 28, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 378 at 4.  When transmitting a proposal electronically, it is \nan offeror\u2019s responsibility to submit its proposal sufficiently in advance of the time set for receipt of proposals to ensure proper delivery of the proposal and timely receipt by the agency.

Where a protest er \nalleg es non-receipt of a timely submitted proposal due to malfunctioning of the \ngovernment\u2019s electronic submission portal  but fails to demonstrate a systemic failure of \nthe portal , we will not sustain the protest .  NAG Marine, B -422899, Dec. 12, 2024, 2024 \nCPD \u00b6 308  at 7. \n As noted above, the solicitation explained that a proposal was considered timely and would be considered for award when \u201csubmitted through the SeaPort -NxG portal by the \nsolicitation closing date and time, \u201d which was 5:00 p.m. EDT on February 14, 2025.  \nRFP at 2, 95.  Moreover, FAR provision 52.215- 1, which was incorporated into the RFP \nbe reference,  provides  in part, that proposals not received by the contracting officer by \nthe exact time specified would be \u201clate\u201d and would not be evaluated.  Id. at 91.  In \naddition, the RFP advised that in the event of a \u201c portal malfunction, arrangements must \n \n6 In its initial protest, LPI also argued that its proposal should have been accepted by \nthe Navy because, according to the protester, one of the exceptions permitted by FAR provision 52.215- 1 would make acceptance of its late proposal permissible.  Protest at \n5-6.  The agency substantively responded to this allegation in the agency report.  \nCOS\/MOL at 5 -6, 9.  LPI neither refuted the agency\u2019s response nor did it pursue this \nallegation in its comments to the agency report.  See  Comments.   Where, as here, an \nagency provides a detailed response to a protester \u2019s assertion and the protester fails to \nrebut the agency \u2019s arguments in its comments, the protester fails to provide us with a \nbasis to conclude that the agency \u2019s position with respect to the issue in question is \nunreasonable.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.3(i)(3); Medical Staffing Sols. USA, B -415571, \nB-415571.2, Dec. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 384 at  3.  We consider this  allegation to be \nabandoned and do not discuss it  further.  Medical Staffing Sols. USA, supra.   Page 5    B-423379   be made with the Contracting Officer cognizant for the solicitation prior to the solicitation \nclosing date and time in order to submit a proposal electronically outside the portal\u201d and that \u201c[f]ailure to submit a complete proposal prior to the solicitation closing date and time \nwill render the proposal late and unacceptable.\u201d  Id. at 95.   Here, the protester concedes \nthat it did not submit a complete copy of its  proposal via the Seaport -NxG portal by the \n5:00 p.m. deadline.  Protest at 5 ( The protester\u2019s representative \u201cwas unable to \ncomplete the submission by the 5:00 PM deadline. \u201d).  In addition, LPI did not contact the \nSeaPort -NxG helpdesk to register a help ticket to report system issues or notify the \ncognizant contracting officer prior to the 5:00 p.m. February 14, 2025, closing time and date.  COS\/MOL at 3, n. 2.  \n As noted above, LPI  argues that the late submission of its proposal should be excused \nbecause,  according to the protester, the delay was the result of problems with the \nnormal operation of the SeaPort -NxG portal .  To investigate the facts related to \nprotester \u2019s allegations and its attempts to submit its proposal, the SeaPort program \nmanagement office, which is charged with maintaining the operation of the SeaPort \nelectronic portal and administration of the SeaPort -NxG system, conducted an audit that \nrevealed the portal was functioning properly on the date of submissions.  AR, a ttach. 3, \nDeclaration of SeaPort System Project Manager at 2 .  Specifically, the audit revealed \nthat there were \u201cno service tickets or calls from offerors for February 13[th] [or]  14th,\u201d \nincluding no service tickets or calls from LPI, \u201c reporting functionality issues. \u201d  COS\/MOL \nat 6-7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  The audit  also found that another \nofferor \u201csuccessfully uploaded its proposal into the Seaport portal at 3:59 p.m. EDT\u201d on February 14--\u201c40 minutes before LPI started its submission--with no issues reported by\u201d that offeror.  COS\/MOL at 7; AR, attach. 10, SeaPort Ticket Log at 27.  In addition, t he \nrecord reflects that the Navy also received proposals without issue from three other \nofferors via the SeaPort -NxG portal on February  13.  COS\/MOL at 3 -4; AR, a ttach . 9, \nTime Stamped Proposals  at 25.  The record also shows that several subcontractors \nwere able to upload documents into the portal from February 12 through February 14, \nwithout incident.  COS\/MOL at 4; AR, a ttach. 9,  Time Stamped Proposals  at 25. \n Based on the record before us, LPI  has not demonstrated that a disruption to the normal \nprocesses of the SeaPort -NxG portal occurred during the pertinent timeframe .  See \nProtest at 5 -7; Comments at 1 -3.  Although LPI points to an issue it experienced viewing \na solicitation amendment in the portal on February 11, 2025 --three days prior to the \nproposal due date--which the protester reported to the portal help desk, Navy  \nrepresentatives have confirmed the operability of the SeaPort -NxG portal  during the \nperiod in question as normal .  As noted above, the Navy \u2019s audit found that  there were \nno service tickets or calls from offerors reporting functionality issues on February 13 or 14, and that another offeror successfully submitted a timely proposal via  the SeaPort -\nNxG portal  at 3:59 p.m. on February 14, one hour before the proposal deadline.  \nCOS\/MOL at 7.  Further, as pointed out by the agency, even assuming that there w ere \nperiodic glitches in the SeaPort -NxG portal, the occasional malfunctioning of an on- line \nportal does  not rise to the level of systemic failure.   Id. at 9 (citing  Federal Acquisition \nServs. Team , LLC, B -410466, Dec. 31, 2014, 2015 CPD \u00b6 20 at 4) .  On these facts, \nthere is no basis to conclude that the SeaPort -NxG portal  experienced a system failure \nduring the period in question and LPI has not  otherwise  demonstrated government fault .  Page 6    B-423379   Finally, to the extent LPI alleges that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to \ncompete, the record reflects that all offerors, including LPI, were provided ample time to submit proposals and were on notice that late proposals --i.e., proposals not submitted \nthrough the SeaPort -NxG portal by the solicitation closing date and time of 5:00 p.m. on \nFebruary 14--would be rejected as unacceptable in accordance with the solicitation and FAR provision 52.215- 1.  RFP at 2, 95.  The record shows that the Navy \u2019s exclusion of \nLPI\u2019s proposal as late is consistent with the terms of the solicitation  and FAR provision \n52.215- 1.  As a result, we have no basis to sustain the  protest . \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

        "Summary":"1.  Protester is not an interested party to challenge solicitation requirements as unduly \nrestrictive of competition where protester can meet the requirements.   \n 2.  Requirement in Small Business Innovation Research solicitation that proposal be signed by both a unique customer and a unique end- user is reasonable since it \nsupports agency\u2019s obligation to ensure that there is a customer who will support procurement of the item and an end- user that needs the item.  \nDECISION  \n Compotech, Inc., of Brewer, Maine, pro tests the terms of small business innovation \nresearch (SBIR) phase II solicitation, topic AFX24.5, innovative defense- related dual \npurpose technologies\/solutions with a clear Air Force stakeholder need, issued by the Air Force under broad agency announcement (BAA) Department of Defense (D OD) \nX25.5 commercial solutions opening.  Compotech asserts that the solicitation is unduly \nrestrictive of competition  and that the agency is improperly treating a non- material \nrequirement as mandatory.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n \nThe SBIR  program is conducted pursuant to the Small Business Innovation \nDevelopment Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 638, which requires certain federal agencies to reserve a \nportion of their research and development funds for awards to small businesses.  The DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423368  Small Business Administration (SBA) has the statutory obligation to issue policy \ndirectives for the general conduct of the government's SBIR programs.  See 15 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 638(j) ; Agency Report  (AR), Tab 3, SBIR Program Policy Directive at 3.  The SBIR \nprogram has three phases:  p hase I, to determine the scientific, technical, and \ncommercial merit of ideas; p hase II, to perform the principal research and development \neffort resulting in a well -defined, deliverable prototype for particular program needs; and \nphase III, during which the small business must obtain private or  non-SBIR designated \npublic funding to develop the prototype into a viable commercial product for sale to \nmilitary and\/or private sector markets.  AR, Tab 3, SBIR Program Policy Directive at 18-25; See Photonics Optics Tech, Inc. , B-402967, July 28, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6  173 at 1- 2.  \n \nThe end items that the a gency acquires in the first two phases of the SBIR program are \ntypically limited to prototypes or equipment that are incidental to demonstrating the \nfeasibility of technical solutions.  Air Force o pen topics are primarily focused on non-\ndefense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders\u2019 needs.  See AR Tab 14, Phase II Solicitation, amend. 1 at  3, 4.  Air Force open topics do not \nstate defined technological parameters, as the topics are agnostic of industry, technology, and a specific area that the agency wants to see addressed.  Id. at 4.  \nHowever, offerors  are expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of how their \nexisting mature non- defense technical solution can be adapted to meet a specific need \nof a Department of the Air Force customer.   Id.  \n On February 5, 2025, the agency issued the phase II t opic release instructions to \nbusinesses that had received p hase I awards.  AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation.  The \nobjective of p hase II included exploring innovative technologies applicable to both \ndefense and non- defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base \nfor defense.  Id. at 3.  Offerors that submitted phase II proposals were expected to \ndemonstrate a \u201chigh probability of identifying a product -mission fit between a[n] [Air \nForce] stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non- defense comm ercial \nsolution. \u201d  Id.  The topic release instructions explained that this was best accomplished \n\u201cthrough a proposal with a mature non- defense technical solution and a clear \nunderstanding of its adaptation to meet a[n] [Air Force] customer\u2019s specific need, supported by documentation from a specific motivated, empowered [Air Force] end-user, customer, and technical point of contact . . . ready and willing to participate in the proposed prototype solution\u2019s trial.\u201d  Id.  \n Phase II  offerors were instructed that proposals should include development, \ninstallation, integration, demonstration or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.  Id. at 5.  The agency would evaluate proposals against three criteria -\n-technical approach, defense need, and commercialization.  Id. at 10- 11.   \n As relevant to this protest, offerors were required to submit a customer memorandum with their phase II proposal s.  Id.  at 31- 32.  The purpose of the customer memorandum \nis to document interest from an Air Force organization in working with a phase II \nawardee on a proposed phase II effort.  AR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 1.  The solicitation required the customer memorandum  to be signed by a customer and an  Page 3 B-423368  end-user and to include all required signatures.  Phase II Solicitation at 32.  The \nsolicitation also stated that the \u201c[c]ustomer and [e]nd- [u]ser cannot be the same.\u201d1  Id.  \nThe customer organization is the organization that will manage the future procurement \nor sustainment of the solution, and that will manage the funding, contracting, and \nlogistics needs for p hase III awards, as appropriate.  Customer Memorandum  at 1, 7.  \nThe end-user organization is the operational user of the solution being prototyped and is \nthe organization that directly benefits from the solution.  Id.  According to the solicitation,  \n\u201cInclusion of a Customer Memorandum is mandatory for all proposals.  Proposals \nwithout a signed Customer Memorandum or proposals that do not follow the mandatory \ntemplate will not be considered for award.\u201d  Id.  at 15.  \n The solicitation also explained that under the defense need criterion, \u201c[a] complete and compelling [customer memorandum] . . . signed by an appropriate end- user, customer, \nand [technical point of contact] indicates the appropriateness, relevance, and spec ificity \nof an identified [d]efense [n]eed.\u201d  AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation at 10.  In addition, \nthe solicitation stated that under the commercialization criterion, \u201c[t]he existence of \n[p]hase II follow -on commitments for the subject research, and fundi ng commitments \nrelated to the subject effort, whether from government sources, as documented in the [Air Force] [c]ustomer [m]emorandum . . . are evidence of commercialization potential.\u201d  \nId. at 10- 11. \n \nCompotech timely filed its protest challenging the terms of the phase II solicitation on \nMarch 6, the same day proposals were due.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nCompotech protests that the requirement for two unique signatures --one from the \ncustomer and one from the end- user--is unduly restrictive of competition.  Compotech \nfurther asserts that the two -signature requirement should not be considered mandatory \nbecause it is immaterial  in that it does not affect price, quality, quantity, or delivery.   \n We deny the protest.  \n \nUnduly Restrictive of Competition  \n Compotech protests that the requirement for two unique signatures --one from the \ncustomer and one from the end user --is unduly restrictive of competition.  According to \nCompotech only one signature is required to substantiate the information in the customer memorandum.   \n \n \n1 The customer memorandum must also be signed by a technical point of contact who is \nexpected to facilitate interactions between the company and the customer and end- user \norganizations, work to overcome tactical execution barriers, and resolve challenges.  \nThe technical point of contact can be the same person as the customer or the end- user.   \nAR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 1.   Page 4 B-423368  Based on our review of the record, we find that Compotech is not an interested party to \nraise this issue since it is able to meet the requirement.  Compotech acknowledges in its \nprotest that it could have met the requirement but had an issue with timely obtaining the required signatures.  Protest at 6.  Moreover, after the closing date for the receipt of proposals Compotech submitted a customer memorandum with unique signatures from the customer and end- user.  Protester Comments, Att. 1 at 16.  \n We have stated that a prospective offeror generally lacks standing to challenge a \nspecification as unduly restrictive where it can meet the requirement set forth in the solicitation, as such a challenge would be, in essence, on behalf of other potential suppliers who are economically affected by the specification\u2019s allegedly restrictive nature.  Government and Military Certification Systems, Inc., B- 409420, Apr. 2, 2014, \n2014 CPD \u00b6 116 at 4; Accenture Federal Services, LLC, B- 418321.4, Jan. 29, 2021, \n2021 C PD \u00b6 67 at 4.  Because Compotech has acknowledged that it is able to meet this \nrequirement, and in fact has been able to meet it during the pendency of this protest, this basis of protest is dismissed.  \n Material Requirement  \n Com potech protests that it is unreasonable for the agency to treat the two- signature \nrequirement  on the customer memorandum  as mandatory because it is not a material  \nrequirement .  That is, according to Compotech, the signatures do not concern the price, \nquantity, quality , or delivery terms  of the item being procured.     \n Contrary to Compotech\u2019s  argument, agencies are not limited to establishing mandatory \nsolicitation terms that concern only price, quality, quantity, or delivery.  Rather, a contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them provided the requirement is reasonably necessary to meet the agency\u2019s needs.  Helionix Systems,  B-404905.2, May 26, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 106 at 4.    \n   \nHere, the phase II solicitation stated that offerors had to include two unique signatures --\none for the end- user and a different one for the customer --in the customer \nmemorandum and made clear that the failure to provide the required signatures would \nrender  the proposal unacceptable.  The Air Force reasonably established that the two-\nsignature requirement is material .  The agency explains that  the SBIR program is not a \ntraditional procurement where the agency is procur ing a specific end item.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 4.

Blindauer, Blindauer Law, PLLC, for the protester.  \nHector Rivera -Hernandez, Esq., and Erika Whelan Retta, Esq., Department of the Air \nForce, for the agency.  \nMary G. Curcio , Esq., and John Sorrenti, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, \nparticipated in the preparation of the decision.  \nDIGEST  \n 1.  Protester is not an interested party to challenge solicitation requirements as unduly \nrestrictive of competition where protester can meet the requirements.   \n 2.  Requirement in Small Business Innovation Research solicitation that proposal be signed by both a unique customer and a unique end- user is reasonable since it \nsupports agency\u2019s obligation to ensure that there is a customer who will support procurement of the item and an end- user that needs the item.  \nDECISION  \n Compotech, Inc., of Brewer, Maine, pro tests the terms of small business innovation \nresearch (SBIR) phase II solicitation, topic AFX24.5, innovative defense- related dual \npurpose technologies\/solutions with a clear Air Force stakeholder need, issued by the Air Force under broad agency announcement (BAA) Department of Defense (D OD) \nX25.5 commercial solutions opening.  Compotech asserts that the solicitation is unduly \nrestrictive of competition  and that the agency is improperly treating a non- material \nrequirement as mandatory.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n \nThe SBIR  program is conducted pursuant to the Small Business Innovation \nDevelopment Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 638, which requires certain federal agencies to reserve a \nportion of their research and development funds for awards to small businesses.  The DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423368  Small Business Administration (SBA) has the statutory obligation to issue policy \ndirectives for the general conduct of the government's SBIR programs.  See 15 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 638(j) ; Agency Report  (AR), Tab 3, SBIR Program Policy Directive at 3.  The SBIR \nprogram has three phases:  p hase I, to determine the scientific, technical, and \ncommercial merit of ideas; p hase II, to perform the principal research and development \neffort resulting in a well -defined, deliverable prototype for particular program needs; and \nphase III, during which the small business must obtain private or  non-SBIR designated \npublic funding to develop the prototype into a viable commercial product for sale to \nmilitary and\/or private sector markets.  AR, Tab 3, SBIR Program Policy Directive at 18-25; See Photonics Optics Tech, Inc. , B-402967, July 28, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6  173 at 1- 2.  \n \nThe end items that the a gency acquires in the first two phases of the SBIR program are \ntypically limited to prototypes or equipment that are incidental to demonstrating the \nfeasibility of technical solutions.  Air Force o pen topics are primarily focused on non-\ndefense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders\u2019 needs.  See AR Tab 14, Phase II Solicitation, amend. 1 at  3, 4.  Air Force open topics do not \nstate defined technological parameters, as the topics are agnostic of industry, technology, and a specific area that the agency wants to see addressed.  Id. at 4.  \nHowever, offerors  are expected to demonstrate a clear understanding of how their \nexisting mature non- defense technical solution can be adapted to meet a specific need \nof a Department of the Air Force customer.   Id.  \n On February 5, 2025, the agency issued the phase II t opic release instructions to \nbusinesses that had received p hase I awards.  AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation.  The \nobjective of p hase II included exploring innovative technologies applicable to both \ndefense and non- defense markets, scaling capability, and growing the industrial base \nfor defense.  Id. at 3.  Offerors that submitted phase II proposals were expected to \ndemonstrate a \u201chigh probability of identifying a product -mission fit between a[n] [Air \nForce] stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non- defense comm ercial \nsolution. \u201d  Id.  The topic release instructions explained that this was best accomplished \n\u201cthrough a proposal with a mature non- defense technical solution and a clear \nunderstanding of its adaptation to meet a[n] [Air Force] customer\u2019s specific need, supported by documentation from a specific motivated, empowered [Air Force] end-user, customer, and technical point of contact . . . ready and willing to participate in the proposed prototype solution\u2019s trial.\u201d  Id.  \n Phase II  offerors were instructed that proposals should include development, \ninstallation, integration, demonstration or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.  Id. at 5.  The agency would evaluate proposals against three criteria -\n-technical approach, defense need, and commercialization.  Id. at 10- 11.   \n As relevant to this protest, offerors were required to submit a customer memorandum with their phase II proposal s.  Id.  at 31- 32.  The purpose of the customer memorandum \nis to document interest from an Air Force organization in working with a phase II \nawardee on a proposed phase II effort.  AR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 1.  The solicitation required the customer memorandum  to be signed by a customer and an  Page 3 B-423368  end-user and to include all required signatures.  Phase II Solicitation at 32.  The \nsolicitation also stated that the \u201c[c]ustomer and [e]nd- [u]ser cannot be the same.\u201d1  Id.  \nThe customer organization is the organization that will manage the future procurement \nor sustainment of the solution, and that will manage the funding, contracting, and \nlogistics needs for p hase III awards, as appropriate.  Customer Memorandum  at 1, 7.  \nThe end-user organization is the operational user of the solution being prototyped and is \nthe organization that directly benefits from the solution.  Id.  According to the solicitation,  \n\u201cInclusion of a Customer Memorandum is mandatory for all proposals.  Proposals \nwithout a signed Customer Memorandum or proposals that do not follow the mandatory \ntemplate will not be considered for award.\u201d  Id.  at 15.  \n The solicitation also explained that under the defense need criterion, \u201c[a] complete and compelling [customer memorandum] . . . signed by an appropriate end- user, customer, \nand [technical point of contact] indicates the appropriateness, relevance, and spec ificity \nof an identified [d]efense [n]eed.\u201d  AR, Tab 12, Phase II Solicitation at 10.  In addition, \nthe solicitation stated that under the commercialization criterion, \u201c[t]he existence of \n[p]hase II follow -on commitments for the subject research, and fundi ng commitments \nrelated to the subject effort, whether from government sources, as documented in the [Air Force] [c]ustomer [m]emorandum . . . are evidence of commercialization potential.\u201d  \nId. at 10- 11. \n \nCompotech timely filed its protest challenging the terms of the phase II solicitation on \nMarch 6, the same day proposals were due.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nCompotech protests that the requirement for two unique signatures --one from the \ncustomer and one from the end- user--is unduly restrictive of competition.  Compotech \nfurther asserts that the two -signature requirement should not be considered mandatory \nbecause it is immaterial  in that it does not affect price, quality, quantity, or delivery.   \n We deny the protest.  \n \nUnduly Restrictive of Competition  \n Compotech protests that the requirement for two unique signatures --one from the \ncustomer and one from the end user --is unduly restrictive of competition.  According to \nCompotech only one signature is required to substantiate the information in the customer memorandum.   \n \n \n1 The customer memorandum must also be signed by a technical point of contact who is \nexpected to facilitate interactions between the company and the customer and end- user \norganizations, work to overcome tactical execution barriers, and resolve challenges.  \nThe technical point of contact can be the same person as the customer or the end- user.   \nAR, Tab 13, Customer Memorandum at 1.   Page 4 B-423368  Based on our review of the record, we find that Compotech is not an interested party to \nraise this issue since it is able to meet the requirement.  Compotech acknowledges in its \nprotest that it could have met the requirement but had an issue with timely obtaining the required signatures.  Protest at 6.  Moreover, after the closing date for the receipt of proposals Compotech submitted a customer memorandum with unique signatures from the customer and end- user.  Protester Comments, Att. 1 at 16.  \n We have stated that a prospective offeror generally lacks standing to challenge a \nspecification as unduly restrictive where it can meet the requirement set forth in the solicitation, as such a challenge would be, in essence, on behalf of other potential suppliers who are economically affected by the specification\u2019s allegedly restrictive nature.  Government and Military Certification Systems, Inc., B- 409420, Apr. 2, 2014, \n2014 CPD \u00b6 116 at 4; Accenture Federal Services, LLC, B- 418321.4, Jan. 29, 2021, \n2021 C PD \u00b6 67 at 4.  Because Compotech has acknowledged that it is able to meet this \nrequirement, and in fact has been able to meet it during the pendency of this protest, this basis of protest is dismissed.  \n Material Requirement  \n Com potech protests that it is unreasonable for the agency to treat the two- signature \nrequirement  on the customer memorandum  as mandatory because it is not a material  \nrequirement .  That is, according to Compotech, the signatures do not concern the price, \nquantity, quality , or delivery terms  of the item being procured.     \n Contrary to Compotech\u2019s  argument, agencies are not limited to establishing mandatory \nsolicitation terms that concern only price, quality, quantity, or delivery.  Rather, a contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them provided the requirement is reasonably necessary to meet the agency\u2019s needs.  Helionix Systems,  B-404905.2, May 26, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 106 at 4.    \n   \nHere, the phase II solicitation stated that offerors had to include two unique signatures --\none for the end- user and a different one for the customer --in the customer \nmemorandum and made clear that the failure to provide the required signatures would \nrender  the proposal unacceptable.  The Air Force reasonably established that the two-\nsignature requirement is material .  The agency explains that  the SBIR program is not a \ntraditional procurement where the agency is procur ing a specific end item.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 4.  Instead, the Air Force uses  the program with the goal \nof advancing scientific and technical knowledge and applying that knowledge to meet a \nrecognized but unmet agency need, and to later develop a prototype into a viable \ncommercial product for sale to military and or private sector markets.  Id.  at 3-4.

M. Systems Group, Inc. (IMSG), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, requests reconsideration of our decision in I. M. Sys . Grp., Inc., I. M. Sys. Grp ., B-422727.2, \nB-422727.3, Dec. 27, 2024, 2025 CPD \u00b6 56,  in which we denied its protest of the \nissuance of a task order to Science and Technology Corporation (STC), a small business of Hampton, Virginia, under task order request for proposals (TORFP) No. 1332KP24R0005, issued by the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for scientific and technical services.  IMSG argues that our decision contains errors of fact and law that warrant reconsideration.  \n We deny the request for reconsideration.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the TORFP as a small business set -aside, pursuant \nto Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505 procedures, to holders of NOAA\u2019s  ProTech 2.0 Satellite Domain multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2    B-422727.4   quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, TORFP at 2, 14.1  The \ncontemplated task order , titled Atmospheric Science and Technology Applications 2.0, \nsought research and development services for NOAA\u2019s satellite- based atmospheric and \nland surface- related mission goals, including monitoring and understanding Earth\u2019s \natmosphere and land surface using satellite observations.  Id. at 82.  The TORFP \ncontemplated the issuance of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials task order to \nbe performed for a base period of nine months with five option periods  totaling an \nadditional four years .  Id. at 3 7-38, 71.  \n \nThe solicitation  provided that the task order would be issued on a best -value tradeoff \nbasis, considering two factors:  technical approach and price.  Id . at 79 -80.  The \ntechnical factor included three elements, listed in descending order of importance: \ntechnical capability and experience, staffing, and key personnel.  Id . at 74- 75, 80.  The \nsolicitation specified that the technical factor \u201cis significantly more important than \nevaluated price\u201d and advised that \u201cas the non- price factor becomes more comparabl y \nequal amongst [ o]fferors[,] their total evaluated price becomes more important and \ninfluential in determining the best value.\u201d  Id . at 80.  \n For the technical factor and its elements, proposals would be assigned confidence ratings\n2 to determine the agency\u2019s confidence in the offeror\u2019s understanding of , and \nability to effectively meet , the performance work statement (PWS) requirements.  Id.  As \nrelevant here, under the staffing element, offerors were to \u201c [d]iscuss how the [o]fferor\u2019s \nproposed labor mix satisfies the [PWS] requirements [,]\u201d and the TORFP allowed \nofferors the option \u201cto propose different labor mixes than what has historically been used[ .]\u201d  Id.    \n Under the price factor, the solicitation indicated that the government \u201cmay use various price analysis techniques [in accordance with] FAR 15.404- 1\u201d to conduct a price \nanalysis  that \u201cwill determine if the proposed pricing is complete, fair, and reasonable, \naligning with PWS requirements and ProTech 2.0 contract terms.\u201d  Id. at 80.  As \nrelevant here, the solicitation specified that an \u201c[o]fferor\u2019s proposed pricing information \nmust be entirely compatible with its technical proposal [,]\u201d id. at 75, and that \u201cpr ices must \nalign with the [o]fferor\u2019s technical proposal.\u201d  Id. at 80.   \n The agency received five proposals, including from IMSG (the incumbent contractor) and STC.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 6; AR, Tab 10, TET  Consensus \nReport at 8.  Following the agency\u2019s selection of STC\u2019s proposal  for award, IMSG filed \nits first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision.  In response, t he agency proposed to take corrective action by \n \n1 Citations to the record refer to the agency report documents produced in the \nunderlying protest.

Consequently , the agency  reevaluated technical proposals as \nfollows:  \n \n Technical \nCapability \nand \nExperience  Staffing  Key \nPersonnel  Overall \nConsensus  Price  \nIMSG  High \nConfidence  Confident  High \nConfidence  High \nConfidence  $54,522,668  \nSTC High \nConfidence  Confident  Confident  Confident  $35,574,367  \n AR, Tab  10, TET Consensus Report  at 8; COS at 8.  \n Based on this re evaluation, the agency  concluded that STC\u2019s proposal represented the \nbest value to the government , reasoning that IMSG\u2019s technical advantages were not \nworth its associated price premium despite STC\u2019s \u201cslight technical inferiority.\u201d  AR, Tab 12, Business Clearance Memorandum at 27- 28.  The agency again selected STC \nfor award.    IMSG filed another protest on September 23, alleging  that the agency unreasonably \nevaluated the proposals submitted by IMSG and STC .  As relevant here, IMSG filed a \nsupplemental protest on November 4, contending that the agency failed to analyze \nIMSG\u2019s proposed labor mix under the solicitation\u2019s staffing element  and evaluated the \ntwo offerors unequally .  Comments & Supp. Protest at 21- 24.  In addition, IMSG argued \nthat the agency\u2019s price evaluation--including the agency\u2019s alleged obligation to assess whether an offeror\u2019s price proposal was \u201centirely compatible\u201d with its technical proposal -\n-was unreasonable and inadequately documented.  Id . at 7 -8.      \n On December 27, our Office denied IMSG\u2019s protest, finding that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and adequately documented.   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc.; I. M. Sys.

After the issuance of our decision denying \nIMSG\u2019s protest, IMSG requested that our Office reconsider our decision.\n3 \n DISCUSSION  IMSG alleges that our decision erred by failing to address  two \u201cmeritorious\u201d protest  \ngrounds .

Id.  at 1-8.  Second,  IMSG argues that our \ndecision failed to acknowledge and address  the lack of documentation supporting the \nagency\u2019s price evaluation.   Id. at 1, 8- 15.  In this regard, IMSG asserts that the \n\u201cevaluation record contain[ ed] only a single, conclusory sentence\u201d supporting the \nagency\u2019s argument that  all offerors\u2019 proposed pricing were \u201centirely compatible with their \ntechnical proposals [.]\u201d  Id. at 1.  We have reviewed all of IMSG\u2019s arguments and find no \nbasis to reconsider our prior decision.  \n \nUnder our Bid Protest Regulations, to obtain reconsideration, a requesting party must demonstrate that our prior decision contains errors of fact or law, or present new information not previously considered, that would warrant reversal or modification of our earlier decision.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.14(a); Department of Justice; Hope Village, Inc. --Recon. , \nB-414342.5, B -414342.6, May 21, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 195 at 4.

The \nrequester nevertheless asserts that the statutory justification cited for this  practice--to \nprovide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests --does not apply here \nbecause \u201cthe argument which  GAO failed to analyze was a supplemental protest \nground.\u201d  Id.    \n  Page 5    B-422727.4   In this regard, IMSG  argues  that when resolving supplemental protest grounds, if our \nOffice cannot meet the statutory 100- day timeline, \u201cCongress has instructed GAO to \nutilize the express protest option[.]\u201d  Id.  at 4 (citing 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(3)).  The \nrequester then notes  that the statutory mandate providing for the \u201cinexpensive and \nexpeditious resolution of protests\u201d appears in 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(1) --and not in \nsubsection (a)(3).  Id.  Consequently, the requester contends  that the language in (a)(1) \n\u201cdoes not apply\u201d to IMSG\u2019s supplemental protest grounds and \u201ctherefore cannot be used \nto justify GAO\u2019s decision to not address t his argument in its [d]ecision.\u201d  Id .  In effect, the \ngravamen of the requester \u2019s argument is  that our statutory obligation to inexpensively \nand expeditiously resolve protests does not permit our Office to evade our purported \nstatutory obligation to specifically  address every supplemental protest allegation raised \nby a protester --particularly because 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(3) provides our Office with \nadditional time to decide supplemental protest grounds .  See id.   \n As detailed below, we find that this argument fails to allege a cognizable legal error.   \n As a threshold matter, t he requester  cites no statutory  support for the principle that our \ndecisions are obligated to specifically address every argument raised by a protester.  Instead, the requester conflates our statutory requirement to resolve protests  within 100 \ndays with an obligation to specifically address , in our written decision,  every protest \nargument raised.   We find no support for this argument within the language of our \nstatutory requirement, nor does the requester provide any support for such  an assertion.  \nHere, as o ur underlying decision made clear , we considered and resolved all of IMSG\u2019s \nprotest arguments, even if we did not address each specific argument in our written \ndecision.  I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc.; I. M. Sys. Grp. , B-422727.2, B -422727.3,  supra at 5 n.7 \n(\u201cIn its various protest submissions, IMSG has raised arguments that are in addition to, or variations of, those specifically discussed below.  While we do not address all the protester\u2019s arguments, we have considered all of them and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.\u201d).  Thus, we find unavailing the assertion that our Office \n\u201cavoid[ed] resolving\u201d IMSG\u2019s protest grounds.   See Req. for Recon. at 4.  \n Beyond this conflation,  moreover,  the requester\u2019s argument  that our decision violated \napplicable statutory requirements relies on an unreasonable interpretation of the cited \nstatutory authority .  In matters concerning the interpretation of a statute, the first \nquestion is whether the statutory language provides an unambiguous expression of the intent of Congress.  See, e.g., EADS North Am., Inc. , B-291805, Mar. 26, 2003, 2003 \nCPD \u00b6 51 at 4 .  In this regard, we \u201cbegin with the language employed by Congress and \nthe assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d   Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009).  If it \ndoes, the matter ends there, for the unambiguous expressed intent of Congress must be given effect.  ASRC Fed. Data Net work  Techs., LLC , B-418028, B -418028.2, \nDec. 26, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 432 at 8.  Additionally, when  interpreting a statute, \u201cthe \nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall  statutory scheme.\u201d   FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 529 U.S. 120, \n133 (2000).  Consequently, statutory phrases and individual words cannot be viewed in isolation.  See Davis v. Michigan Dep\u2019 t of the Treasury , 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989).   Page 6    B-422727.4    \nAs relevant here, under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), Congress conferred on our Office bid protest jurisdiction subject to specific parameters:   \n \nTo the maximum extent practicable, the Comptroller General shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter.  Except as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Comptroller General shall issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.  \n 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(a)(1).  Congress, thr ough CICA, thus established that our office \u201cshall\u201d \nissue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days --except as provided under \nparagraph (2).  Id.  In paragraph (2), Congress directed the Comptroller General to \n\u201cestablish an express option for deciding those protests which the Comptroller General determines suitable for resolution within 65 days after the date the protest is submitted.\u201d\n4  Id. at \u00a7 3554(a)(2).  Reading these two paragraphs together, we find that \nCongress instructed our Office to issue a final decision \u201cconcerning a protest\u201d within 100 days --but allowed our Office the discretion to determine if certain protests are \u201csuitable \nfor resolution within 65 days [.]\u201d  Id. at \u00a7 3554(a)(1), (2).  \n As noted above, t he requester  charges our Office with \u201cviolat [ing]\u201d paragraph (3), which \nprovides:  \n \nAn amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest, if timely made, should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limit \nestablished under paragraph (1) of this subsection for final decision of the initial \nprotest.  If an amended protest cannot be resolved within such time limit, the Comptroller General may resolve the amended protest through the express option under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  \n Id. at \u00a7 3554(a)(3) .\n5   \n Analyzing the words of this statute, we reject the premise of the requester\u2019s argument that \u201cCongress has instructed\u201d our Office to use the express option to resolve supplemental protest allegations.   Req. for Recon. at 4.   Instead, by using the \npermissive term \u201cmay,\u201d Congress gave our Office the discretion to resolve an amended \nprotest within the 65- day timeline established in paragraph (2).   In this regard,  the first \nclause of section 3554(a)(3) indicates that the new ground of protest \u201cshould\u201d be resolved within the mandatory 100- day timeline established in paragraph (1), to the \n \n4 Consistent with this statutory direction, our regulations establish procedures for use of \nthe express option under appropriate circumstances.  See 4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.10.   \n5 \u201cAn amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest\u201d refers to a \n\u201csupplemental protest,\u201d which is \u201ca new ground of protest\u201d that is timely filed after the \u201cinitial protest.\u201d  See 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(3).   Page 7    B-422727.4   maximum extent practicable.  Id.   The second clause of section 3554(a)(3), however, \nallows that our Office \u201cmay resolve\u201d the new ground of protest through the express \noption if the protest ground cannot be resolved within 100 days.6  Id.   \n We find that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in section 3554(a)(3) represents an \nunambiguous expression of congressional intent to grant  our Office the discretion to \nresolve \u201c[a]n amendment to a protest [,]\u201d i.e., a supplemental protest ground, under the \nterms of the express option.  See id. ; cf. Huston v. United States , 956 F.2d 259, 262 \n(Fed. Cir. 1992) (\u201cWhen, within the same statute, Congress uses both \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may,\u2019 it is differentiating between mandatory and discretionary tasks.\u201d).  We thus reject the \nrequester\u2019s contention that \u201cCongress has instructed GAO to utilize the express protest \noption in order to resolve [IMSG\u2019s] supplemental [protest] ground.\u201d  See Req. for Recon. \nat 4. \n \nIn contrast to the discretionary language used in section 3554(a)(3), the statute uses mandatory language that our Office \u201cshall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter,\u201d to the maximum extent practicable.  Id.      \nat \u00a7 3554(a)(1).  The language of the statute concerning \u201cprotests under this \nsubchapter\u201d does not limit this direction to \u201cinitial protests.\u201d  Nor does the statute give \nany indication that by organizing this mandate under section 3554(a)(1), and not repeating it under section 3554(a)(3), Congress intended to direct our Office to provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of initial protests only.  Instead, we find \nthat the plain words of the statute-- read in context and with a view to t heir place in the \noverall statutory scheme--reveal  the unambiguous congressional intent that we \u201c shall \nprovide\u201d  for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of all protests, to the maximum \nextent practicable.  This statutory direction applies to the \u201cinitial protest\u201d and any \n\u201camendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest,\u201d which are both \u201cprotests \nunder this subchapter.\u201d   See 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a) (1), (3); accord 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(1)(C)  \n(defining a \u201cprotest\u201d as \u201ca written objection by an interested party to [] [a]n award or proposed award of such a contract.\u201d ).   \n \nIn sum , IMSG fails to cite any basis, whether statutory or otherwise, to support the \nargument that  our Office is required to specifically address every argument advanced by \na protester.  As a result, w e find no basis to question our Office\u2019s longstanding practice \nof consider ing and resolv ing all protest grounds, while not necessarily addressing each \nargument or allegation , with specificity, in our written decision.  See, e.g., SageCare, \nInc.--Recon., supra at 3.  We likewise affirm the principle that the absence of  a specific \ndiscussion of a protest ground or argument  is not  indicative of an error of fact or law , \nand does not, by itself, serve as a foundational basis for requests for  reconsideration.   \nSee, e.g., Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, supra at 4.   \n \n6 Similarly, our regulations indicate that our Office  shall resolve supplemental protest \ngrounds within the original 100- day time limit, to the maximum extent practicable, but if \nour Office cannot resolve the supplemental protest ground within that time limit, we \n\u201cmay resolve the supplemental or amended prot est using the express option \nprocedures[.]\u201d  See 4 C.F.R.  \u00a7 21.9.   Page 8    B-422727.4    \nIn addition to alleging that our Office erred by not addressing IMSG\u2019s supplemental protest ground, the requester also a sserts that its prior challenge to the evaluation of \nIMSG\u2019s staffing mix  was \u201cclearly meritorious\u201d and \u201cobjectively supported by the record[.]\u201d  \nReq. for Recon. at 4, 8.  In this regard, IMSG openly repeats its arguments from the \nunderlying protest, which our Office considered and rejected.  The repetition of \narguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet our  standard for granting reconsideration.\n7   4 C.F.R.               \n\u00a7 21.14(c); Bluehorse Corp. --Recon., supra at 4.   \n \nNext the requester argues that our Office committed legal and factual error , and acted \n\u201c[i]nconsistent with [ p]recedent ,\u201d by rejecting IMSG\u2019s argument that the agency\u2019s price \nevaluation was flawed and inadequately documented.  Req. for Recon. at 8- 15.  In this \nregard, IMSG asserts that our decision \u201cfail[ed] to address the fact that the evaluation \nrecord contains only a single, conclusory sentence\u201d that \u201call offerors\u2019 proposed pricing were \u2018entirely compatible with\u2019 their technical proposals[.]\u201d  Id. at 1.  Here, too, IMSG \nrepeats arguments that it raised previously and urges that we reach a different \nconclusion.  IMSG\u2019s repetition of its arguments, and disagreement with our conclusion, \nhowever, do not provide us a basis to reconsider our decision.   Bluehorse Corp. --\nRecon., supra at 4. \n As relevant background, i n its protest and supplemental protest, IMSG raised various \narguments that the agency unreasonably evaluated STC\u2019s price.  Specifically, IMSG asserted that STC\u2019s prices were \u201ctoo low to align\u201d with the PWS requirements and the \nProTech 2.0 master IDIQ contr act terms, as required by the TORFP.  Protest at 10.  \nIMSG also alleged that STC\u2019s low labor rates were too low to align with its technical \napproach and would prevent STC from matching incumbent salaries.  Comments & \nSupp. Protest at 3- 7.  Additionally, IM SG argued that the agency\u2019s price evaluation \ndocumentation should have provided greater detail explaining how STC\u2019s price was \n\u201centirely compatible with its technical proposal.\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8. \n \n7 Even were we to consider these arguments, we would find no basis to grant \nreconsideration.  For example, the requester asserts that the agency did not respond directly to an argument that NOAA treated offerors disparately by crediting those offerors\u2019 proposed labor mixes but not IMSG\u2019s, and thus \u201cconceded\u201d IMSG\u2019s claim of disparate treatment.  Req. for Recon. at 2, 7.  Contrary to the requester\u2019s suggestion, however, the record reflects that the agency explained, in response to this protest ground, that the evaluators\u2019 assessment of IMSG\u2019s proposed labor mix was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria.  See  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  6-\n7; Supp. COS at 6.  The agency\u2019s response in the supplemental agency report wa s \nconsistent with the initial agency report arguing that the agency reasonably and evenly evaluated IMSG and STC\u2019s proposals under the staffing element.  See MOL at 6 -7, 16, \n23-25; COS at 6, 16, 18.  We thus  see no support for the requester\u2019s argument that the \nagency \u201cconceded\u201d IMSG\u2019s claim of disparate treatment under the staffing element or that IMSG\u2019s protest ground was \u201cobjectively supported by the record.\u201d  See  Req. for \nRecon. at 7- 8.    Page 9    B-422727.4    \nIn our decision, we analyzed all of IMSG\u2019s protest and supplemental protest grounds and found that the documentation supporting the agency\u2019s price evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  See   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; \nI. M. Sys. Grp., B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 5-7.   \n In its request for reconsideration, IMSG argues that our Office \u201cerred legally by ignoring its own precedent and changing the standard for what constitutes a reasonable and adequately documented evaluation.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at 15.  IMSG also argues that our decision rests on various \u201cfactual errors [,]\u201d and \u201cignore[ d]\u201d various facts and arguments \nthat IMSG raised in its protest and supplemental protest.  See id . at 9 -15.  For example, \nIMSG asserts that our decision did not specifically address its  argument that \u201cSTC will \nnot be able to match any incumbent employee\u2019s salary, because STC\u2019s proposed labor \nrates are all 60- 70 [percent]  lower than IMSG\u2019s incumbent rates.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at 12 \n(citing  Supp. Protest at 10).  Finally, IMSG contends that our decision erred by \n\u201cdismissing an argument that IMSG did not make,\u201d citing the statement in our decision that \u201cto the extent the protester is alleging the agency should have conducted a price realism analysis , we dismiss this aspect of the protest.\u201d  See id.  at 8 n.4 (citing I. M. \nSys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp.,  B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7-8 n.9) .  The \nrequester argues that our decision erred by including this statement because IMSG \u201cdid not make a price realism challenge.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at 8 n.4.  \n Notwithstanding this disclaimer,  however,  IMSG faults  the agency for not providing \ndocument ation  more consistent with a price realism evaluation than an evaluation \nconducted under the price evaluation criteria in this TORFP.   In this regard, IMSG \nargues that the solicitation required the agency to evaluate whether offerors\u2019 pricing information was \u201centirely compatible with its technical proposal ,\u201d\n8 which  meant that \nNOAA should have conducted and documented an evaluation that  compared STC\u2019s low \npricing to its technical proposal.   See Req. for Recon. at 8 -15.  Specifically, IMSG \nargues that the agency should have scrutinized, and better documented, an analysis of  \nSTC\u2019s proposed incumbent capture approach in light of its low pricing.  Id. at 12- 14.   \n Such an analysis, however, would have effectively amounted to a price realism \nanalysis, which was not required by this  solicitation.   As our underlying decision noted, \nthe more extensive  documentation urged by IMSG  was not required by the solicitation, \n\u201cparticularly given the discretion accorded to agencies conducting a price analysis .\u201d       \nI. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp. , B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7.  Instead, the \n \n8 We note, too, that  the requester  conflates an instruction to offerors --that their pricing \nbe \u201centirely compatible\u201d with their technical proposals , see TORFP at 75--with an \nevaluation criteri on.  Our Office has repeatedly found that information provided in a \nsolicitation \u2019s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria \ndetailed in a solicitation\u2019 s evaluation section.  See , e.g.,  All Phase Envt \u2019l, Inc.,               \nB-292919.2 et al. , Feb. 4, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6  62 at 4 (noting that rather than \nestablishing minimum evaluation standards, solicitation instructions generally provide guidance to assist offerors in preparing and organizing proposals) .  Page 10    B-422727.4   agency was required to determine whether STC\u2019s proposed prices aligned with its \ntechnical proposal and with the PWS requirements, and we found that the agency reasonably made this determination.  Id.   While IMSG disagrees with this outcome, we \nfind no reason to question our conclusion that the agency\u2019s evaluation was  reasonable \nand consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria.  \n In sum, IMSG\u2019s request for reconsideration fails to allege a cognizable legal error,  \nexpresses disagreement with our decision denying its earlier protest, repeats arguments made during our consideration of the protest, and does not present information that was not previously considered.  IMSG\u2019s request does not satisfy our standard for reconsideration and does not provide a basis for reversing our prior decision.  \n The request for reconsideration is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

IMSG argues that our decision contains errors of fact and law that warrant reconsideration.  \n We deny the request for reconsideration.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On April 5, 2024, the agency issued the TORFP as a small business set -aside, pursuant \nto Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505 procedures, to holders of NOAA\u2019s  ProTech 2.0 Satellite Domain multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.

Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, TORFP at 2, 14.1  The \ncontemplated task order , titled Atmospheric Science and Technology Applications 2.0, \nsought research and development services for NOAA\u2019s satellite- based atmospheric and \nland surface- related mission goals, including monitoring and understanding Earth\u2019s \natmosphere and land surface using satellite observations.  Id. at 82.  The TORFP \ncontemplated the issuance of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials task order to \nbe performed for a base period of nine months with five option periods  totaling an \nadditional four years .  Id. at 3 7-38, 71.  \n \nThe solicitation  provided that the task order would be issued on a best -value tradeoff \nbasis, considering two factors:  technical approach and price.  Id . at 79 -80.  The \ntechnical factor included three elements, listed in descending order of importance: \ntechnical capability and experience, staffing, and key personnel.  Id . at 74- 75, 80.  The \nsolicitation specified that the technical factor \u201cis significantly more important than \nevaluated price\u201d and advised that \u201cas the non- price factor becomes more comparabl y \nequal amongst [ o]fferors[,] their total evaluated price becomes more important and \ninfluential in determining the best value.\u201d  Id . at 80.  \n For the technical factor and its elements, proposals would be assigned confidence ratings\n2 to determine the agency\u2019s confidence in the offeror\u2019s understanding of , and \nability to effectively meet , the performance work statement (PWS) requirements.  Id.  As \nrelevant here, under the staffing element, offerors were to \u201c [d]iscuss how the [o]fferor\u2019s \nproposed labor mix satisfies the [PWS] requirements [,]\u201d and the TORFP allowed \nofferors the option \u201cto propose different labor mixes than what has historically been used[ .]\u201d  Id.    \n Under the price factor, the solicitation indicated that the government \u201cmay use various price analysis techniques [in accordance with] FAR 15.404- 1\u201d to conduct a price \nanalysis  that \u201cwill determine if the proposed pricing is complete, fair, and reasonable, \naligning with PWS requirements and ProTech 2.0 contract terms.\u201d  Id. at 80.  As \nrelevant here, the solicitation specified that an \u201c[o]fferor\u2019s proposed pricing information \nmust be entirely compatible with its technical proposal [,]\u201d id. at 75, and that \u201cpr ices must \nalign with the [o]fferor\u2019s technical proposal.\u201d  Id. at 80.   \n The agency received five proposals, including from IMSG (the incumbent contractor) and STC.

The agency again selected STC \nfor award.    IMSG filed another protest on September 23, alleging  that the agency unreasonably \nevaluated the proposals submitted by IMSG and STC .  As relevant here, IMSG filed a \nsupplemental protest on November 4, contending that the agency failed to analyze \nIMSG\u2019s proposed labor mix under the solicitation\u2019s staffing element  and evaluated the \ntwo offerors unequally .

In furtherance of this \nargument , the requester first acknowledges our Office\u2019s longstanding practice of not \naddressing all arguments, with specificity, in our written decisions.   Id. at 3 .  The \nrequester nevertheless asserts that the statutory justification cited for this  practice--to \nprovide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests --does not apply here \nbecause \u201cthe argument which  GAO failed to analyze was a supplemental protest \nground.\u201d  Id.    \n  Page 5    B-422727.4   In this regard, IMSG  argues  that when resolving supplemental protest grounds, if our \nOffice cannot meet the statutory 100- day timeline, \u201cCongress has instructed GAO to \nutilize the express protest option[.]\u201d  Id.  at 4 (citing 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(3)).  The \nrequester then notes  that the statutory mandate providing for the \u201cinexpensive and \nexpeditious resolution of protests\u201d appears in 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(1) --and not in \nsubsection (a)(3).  Id.  Consequently, the requester contends  that the language in (a)(1) \n\u201cdoes not apply\u201d to IMSG\u2019s supplemental protest grounds and \u201ctherefore cannot be used \nto justify GAO\u2019s decision to not address t his argument in its [d]ecision.\u201d  Id .  In effect, the \ngravamen of the requester \u2019s argument is  that our statutory obligation to inexpensively \nand expeditiously resolve protests does not permit our Office to evade our purported \nstatutory obligation to specifically  address every supplemental protest allegation raised \nby a protester --particularly because 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(3) provides our Office with \nadditional time to decide supplemental protest grounds .  See id.   \n As detailed below, we find that this argument fails to allege a cognizable legal error.   \n As a threshold matter, t he requester  cites no statutory  support for the principle that our \ndecisions are obligated to specifically address every argument raised by a protester.  Instead, the requester conflates our statutory requirement to resolve protests  within 100 \ndays with an obligation to specifically address , in our written decision,  every protest \nargument raised.   We find no support for this argument within the language of our \nstatutory requirement, nor does the requester provide any support for such  an assertion.  \nHere, as o ur underlying decision made clear , we considered and resolved all of IMSG\u2019s \nprotest arguments, even if we did not address each specific argument in our written \ndecision.

While we do not address all the protester\u2019s arguments, we have considered all of them and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.\u201d).  Thus, we find unavailing the assertion that our Office \n\u201cavoid[ed] resolving\u201d IMSG\u2019s protest grounds.   See Req. for Recon. at 4.  \n Beyond this conflation,  moreover,  the requester\u2019s argument  that our decision violated \napplicable statutory requirements relies on an unreasonable interpretation of the cited \nstatutory authority .  In matters concerning the interpretation of a statute, the first \nquestion is whether the statutory language provides an unambiguous expression of the intent of Congress.  See, e.g., EADS North Am., Inc. , B-291805, Mar. 26, 2003, 2003 \nCPD \u00b6 51 at 4 .  In this regard, we \u201cbegin with the language employed by Congress and \nthe assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d   Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 175 (2009).  If it \ndoes, the matter ends there, for the unambiguous expressed intent of Congress must be given effect.  ASRC Fed.

Additionally, when  interpreting a statute, \u201cthe \nwords of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall  statutory scheme.\u201d   FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 529 U.S. 120, \n133 (2000).  Consequently, statutory phrases and individual words cannot be viewed in isolation.  See Davis v. Michigan Dep\u2019 t of the Treasury , 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989).   Page 6    B-422727.4    \nAs relevant here, under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), Congress conferred on our Office bid protest jurisdiction subject to specific parameters:   \n \nTo the maximum extent practicable, the Comptroller General shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter.  Except as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Comptroller General shall issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.  \n 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(a)(1).  Congress, thr ough CICA, thus established that our office \u201cshall\u201d \nissue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days --except as provided under \nparagraph (2).  Id.  In paragraph (2), Congress directed the Comptroller General to \n\u201cestablish an express option for deciding those protests which the Comptroller General determines suitable for resolution within 65 days after the date the protest is submitted.\u201d\n4  Id. at \u00a7 3554(a)(2).  Reading these two paragraphs together, we find that \nCongress instructed our Office to issue a final decision \u201cconcerning a protest\u201d within 100 days --but allowed our Office the discretion to determine if certain protests are \u201csuitable \nfor resolution within 65 days [.]\u201d  Id. at \u00a7 3554(a)(1), (2).  \n As noted above, t he requester  charges our Office with \u201cviolat [ing]\u201d paragraph (3), which \nprovides:  \n \nAn amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest, if timely made, should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limit \nestablished under paragraph (1) of this subsection for final decision of the initial \nprotest.  If an amended protest cannot be resolved within such time limit, the Comptroller General may resolve the amended protest through the express option under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  \n Id. at \u00a7 3554(a)(3) .\n5   \n Analyzing the words of this statute, we reject the premise of the requester\u2019s argument that \u201cCongress has instructed\u201d our Office to use the express option to resolve supplemental protest allegations.   Req. for Recon. at 4.   Instead, by using the \npermissive term \u201cmay,\u201d Congress gave our Office the discretion to resolve an amended \nprotest within the 65- day timeline established in paragraph (2).   In this regard,  the first \nclause of section 3554(a)(3) indicates that the new ground of protest \u201cshould\u201d be resolved within the mandatory 100- day timeline established in paragraph (1), to the \n \n4 Consistent with this statutory direction, our regulations establish procedures for use of \nthe express option under appropriate circumstances.  See 4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.10.   \n5 \u201cAn amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest\u201d refers to a \n\u201csupplemental protest,\u201d which is \u201ca new ground of protest\u201d that is timely filed after the \u201cinitial protest.\u201d  See 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a)(3).   Page 7    B-422727.4   maximum extent practicable.  Id.   The second clause of section 3554(a)(3), however, \nallows that our Office \u201cmay resolve\u201d the new ground of protest through the express \noption if the protest ground cannot be resolved within 100 days.6  Id.   \n We find that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in section 3554(a)(3) represents an \nunambiguous expression of congressional intent to grant  our Office the discretion to \nresolve \u201c[a]n amendment to a protest [,]\u201d i.e., a supplemental protest ground, under the \nterms of the express option.  See id. ; cf. Huston v. United States , 956 F.2d 259, 262 \n(Fed. Cir. 1992) (\u201cWhen, within the same statute, Congress uses both \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may,\u2019 it is differentiating between mandatory and discretionary tasks.\u201d).  We thus reject the \nrequester\u2019s contention that \u201cCongress has instructed GAO to utilize the express protest \noption in order to resolve [IMSG\u2019s] supplemental [protest] ground.\u201d  See Req. for Recon. \nat 4. \n \nIn contrast to the discretionary language used in section 3554(a)(3), the statute uses mandatory language that our Office \u201cshall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter,\u201d to the maximum extent practicable.  Id.      \nat \u00a7 3554(a)(1).  The language of the statute concerning \u201cprotests under this \nsubchapter\u201d does not limit this direction to \u201cinitial protests.\u201d  Nor does the statute give \nany indication that by organizing this mandate under section 3554(a)(1), and not repeating it under section 3554(a)(3), Congress intended to direct our Office to provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of initial protests only.  Instead, we find \nthat the plain words of the statute-- read in context and with a view to t heir place in the \noverall statutory scheme--reveal  the unambiguous congressional intent that we \u201c shall \nprovide\u201d  for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of all protests, to the maximum \nextent practicable.  This statutory direction applies to the \u201cinitial protest\u201d and any \n\u201camendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest,\u201d which are both \u201cprotests \nunder this subchapter.\u201d   See 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3554(a) (1), (3); accord 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(1)(C)  \n(defining a \u201cprotest\u201d as \u201ca written objection by an interested party to [] [a]n award or proposed award of such a contract.\u201d ).   \n \nIn sum , IMSG fails to cite any basis, whether statutory or otherwise, to support the \nargument that  our Office is required to specifically address every argument advanced by \na protester.  As a result, w e find no basis to question our Office\u2019s longstanding practice \nof consider ing and resolv ing all protest grounds, while not necessarily addressing each \nargument or allegation , with specificity, in our written decision.  See, e.g., SageCare, \nInc.--Recon., supra at 3.  We likewise affirm the principle that the absence of  a specific \ndiscussion of a protest ground or argument  is not  indicative of an error of fact or law , \nand does not, by itself, serve as a foundational basis for requests for  reconsideration.   \nSee, e.g., Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, supra at 4.   \n \n6 Similarly, our regulations indicate that our Office  shall resolve supplemental protest \ngrounds within the original 100- day time limit, to the maximum extent practicable, but if \nour Office cannot resolve the supplemental protest ground within that time limit, we \n\u201cmay resolve the supplemental or amended prot est using the express option \nprocedures[.]\u201d  See 4 C.F.R.  \u00a7 21.9.   Page 8    B-422727.4    \nIn addition to alleging that our Office erred by not addressing IMSG\u2019s supplemental protest ground, the requester also a sserts that its prior challenge to the evaluation of \nIMSG\u2019s staffing mix  was \u201cclearly meritorious\u201d and \u201cobjectively supported by the record[.]\u201d  \nReq. for Recon. at 4, 8.  In this regard, IMSG openly repeats its arguments from the \nunderlying protest, which our Office considered and rejected.  The repetition of \narguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet our  standard for granting reconsideration.\n7   4 C.F.R.               \n\u00a7 21.14(c); Bluehorse Corp. --Recon., supra at 4.   \n \nNext the requester argues that our Office committed legal and factual error , and acted \n\u201c[i]nconsistent with [ p]recedent ,\u201d by rejecting IMSG\u2019s argument that the agency\u2019s price \nevaluation was flawed and inadequately documented.  Req. for Recon. at 8- 15.  In this \nregard, IMSG asserts that our decision \u201cfail[ed] to address the fact that the evaluation \nrecord contains only a single, conclusory sentence\u201d that \u201call offerors\u2019 proposed pricing were \u2018entirely compatible with\u2019 their technical proposals[.]\u201d  Id. at 1.  Here, too, IMSG \nrepeats arguments that it raised previously and urges that we reach a different \nconclusion.  IMSG\u2019s repetition of its arguments, and disagreement with our conclusion, \nhowever, do not provide us a basis to reconsider our decision.   Bluehorse Corp. --\nRecon., supra at 4. \n As relevant background, i n its protest and supplemental protest, IMSG raised various \narguments that the agency unreasonably evaluated STC\u2019s price.  Specifically, IMSG asserted that STC\u2019s prices were \u201ctoo low to align\u201d with the PWS requirements and the \nProTech 2.0 master IDIQ contr act terms, as required by the TORFP.  Protest at 10.  \nIMSG also alleged that STC\u2019s low labor rates were too low to align with its technical \napproach and would prevent STC from matching incumbent salaries.  Comments & \nSupp. Protest at 3- 7.  Additionally, IM SG argued that the agency\u2019s price evaluation \ndocumentation should have provided greater detail explaining how STC\u2019s price was \n\u201centirely compatible with its technical proposal.\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8. \n \n7 Even were we to consider these arguments, we would find no basis to grant \nreconsideration.  For example, the requester asserts that the agency did not respond directly to an argument that NOAA treated offerors disparately by crediting those offerors\u2019 proposed labor mixes but not IMSG\u2019s, and thus \u201cconceded\u201d IMSG\u2019s claim of disparate treatment.  Req. for Recon. at 2, 7.  Contrary to the requester\u2019s suggestion, however, the record reflects that the agency explained, in response to this protest ground, that the evaluators\u2019 assessment of IMSG\u2019s proposed labor mix was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria.  See  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  6-\n7; Supp. COS at 6.  The agency\u2019s response in the supplemental agency report wa s \nconsistent with the initial agency report arguing that the agency reasonably and evenly evaluated IMSG and STC\u2019s proposals under the staffing element.  See MOL at 6 -7, 16, \n23-25; COS at 6, 16, 18.  We thus  see no support for the requester\u2019s argument that the \nagency \u201cconceded\u201d IMSG\u2019s claim of disparate treatment under the staffing element or that IMSG\u2019s protest ground was \u201cobjectively supported by the record.\u201d  See  Req. for \nRecon. at 7- 8.    Page 9    B-422727.4    \nIn our decision, we analyzed all of IMSG\u2019s protest and supplemental protest grounds and found that the documentation supporting the agency\u2019s price evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  See   I. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; \nI. M. Sys. Grp., B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 5-7.   \n In its request for reconsideration, IMSG argues that our Office \u201cerred legally by ignoring its own precedent and changing the standard for what constitutes a reasonable and adequately documented evaluation.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at 15.  IMSG also argues that our decision rests on various \u201cfactual errors [,]\u201d and \u201cignore[ d]\u201d various facts and arguments \nthat IMSG raised in its protest and supplemental protest.  See id . at 9 -15.  For example, \nIMSG asserts that our decision did not specifically address its  argument that \u201cSTC will \nnot be able to match any incumbent employee\u2019s salary, because STC\u2019s proposed labor \nrates are all 60- 70 [percent]  lower than IMSG\u2019s incumbent rates.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at 12 \n(citing  Supp. Protest at 10).  Finally, IMSG contends that our decision erred by \n\u201cdismissing an argument that IMSG did not make,\u201d citing the statement in our decision that \u201cto the extent the protester is alleging the agency should have conducted a price realism analysis , we dismiss this aspect of the protest.\u201d  See id.  at 8 n.4 (citing I. M. \nSys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp.,  B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7-8 n.9) .  The \nrequester argues that our decision erred by including this statement because IMSG \u201cdid not make a price realism challenge.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at 8 n.4.  \n Notwithstanding this disclaimer,  however,  IMSG faults  the agency for not providing \ndocument ation  more consistent with a price realism evaluation than an evaluation \nconducted under the price evaluation criteria in this TORFP.   In this regard, IMSG \nargues that the solicitation required the agency to evaluate whether offerors\u2019 pricing information was \u201centirely compatible with its technical proposal ,\u201d\n8 which  meant that \nNOAA should have conducted and documented an evaluation that  compared STC\u2019s low \npricing to its technical proposal.   See Req. for Recon. at 8 -15.  Specifically, IMSG \nargues that the agency should have scrutinized, and better documented, an analysis of  \nSTC\u2019s proposed incumbent capture approach in light of its low pricing.  Id. at 12- 14.   \n Such an analysis, however, would have effectively amounted to a price realism \nanalysis, which was not required by this  solicitation.   As our underlying decision noted, \nthe more extensive  documentation urged by IMSG  was not required by the solicitation, \n\u201cparticularly given the discretion accorded to agencies conducting a price analysis .\u201d       \nI. M. Sys. Grp., Inc .; I. M. Sys. Grp. , B-422727.2,  B-422727.3, supra at 7.  Instead, the \n \n8 We note, too, that  the requester  conflates an instruction to offerors --that their pricing \nbe \u201centirely compatible\u201d with their technical proposals , see TORFP at 75--with an \nevaluation criteri on.  Our Office has repeatedly found that information provided in a \nsolicitation \u2019s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria \ndetailed in a solicitation\u2019 s evaluation section.  See , e.g.,  All Phase Envt \u2019l, Inc.,               \nB-292919.2 et al. , Feb. 4, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6  62 at 4 (noting that rather than \nestablishing minimum evaluation standards, solicitation instructions generally provide guidance to assist offerors in preparing and organizing proposals) .  Page 10    B-422727.4   agency was required to determine whether STC\u2019s proposed prices aligned with its \ntechnical proposal and with the PWS requirements, and we found that the agency reasonably made this determination.  Id.   While IMSG disagrees with this outcome, we \nfind no reason to question our conclusion that the agency\u2019s evaluation was  reasonable \nand consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria.  \n In sum, IMSG\u2019s request for reconsideration fails to allege a cognizable legal error,  \nexpresses disagreement with our decision denying its earlier protest, repeats arguments made during our consideration of the protest, and does not present information that was not previously considered.  IMSG\u2019s request does not satisfy our standard for reconsideration and does not provide a basis for reversing our prior decision.  \n The request for reconsideration is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

Protest challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals is denied where the evaluation was reasonable, in accordance with the terms of the solicitation and applicable regulations.  \n 2.  Protest contending that the agency engaged in disparate treatment is denied where the protester fails to demonstrate that differences in the evaluation did not stem from \ndifferences in the proposals.  \nDECISION  \n Strategic Alliance, Inc.  (SAI), of El Segundo, California, protests the elimination of its \nproposal  from the competition under request for proposals  (RFP) \nNo. 47QRCA23R0005, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA), for total \nintegrated solutions for a multitude of services -based requirements.   The protester \ncontends that the agency unreasonably concluded that the protester was ineligible for award under the solicitation, which was set aside for women- owned small businesses \n(WOSBs ), because at the time of proposal submission, the protester was not a certified \nWOSB and did not have a pending application for WOSB certification in the Dynamic \nSmall Business Search (DSBS).\n1  The protester also contends that the agency engaged \nin disparate treatment by failing to eliminate other proposals from the competition despite those offerors lacking the required WOSB status.   \n \n1 DSBS is a database used by agencies to , among other things, verify the small \nbusiness status of firms for upcoming contracts.   See generally  Agency Report (AR), \nTab 5, SAI DSBS Record .  Page 2 B-423359  We deny the protest.  \n  \nBACKGROUND  \n \nOn June 15, 2023, GSA issued the One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services \nPlus (OASIS+) WOSB solicitation, seeking proposals  to provide agencies with total \nintegrated solutions for a multitude of services -based requirements on a global basis.2  \nAR, Tab 4, RFP at  21.  The solicitation contemplated the award of an unlimited number \nof indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contracts .  Id. at 114, 198.  The due date for \nproposals, as amended,  was October 20, 2023.   Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) \nat 3. \n The solicitation provided that the agency intended to award contracts to all qualifying \nofferor s that, among other things,  submitted a proposal that conform ed to the \nrequirements of the solicitation and proposed  a fair and reasonable price.  RFP at  198.  \nAs relevant here, the solicitation further provided that offeror s must be certified by the \nSmall Business Administration (SBA)  as a WOSB or an Economically Disadvantaged \nWomen- Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) pursuant to 13 CFR \u00a7  127.300 and Federal \nAcquisitio n Regulation ( FAR)  section 19.15 to be eligible for award.  RFP at  23.  The \nsolicitation permitted  offerors  to submit a proposal  if the offeror had a pending \napplication for EDWOSB or WOSB certification in DSBS.   Id. \n \nThe Elimination of SAI\u2019s Proposal from the Competition \n \nThe agency received proposals  from 589 offerors by the due date on October  20, 2023, \nincluding one from SAI.  COS at 8.  On September  25, 2024, t he agency informed SAI  \nthat its proposal \u201c does not appear to be eligible for award\u201d because SAI  was not an \nSBA- certified WOSB and did not have a pending application for WOSB certification  at \nthe time of  proposal  submission.  Id.  at 9; AR, Tab 5, SAI DSBS Record at  2.  The \nagency  further informed  SAI that if it believed the foregoing assessment of ineligibility to \nbe inaccurate, it could \u201cprovide evidence to the contrary of [the] SBA certification at the \ntime of offer.\u201d  COS at  9.  On September 28, 2024, SAI provided a copy of an \nautomated email from  SBA dated October 19, 2023,  which  confirmed that SBA had \nreceived SAI\u2019s application  to participate in the SBA WOSB Federal Contract Program .  \nId.; Protest, e xh. 5, SBA Certification Receipt at  1.  The contracting officer contacted the \nSBA on November  4, 2024,  to verify the WOSB status  of SAI at the time of proposal \nsubmission ; the SBA confirme d that SAI was not in pending or certified status at the \ntime of the proposal submission.  AR, Tab 7, SBA Review of WOSB Certification at  1-3; \nCOS at  9. \n   \n \n2 The family of OASIS + contracts includes the following categories:  unrestricted, small \nbusiness set-aside, WOSB set -side, 8(a) small business set -aside, service -disabled \nveteran- owned small business set-aside, and historically underutilized business zone \nsmall business  set-aside.  RFP at  12.  Page 3 B-423359  The agency concluded that SAI was not an eligible offeror and issued an unsuccessful \nofferor letter to SAI on January  14, 2025, stating that SAI \u201c did not have a certification or \npending application for EDWOSB or WOSB certification in [DSBS] at the time of offer \nsubmission to the OASIS+ WOSB set -aside. \u201d  Protest, exh.  1, Unsuccessful  Offeror \nLetter at  2.  SAI requested that the contracting officer reconsider h er decision \nconcerning SAI\u2019s WOSB certification and provided WOSB certification from a source \nother than SBA.   COS at  9; Protest, exh. 2, SAI Req . for Recon.  at 1-2.  The contracting \nofficer upheld the agency\u2019s decision, concluding that the third- party certification was \ndated January  13, 2025, which was more than a year after the due date for proposals.   \nProtest, exh. 4, GSA Resp . at 1.  The contracting officer further noted that SAI was not \na certified WOSB, or in pending status, at the time of the due date for proposals.  Id.   \n \nSAI filed an agency -level protest on January 24, protesting the agency\u2019s determination \nthat SAI was ineligible for award.   COS at 10.  The agency denied the protest on \nFebruary 26 .  Id.  This protest with our Office followed.  \n DISCUSSION  SAI raises three main  arguments with respect to the agency\u2019s  elimination of its proposal \nfrom the competition.  First, SAI argues that  the agency unreasonably eliminated its \nproposal from the competition.  Comments at  1.  Specifically, SAI contends that it \nsubmitted its application for WOSB certification prior to the due date for proposals and \ntherefore, had a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that its certification w as pending at the time of \nproposal submission.   Id. at 2.  Second, SAI argues that the agency should not have \nrelied upon DSBS for verification of an offeror\u2019s WOSB status.  Id. at 2-3.  Third, SAI \nargues that the agency engaged in disparate treatment by awarding contracts to firms that currently do not have pending applications for WOSB certification and are not WOSB certified .  Id. at 3-6; Supp. Protest at  3-4.  For reasons discussed below, we \ndeny the protest.\n3 \n In reviewing a protest challenging an agency\u2019s evaluation, our Office will not reevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion.  22nd Century Techs., Inc. , \nB-420139, Dec. 9, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 8 at 4.  Rather, we will review the record to \ndetermine whether the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id.  A \nprotester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without more, is insufficient to establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Id. \n SAI first argues that it had a reasonable expectation that its application for WOSB certification was pending when it submitted its proposal because it filed its application for WOSB certification one day before the due date for proposals .  Comments at  1-2.  \nThe agency disagrees, arguing that SAI was not a certified WOSB , and did not have a \n \n3 Although we do not address every argument raised by the protester, we have \nconsidered them and find none to be meritorious.   Page 4 B-423359  pending application for WOSB certification in DSBS, prior to the submission of its \nproposal .  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  4-5. \n As an initial matter, we note that FAR  section 19.1505(e)  provides:  \n \nThe contracting officer shall verify that offers received are eligible for consideration for award by checking [System for Award Management (SAM)] to see if the EDWOSB or WOSB concern is designated as a certified concern or checking DSBS for a pending appl ication for \ncertification.   \n (1) If the offeror is designated as certified in SAM or has a pending application for certification in DSBS, proceed with the offer evaluation.   \n \n(2) Unless the offeror is designated as certified in SAM or has a pending application for certification in DSBS, the offer is not eligible for award and shall be removed from consideration.  \n The parties agree that DSBS did not show SAI as WOSB certified or with a pending \napplication at the time of proposal submission.  COS at 9;  Comments at 1 (stating that \n\u201cSAI\u2019s argument is  not over the status shown in DSBS\u201d) .  Instead, the dispute concerns \nthe interpretation of the term \u201cpending\u201d  and whether DSBS should have shown that SAI \nhad a pending application at the time of proposal submission.  Comments at  1-2.  \nAccording to the protester, the term \u201cpending\u201d is ambiguous and the protester  \n\u201creasonably r elied upon the common definition\u201d of the term as referring to a matter that \nhas not been decided .  Id. at 2.  The agency contends that there is no ambiguity in the \nterm \u201cpending\u201d  and that an application is pending only after SBA completes an initial \nreview  of it.  MOL at  7.  In this regard, SBA had not performed the initial review of SAI\u2019s \nWOSB certification application as of the solicitation closing date and therefore had not \nmoved the application to pending status in DSBS.   See Protest, exh. 6, SBA WOSB \nApplication Status Letter December 2023 (indicating that SAI\u2019s application is in the initial \nscreening stage and awaiting review by SBA; that once the application is deemed complete, SAI\u2019s DSBS profile will be updated to pending.) . \n Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s requirements, we begin by examining the plain language of the solicitation.  Point Blank Enters., Inc. , B-411839, B -411839.2, \nNov. 4, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 345 at 4 .  If the solicitation language is unambiguous, our \ninquiry ceases.  Id.  An ambiguity, however, exists where two or more reasonable \ninterpretations of the solicitation are possible.  Colt Def., LLC , B-406696, July 24, 2012, \n2012 CPD \u00b6 302 at 8.  If the ambiguity is an obvious, gross, or glaring error in t he \nsolicitation then it is a patent ambiguity; a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.  That said, \neven where a solicitation contains an ambiguity, we will not sustain the protest unless \nthe protester demonstrates that it was competitively prejudiced by the ambiguous \nlanguage.  CW Constr. Servs & Materials, Inc., B -279724, July 15, 1998, 98- 2 CPD \u00b6 20 \nat 8-9.  In these instances, we examine the record to determine whether the offeror  Page 5 B-423359  would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage if it had the opportunity to \nrespond to the intended meaning.   Id.  \n Based on the record, we have no basis to sustain this protest ground.  Even if we were to agree with the protester that the term \u201cpending\u201d was ambiguous, the protester has not demonstrated that it was prejudiced by this ambiguity .  That is, the protester has not \nshown that , had it known the agency\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpending,\u201d  it would have \ntaken any action that would have given it a competitive advantage, such as preparing and submitting its application for WOSB certification earlier.   The protes ter instead \nargues only that it reasonably expected that DSBS would show its application as pending.  Comments at  2.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  \n SAI next argues that the agency should not have relied upon DSBS for verification concerning SAI\u2019s WOSB status  because \u201cthe data provided by DSBS has been shown \nto be unreliabl e.\u201d  Comments at  6.  We have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s use of \nDSBS because, as mentioned above,  FAR section 19.1505(e) expressly  provides that \nthe contracting officer is to  check DSBS to verify whether a firm has a pending \napplication for WOSB certification .  In the event that the offeror does not have a pending \ncertification in DSBS, the FAR mandates that the proposal \u201cshall be removed from \nconsideration.\u201d  FAR 19.1505(e)(2).  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  \n In its final challenge, SAI contends that the agency engaged in disparate treatment by  \neliminat ing SAI\u2019s proposal from the competition.   Comments  at 3-6; Supp. Protest \nat 3-4.  Specifically, SAI argues that \u201c[t]here are over 100 listed . . . WOSB awardees \nwith no certified or pending WOSB status in the SBA DSBS website. \u201d  Supp. Protest \nat 3.  The agency responds that it did not engage in disparate treatment and that all \ncontracts were awarded in accordance with the solicitation and applicable regulations.  \nSupp. MOL at  4. \n It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must \ntreat all offerors equally and evaluate their proposals evenhandedly against the solicitation\u2019s requirements and evaluation criteria.  CSRA LLC, B -417635 et al. , \nSept.  11, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 341 at 9; 22nd Century Techs., Inc. , B-417336, \nB-417336.2, May 24, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 198 at 6.  Where a protester alleges unequal \ntreatment, it must show that the differences in the evaluation did not stem from \ndifferences between the proposals.   Camber Corp. , B-413505, Nov. 10, 2016, 2016 \nCPD \u00b6 350 at  8.   \n We find no merit to SAI\u2019s argument that the agency engaged in disparate treatment .  As \nrelevant here, 13 C.F.R. 127.504(d)(1)(ii) provides:  \n \nFor a Multiple Award Contract that is set aside specifically for EDWOSB or \nWOSB, if a business concern is an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time of offer \nand contract -level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is an \nEDWOSB or WOSB for each order issued against the contract, unless a  Page 6 B-423359  contracting officer requests recertification as an EDWOSB or WOSB for a \nspecific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement.  \n In an email to the agency on September 24,  2024, SBA confirmed that a firm\u2019s eligibility \nfor participation in the WOSB set -aside is based on that firm\u2019s status \u201cat the time of \noffer.\u201d  AR, Tab 8, SBA Email at  2.  Any firm that was no longer WOSB -certified after \naward would be permitted to continue as  a WOSB in the procurement unless the \nagency requested recertification.  Id. ; see also 13 C.F.R.  127.504(d)(1)(ii).   Accordingly, \nSAI\u2019s argument that there are currently  \u201cover 100 companies \u201d without any WOSB \ncertification or pending status in DSBS , Supp. Protest at 3,  provides no basis to sustain \nits protest bec ause the applicable regulation requires firms to possess  WOSB \ncertification  only at the time of proposal submission.  13 C.F.R. 127.504(d)(1)(ii) .  \nAdditionally, SAI has not demonstrated disparate treatment as the agency consistently verified an offeror\u2019s WOSB status at the time of proposal submission.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

We have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s use of \nDSBS because, as mentioned above,  FAR section 19.1505(e) expressly  provides that \nthe contracting officer is to  check DSBS to verify whether a firm has a pending \napplication for WOSB certification .  In the event that the offeror does not have a pending \ncertification in DSBS, the FAR mandates that the proposal \u201cshall be removed from \nconsideration.\u201d  FAR 19.1505(e)(2).

This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   BACKGROUND  \n \nGSA issued the TOR on January 30, 2024, under the procedures of Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to holders of GSA \u2019s One Acquisition Solution for \nIntegrated Services (OASIS) small business indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) \ncontract pool 5B .1  Agency Report (AR), Exh.  3, TOR amend. 0009 (hereinafter TOR) \nat 1; Contracting Officer's Statement (COS) at 1.  The solicitation contemplated the \nissuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) \nfor the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and \nthe contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  \nTOR at 3.   \n The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to \ninclude  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and \nresponsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, \nproduction, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 4.  The solicitation provided for the \nevaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass\/fail basis), technical capability, and cost\/price.  Id.  at 60.  Award  was to be made \non a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of \nimportance.  Id.  The technical capability factor included the following two elements:  \ntask order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.  Id. at 61 -63.  The TOR explained that these two elements \u201c will not be \nindividually rated and are not subfactors ,\u201d but rather,  \u201c[t]hey are areas of emphasis for \nofferors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating. \u201d  \nId. at 60.    \n After the initial  evaluati on of  proposals , in May 2024 , GSA selected Credence for award.  \nProtest, exh. C, Notification of Award  (May 20, 2024 ) at 3.  Thereafter, another \nunsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response , the agency notified our Office \nof its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate proposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote R sch., Inc., B-422624, June 20, 2024 (unpublished).   As a result, \nour Office dismissed the protest as academic.   Id. \n Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of BTAS and Credence:\n2 \n \n1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-\naward IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a \nrequest for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead of quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do \nthe same.  \n2 The TOR explained that a single rating would be provided for each offeror under the \ntechnical capability factor based on the overall evaluation of the two elements.  TOR at 63.  The TOR also provided that technical capability would be evaluated as \nexceptional, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 64- 55.

Id. at 55.   For the task order management plan element , the \ncontracting officer  noted that BTAS received a weakness for it s risk mitigation table; the \nagency did not find any weaknesses in Credence\u2019s  technical approach.  Id.   Given the \nnoted strengths and lower evaluated price of Credence\u2019s proposal, the agency found \nthat C redence\u2019s proposal  represented the best value and issued the task order to that \nfirm for the total amount of $ 221,811,016.  Id.  at 55- 56, 58.  \n The agency notified BTAS on October 17, 2024, that its  proposal  had not been selected \nfor award.  Protest, exh. B, Notification of Award  (Oct. 17, 2024) at 3.   After requesting \nand receiving a debriefing,  which was completed on October 31,  BTAS  filed this protest \nwith our Office .\n3  Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 7. \n DISCUSSION  The protester raises two primary arguments:  (1) the a gency \u2019s cost  realism  evaluation \nimproperly failed to utilize the agency\u2019s independent government cost estimate (IGCE) \nand disregarded the solicitation\u2019s stated total evaluated price ( TEP) range in the \nevaluation of proposals, and therefore, there was no competition on a common basis ; \nand (2) the agency unreasonably failed to credit the protester\u2019s technical proposal with \nadditional strengths.   Protest at  15, 19- 22.  Based on our review of the record, we find \nthat none of the protester\u2019s arguments merit sustaining the protest .\n4 \n In reviewing protests of awards in task order competitions, we do not reevaluate proposals or quotations but examine the record to determine whether the evaluations and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation \u2019s \nevaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

Protest at 15.  Th e \nprotester contends that, as a result, the agency failed to evaluate proposals on a \ncommon basis.   Supp. Comments at 2.  For the reasons discussed below, we find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.  \n As relevant here, under the cost\/price factor, the solicitation provided that GSA would conduct \u201ccost\/price analysis to determine if the pricing is fair and reasonable ( i.e., \nwhether the proposed pricing is too high to endanger affordability and mission success) and for cost realism (i.e. , whether the pricing is so low that it endangers meeting the \nsolicitation\/PWS [Performance Work Statement]  requirements). \u201d  TOR at 66.   The TOR \nexplained that this analysis will include the \u201c methods described in FAR Subpart 15.4, \n\u2018Contract Pricing ,\u2019 and will encompass the pricing requirements noted in this solicitation \nSection 9.7, \u2018 Volume IV: Factor III -  Cost\/Price Information .\u2019\u201d\n5  Id.  In addition, the \nsolicitation included the following estimated range for the total evaluated price:  \n \nIt is estimated that the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for this task order will be between $275,000,000.00 and $336,000,000.00.  The TEP amount is the sum of the base and all option periods, and also includes pricing for the optional 6- month extension under FAR clause 52.217- 8, \u201cOption to \nExtend Services.\u201d  \nId. at 66.  As the agency further  explained in the d ebriefing,  \u201c[t]he TEP range was \nprovided to help the offerors gauge the magnitude of the requirement based upon the \nGovernment\u2019s best estimates at the time.\u201d  Protest, exh. A , Debriefing, Answer 3.  \n \nIn the protester\u2019s view, the TEP range was intended to provide offerors with  a \nbenchmark for cost\/price proposals.

The protester maintains that, because GSA failed to utilize the \nsolicitation\u2019s stated TEP range in the cost evaluation,  the award decision was fatally \nflawed because there was no competition on a common basis and the a gency failed to \nevaluate proposal s evenhandedly against the solicitation requirements.  Supp. \nComments at 2.  \n \nGSA responds that although the TOR included an estimated TEP range, the solicitation did not require that the agency use the TEP range or the IGCE  in its cost realism \nanalysis.  The agency asserts that its cost realism analysis reasonably complied with the solicitation requirements and was otherwise reasonable.   COS at  4. \n We find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  As noted above, the \nTOR informed offerors that GSA estimated the TEP to be between $275 million and $336 million.  TOR at 66.  It did not require TEPs to be within that estimated range to be \nconsidered realistic and reasonable.  Id.  An agency\u2019s inclusion of an estimate in a \nsolicitation does not constitute a requirement that offerors \u2019 TEPs  must exceed that \nestimate to be considered realistic.  See, e.g. , Rollout Sys., LLC, B -414145, Feb. 24, \n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 104 at 7- 8 (\u201cAlthough the protester argues that the Navy \nunreasonably failed to compare RMC\u2019s proposed costs to the significantly higher government estimate for the work, we have found reasonable an agency\u2019s cost realism evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposed costs, where the agency did not compare the awardee\u2019s costs to the government\u2019s estimate; rather, an agency is permitted to employ various types of analyses in determining an offeror\u2019s realistic cost to perform.\u201d) .  \nFurthermore, w here es timates are provided in a solicitation, there is no requirement that \nthey be absolutely correct; rather the estimates must be based on the best information available and present a reasonably accurate representation of the agency\u2019s anticipated needs.

Accordingly, \nto the extent the agency f ound that TEP s below the TEP range were realistic, the \nagency\u2019s evaluation did not contradict the terms of the TOR.\n6 \n \nIn addition, while BTAS also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to discard \nthe TEP range and the I GCE prepared for this competition, the record shows that the \nagency found that the IGCE was  too high.7  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 44.  In this regard, in \nconducting the cost realism analysis, the agency explained that \u201c[a]ll offers received \nwere under the IGCE between the ranges of 14 [percent]  and 32 [percent] .\u201d  Id.  The \nagency noted that the \u201cIGCE is generally found to be higher in value than proposed \noffers as its calculations do not assume or account for pricing discounts resulting from \ncompetition.\u201d  Id.  In addition, the agency explained that the IGCE was established using \n \n6 We also note that the record reflects that the protester\u2019s TEP of $259,381,250 was \nalso below the bottom of the TEP range.

Accordingly, w e are unpersuaded \nby the protester \u2019s arguments that the agency improperly dismissed or disregarded the \nTEP range or IGC E in its evaluation.  \n Ultimately, the record reflects that GSA analyzed each offeror\u2019s cost proposal, including \ndirect costs, escalation rate, indirect costs, and the technical evaluation board a nalysis \nof the w ork to be p erformed.

Although the protester asserts that the agency improperly failed to consider the \nTEP range or IGCE in its cost realism analysis , as referenced above, an agency \u2019s cost \nrealism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the methodology employed must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the rates proposed are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.  ATA Aerospace, LLC , \nB-417427.2, Mar. 6, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 96 at 5.  We find nothing unreasonable \nregarding the agency\u2019s evaluation here and the protester\u2019s disagreement with the \nevaluation, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate that the evaluation was unreasonable.  The protest ground is denied.  \n \n \n8 Ultimately, t he protester does not challenge any aspect of the agency\u2019s cost realism \nevaluation other than discussed herein.  As noted previously, although the protester initially also challenged other aspects of the agency\u2019s cost realism analysis, it later withdrew these arguments.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 2.  In addition, the protester also argue s for the first time in its supplemental protest  that by failing to utilize the \nsolicitation\u2019s stated TEP range in the evaluation of proposals, the agency  impermissibly \n\u201cchanged the evaluation scheme after receipt of proposals.\u201d  Id. at 6.  To the extent this \nallegation is distinct from the arguments in the initial protest, it is untimely  and will not be \nconsidered because the basis for the argument --that the TEP range was not considered \nin the agency\u2019s cost\/price evaluation--was known or should have been known based on information provided in the notification of award letter provided to BTAS  on October 17, \n2024, but the protester failed to file its protest within 10 days  of that date.

Protest \nat 19-22.  Specifically, BTAS argues  that its technical proposal warranted additional \nstrengths , including a significant strength,  because the agency initially assigned it \nmultiple strengths in the first iteration of the procurement.  Id.  In the protester\u2019s view, if \nthe additional strengths were assessed, its proposal would have been rated as \nexceptional , rather than good.   Id.  As discussed below, we find no merit to this \nargument.  \n Our Office has stated that the fact a reevaluation of proposals varies from the original evaluation does not constitute evidence that the reevaluation was unreasonable.

Absent a \nfactual or legal basis indicating why a reevaluation was improper, an agency is generally not required to explain differing evaluation results.  Id.

BTAS argues that the agency\u2019s evaluation of technical \nand cost proposals was unreasonable.  \n We deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-422624.2; B -422624.6   BACKGROUND  \n \nGSA issued the TOR on January 30, 2024, under the procedures of Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to holders of GSA \u2019s One Acquisition Solution for \nIntegrated Services (OASIS) small business indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) \ncontract pool 5B .1  Agency Report (AR), Exh.  3, TOR amend. 0009 (hereinafter TOR) \nat 1; Contracting Officer's Statement (COS) at 1.  The solicitation contemplated the \nissuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) \nfor the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and \nthe contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  \nTOR at 3.   \n The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to \ninclude  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and \nresponsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, \nproduction, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 4.  The solicitation provided for the \nevaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass\/fail basis), technical capability, and cost\/price.  Id.  at 60.  Award  was to be made \non a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of \nimportance.  Id.  The technical capability factor included the following two elements:  \ntask order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.  Id. at 61 -63.  The TOR explained that these two elements \u201c will not be \nindividually rated and are not subfactors ,\u201d but rather,  \u201c[t]hey are areas of emphasis for \nofferors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating. \u201d  \nId. at 60.    \n After the initial  evaluati on of  proposals , in May 2024 , GSA selected Credence for award.  \nProtest, exh. C, Notification of Award  (May 20, 2024 ) at 3.  Thereafter, another \nunsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response , the agency notified our Office \nof its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate proposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote R sch., Inc., B-422624, June 20, 2024 (unpublished).   As a result, \nour Office dismissed the protest as academic.   Id. \n Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of BTAS and Credence:\n2 \n \n1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-\naward IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a \nrequest for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead of quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do \nthe same.  \n2 The TOR explained that a single rating would be provided for each offeror under the \ntechnical capability factor based on the overall evaluation of the two elements.  TOR at 63.  The TOR also provided that technical capability would be evaluated as \nexceptional, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 64- 55.

Id. at 55.   For the task order management plan element , the \ncontracting officer  noted that BTAS received a weakness for it s risk mitigation table; the \nagency did not find any weaknesses in Credence\u2019s  technical approach.  Id.   Given the \nnoted strengths and lower evaluated price of Credence\u2019s proposal, the agency found \nthat C redence\u2019s proposal  represented the best value and issued the task order to that \nfirm for the total amount of $ 221,811,016.  Id.  at 55- 56, 58.  \n The agency notified BTAS on October 17, 2024, that its  proposal  had not been selected \nfor award.  Protest, exh. B, Notification of Award  (Oct. 17, 2024) at 3.   After requesting \nand receiving a debriefing,  which was completed on October 31,  BTAS  filed this protest \nwith our Office .\n3  Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 7. \n DISCUSSION  The protester raises two primary arguments:  (1) the a gency \u2019s cost  realism  evaluation \nimproperly failed to utilize the agency\u2019s independent government cost estimate (IGCE) \nand disregarded the solicitation\u2019s stated total evaluated price ( TEP) range in the \nevaluation of proposals, and therefore, there was no competition on a common basis ; \nand (2) the agency unreasonably failed to credit the protester\u2019s technical proposal with \nadditional strengths.   Protest at  15, 19- 22.  Based on our review of the record, we find \nthat none of the protester\u2019s arguments merit sustaining the protest .\n4 \n In reviewing protests of awards in task order competitions, we do not reevaluate proposals or quotations but examine the record to determine whether the evaluations and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation \u2019s \nevaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

Protest at 15.  Th e \nprotester contends that, as a result, the agency failed to evaluate proposals on a \ncommon basis.   Supp. Comments at 2.  For the reasons discussed below, we find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.  \n As relevant here, under the cost\/price factor, the solicitation provided that GSA would conduct \u201ccost\/price analysis to determine if the pricing is fair and reasonable ( i.e., \nwhether the proposed pricing is too high to endanger affordability and mission success) and for cost realism (i.e. , whether the pricing is so low that it endangers meeting the \nsolicitation\/PWS [Performance Work Statement]  requirements). \u201d  TOR at 66.   The TOR \nexplained that this analysis will include the \u201c methods described in FAR Subpart 15.4, \n\u2018Contract Pricing ,\u2019 and will encompass the pricing requirements noted in this solicitation \nSection 9.7, \u2018 Volume IV: Factor III -  Cost\/Price Information .\u2019\u201d\n5  Id.  In addition, the \nsolicitation included the following estimated range for the total evaluated price:  \n \nIt is estimated that the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for this task order will be between $275,000,000.00 and $336,000,000.00.  The TEP amount is the sum of the base and all option periods, and also includes pricing for the optional 6- month extension under FAR clause 52.217- 8, \u201cOption to \nExtend Services.\u201d  \nId. at 66.  As the agency further  explained in the d ebriefing,  \u201c[t]he TEP range was \nprovided to help the offerors gauge the magnitude of the requirement based upon the \nGovernment\u2019s best estimates at the time.\u201d  Protest, exh. A , Debriefing, Answer 3.  \n \nIn the protester\u2019s view, the TEP range was intended to provide offerors with  a \nbenchmark for cost\/price proposals.  In other words,  the protester asserts,  \u201ca proposed \ncost\/price above $336 million or below $275 million was at risk of rejection under [the \n \n5 This required, for example, that offerors provide information regarding indirect rates \n(including information about historical rates and a breakout of overhead, fringe, and general and administrative expenses), direct rates, fees, and subcontractors.

The protester maintains that, because GSA failed to utilize the \nsolicitation\u2019s stated TEP range in the cost evaluation,  the award decision was fatally \nflawed because there was no competition on a common basis and the a gency failed to \nevaluate proposal s evenhandedly against the solicitation requirements.  Supp. \nComments at 2.  \n \nGSA responds that although the TOR included an estimated TEP range, the solicitation did not require that the agency use the TEP range or the IGCE  in its cost realism \nanalysis.  The agency asserts that its cost realism analysis reasonably complied with the solicitation requirements and was otherwise reasonable.   COS at  4. \n We find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  As noted above, the \nTOR informed offerors that GSA estimated the TEP to be between $275 million and $336 million.  TOR at 66.  It did not require TEPs to be within that estimated range to be \nconsidered realistic and reasonable.  Id.  An agency\u2019s inclusion of an estimate in a \nsolicitation does not constitute a requirement that offerors \u2019 TEPs  must exceed that \nestimate to be considered realistic.  See, e.g. , Rollout Sys., LLC, B -414145, Feb. 24, \n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 104 at 7- 8 (\u201cAlthough the protester argues that the Navy \nunreasonably failed to compare RMC\u2019s proposed costs to the significantly higher government estimate for the work, we have found reasonable an agency\u2019s cost realism evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposed costs, where the agency did not compare the awardee\u2019s costs to the government\u2019s estimate; rather, an agency is permitted to employ various types of analyses in determining an offeror\u2019s realistic cost to perform.\u201d) .  \nFurthermore, w here es timates are provided in a solicitation, there is no requirement that \nthey be absolutely correct; rather the estimates must be based on the best information available and present a reasonably accurate representation of the agency\u2019s anticipated needs.  AeroSage, LLC , B-416381, Aug. 23, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6  288 at 11.   Accordingly, \nto the extent the agency f ound that TEP s below the TEP range were realistic, the \nagency\u2019s evaluation did not contradict the terms of the TOR.\n6 \n \nIn addition, while BTAS also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to discard \nthe TEP range and the I GCE prepared for this competition, the record shows that the \nagency found that the IGCE was  too high.7  AR, Exh. 2, ADM at 44.  In this regard, in \nconducting the cost realism analysis, the agency explained that \u201c[a]ll offers received \nwere under the IGCE between the ranges of 14 [percent]  and 32 [percent] .\u201d  Id.  The \nagency noted that the \u201cIGCE is generally found to be higher in value than proposed \noffers as its calculations do not assume or account for pricing discounts resulting from \ncompetition.\u201d  Id.  In addition, the agency explained that the IGCE was established using \n \n6 We also note that the record reflects that the protester\u2019s TEP of $259,381,250 was \nalso below the bottom of the TEP range.

As a result, the agency concluded that the \nmore appropriate consideration should be a comparison of the rates obtained through the instant competition to one another and to those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) .

Accordingly, w e are unpersuaded \nby the protester \u2019s arguments that the agency improperly dismissed or disregarded the \nTEP range or IGC E in its evaluation.  \n Ultimately, the record reflects that GSA analyzed each offeror\u2019s cost proposal, including \ndirect costs, escalation rate, indirect costs, and the technical evaluation board a nalysis \nof the w ork to be p erformed.

Although the protester asserts that the agency improperly failed to consider the \nTEP range or IGCE in its cost realism analysis , as referenced above, an agency \u2019s cost \nrealism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the methodology employed must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the rates proposed are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.  ATA Aerospace, LLC , \nB-417427.2, Mar. 6, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 96 at 5.  We find nothing unreasonable \nregarding the agency\u2019s evaluation here and the protester\u2019s disagreement with the \nevaluation, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate that the evaluation was unreasonable.  The protest ground is denied.  \n \n \n8 Ultimately, t he protester does not challenge any aspect of the agency\u2019s cost realism \nevaluation other than discussed herein.  As noted previously, although the protester initially also challenged other aspects of the agency\u2019s cost realism analysis, it later withdrew these arguments.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 2.  In addition, the protester also argue s for the first time in its supplemental protest  that by failing to utilize the \nsolicitation\u2019s stated TEP range in the evaluation of proposals, the agency  impermissibly \n\u201cchanged the evaluation scheme after receipt of proposals.\u201d  Id. at 6.  To the extent this \nallegation is distinct from the arguments in the initial protest, it is untimely  and will not be \nconsidered because the basis for the argument --that the TEP range was not considered \nin the agency\u2019s cost\/price evaluation--was known or should have been known based on information provided in the notification of award letter provided to BTAS  on October 17, \n2024, but the protester failed to file its protest within 10 days  of that date.

Protest \nat 19-22.  Specifically, BTAS argues  that its technical proposal warranted additional \nstrengths , including a significant strength,  because the agency initially assigned it \nmultiple strengths in the first iteration of the procurement.  Id.  In the protester\u2019s view, if \nthe additional strengths were assessed, its proposal would have been rated as \nexceptional , rather than good.   Id.  As discussed below, we find no merit to this \nargument.  \n Our Office has stated that the fact a reevaluation of proposals varies from the original evaluation does not constitute evidence that the reevaluation was unreasonable.

Absent a \nfactual or legal basis indicating why a reevaluation was improper, an agency is generally not required to explain differing evaluation results.  Id.  The overriding concern \nin our review of a reevaluation following corrective action is not whether the final evaluation is consistent with an earlier evaluation, but rather, whether it is reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.

        "Summary":"Agency\u2019s establishment of a noncompetitive logical follow -on task order was reasonable \npursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation subsection \n8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C).  \nDECISION  \n KoHealth Technologies, LLC, a small business of Richardson, Texas, protests a proposed sole- source task order extension to ICF Incorporated, LLC, of Reston, \nVirginia, by the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine,  for information technology modernization services \nrelated to the ClinicalTrials.gov website.  The protester alleges that the agency\u2019s justification for the sole- source task order is inadequate in various ways.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n In 2020, the agency initially issued a competitively awarded task order for operation, maintenance, and modernization of ClinicalTrials.gov to ICF under the General Services Administration \u2019s Federal Supply Schedule contract No. GS00F010CA.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1.  The period of performance for that contract ran from  \nSeptember  29, 2020, to Sept ember  28, 2023.  Id.  In 2023 the agency issued a \nsole-source follow -on task order for continuation of the modernization effort  with a 12- Page 2 B-423440  month period of performance and a single 6- month option that would collectively extend \nperformance to March 28, 2025.  Id.   Relevant to this protest, while this follow -on task \norder included Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.217 -8, Option to Extend \nServices, the agency did not evaluate pricing for that option.   Id. \n \nDuring the pendency of the follow -on task order the agency began conducting \nacquisition planning and market research to compete a follow -on procurement .  COS \nat 2.  Specifically, on August 27, 2024, the agency published sources sought notices \nand ultimately received capability statements from 49 firms, including the protester.  Id.   \nThe agency evaluated those capability statements and had additional communications with several firms, also including the protester.  Id.  \n Ultimately, however, because the ClinicalTrials.gov modernization effort was in its final phases with anticipated completion by the end of f iscal year 2025, the agency \nconcluded that transition to a new vendor would result in significant delay and additional costs.  Agency Report ( AR), Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 2, 6 -7.  For \nexample, the agency concluded, based on the responses to the sources sought not ices, \nthat a new vendor would require a 6 to 8-month transition period and the current \nmodernization phase would be completed within 6 months.  Id.   For this and other \nreasons , the agency concluded that  transitioning to a new vendor would result in delay \nof several time- sensitive deliverables , increased costs, and duplication of effort .  Id. \n While the agency continued with acquisition planning for the recompet ition of  the \nongoing operation and maintenance of  ClinicalTrials.gov, the agency concluded that it \nwould need to exercise the option to extend services provided by FAR clause 52.217- 8 \nfor six months to complete the current modernization effort .  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited \nSource Justification at 2- 3.  However, because the agency did not previously evaluate \nthe pricing for the option to extend services,  the exercise of that option is, in effect, a \nnew procurement .  Accordingly, the agency executed a limited sources justification \nrelying on FAR  subsection 8.405-6(a)(1) (i)(C), which provides that an agency may limit \nsources under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)  contract when:  \n \nIn the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow -\non to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The origi nal order or BPA [Blanket \nPurchase Agreement]  must not have been previously issued under sole-\nsource or limited- sources procedures.  \n \nThe protester filed an agency -level protest on March 7, 2025, arguing that the non-\ncompetitive extension of services was inappropriate because of alleged technical deficiencies in ICF\u2019s approach and alleged schedule failures in ICF\u2019s incumbent performance.   The agency denied this protest on March 26, and this protest followed.  \n  Page 3 B-423440  DISCUSSION \n The protester alleges that the agency\u2019s limited sources justification is inadequate in several respects.  The protester principally alleges that the agency\u2019s \u201cserial sole- source \nbridge [or interim] contracts\u201d are improper because the agency has had ample \nopportunity to plan a competitive recompete, and because \u201cprogram failure\u201d is an insufficient justification for a sole- source award.  Protest at 1.  In this regard, t he \nprotester further contends that the agency\u2019s market research was inadequate and failed \nto consider the strengths of KoHealth\u2019s capabilities statement .  Id. at 1-2.  Likewise , the \nprotester contends that the agency\u2019s conclusion that a new vendor could not transition in less than six months  was irrational.  Id.  at 2.\n1 \n \n \n1 The protester advances other collateral arguments not addressed in this decision.  We \nhave reviewed these arguments and conclude that they provide no basis to sustain the protest.  For example,  the protester argues in its comments on the agency report , for \nthe first time, that the agency\u2019s limited source justification was inappropriate because \nthe FAR subsection relied on by the agency, FAR 8.405 -6(a)(1)(i)(C), requires that it \nmay only be used to justify a follow on order when t he original order was not previously \nissued under sole- source or limited- sources procedures.   Protester\u2019s Comments at 2.  \nThe protester argues that, while the original order in this case was competitively awarded, the agency has already issued one non- competitive extension to that order, \nso the current order is, in effect, a follow on from a non- competitively awarded order.  Id.  \nFor the reasons outlined below, w e do not reach the merits of this argument because it \nis untimely .  \n Relevant here, the agency cited this FAR subsection in its limited sources justification , \nwhich was published on March 26, 2025.  See AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification \nat 4.  Indeed, this FAR subsection was the sole provision identified as \u201c [a]cquisition \nauthority\u201d in the limited sources justification and was also quoted in full.  Id.   \nAdditionally, also on March 26, the agency specifically cited this FAR subsection in its denial of the protester\u2019s agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 5.2, Agency -Level Protest \nResponse at 3.  Accordingly, the protester was on notice that the agency was relying on \nFAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to justify its limited source justification no later than \nMarch 26.  However, in its initial protest, the protester did not contend that this FAR subsection was inapplicable or inappropriate , and indeed did not cite or engage with the \nsubsection.  While the initial protest did contend that the agency\u2019s \u201cserial sole- source\u201d \norders were impermissible, the protest only argued that point on the basis of a lack of \nadvanced planning and alleged program failure.  See  Protest at 1.  While the protester  \nnow contends that it could not have known, prior to the agency report, that FAR \nsubsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) was central to the agency\u2019s limited sources justification, \nthat representation is inconsistent with the record.  \n Our decisions explain that the piecemeal presentation of evidence, information, or analysis supporting allegations previously made is prohibited.  Raytheon Blackbird \n(continued...)   Page 4 B-423440  In response, the agency argues that our O ffice has routinely concluded that a limited \nsources justification under the FSS is reasonably made in the interest of economy and \nefficiency  when it is based on documented concerns regarding disruption of service, \nduplication of effort, transition delays, or increased costs.

In this regard, the agency notes that its limited sources justification documents \nconcerns related to all of those factors.  MOL at 4-5. \n Similarly, concerning its market research, the agency notes that FAR subsection 8.405-\n6(a)(1)(i)(C) does not require an agency to exhaust all competitive options or conduct a \ndetailed comparative analysis.  Id.  at 5-6.  Rather , the FAR simply requires the agency  \nto document a description of market research conducted among schedule holders and \nthe results of that research or explain why market research could not be conducted.  \nSee FAR 8.405- 6(c)(2)(vi).  Here, the agency contends that it included such a statement \nin its limited source justification  and exceeded these requirements by conducting market \nresearch among both schedule holders and on the open market.  MOL at 5.  \n The FAR is clear that orders placed under the FSS are exempt from the competition requirements of FAR part 6.  FAR 8.405- 6.  Nevertheless, an agency must justify its \ndecision to issue an order on a noncompetitive basis.  Id.  Our Office will review an \nagency\u2019s use of a limited sources justification under FAR subpart 8.4, including a decision to issue a noncompetitive logical follow -on order pursuant to FAR  subsection \n8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C), for reasonableness.

Upon review of the record, we conclude that the agency\u2019s decision to issue the \naward to ICF  under these circumstances was reasonable.  \n The agency\u2019s position is simple and well -documented in the record.  The agency \nconcluded that changing contractors in the middle of an extremely complex project with impending deadlines poses unnecessary risk to both project schedule and cost.  Instead, permitting the incumbent, which is already immersed in the project and which possesses the requisite institutional knowledge to continue the work it began five years ago would conserve time and other resources, thus making the award to the incumbent an economical and efficient choice.

Rather, \nprotesters are obligated to set forth in their protest filings all of the known legal and factual grounds supporting their allegations because piecemeal presentation of evidence unnecessarily delays the procurement process and our ability to resolv e \nprotests within the 100 -day period statutorily mandated by the Competition in \nContracting Act.

Because the protester knew  or \nreasonably should have known that the agency relied on FAR subsection 8.405-\n6(a)(1) (i)(C) when it filed its initial protest, but only advanced arguments challenging the \nuse of that subsection in its comments on the agency report , more than a month later, \nwe dismiss this argument as an untimely piecemeal presentation of protest arguments.     Page 5 B-423440  at 2-7.  We have no basis to find the agency\u2019s considered judgments in this regard \nunreasonable.   \n We have consistently stated that an agency\u2019s limited sources justification is reasonably made in the interest of economy and efficiency where it is based upon documented concerns regarding disruption of service, duplication of efforts, transition delays, and\/or  \nincreased costs.   Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , supra, at 12 -13.  In this case, the \nagency credibly documented concerns regarding all of these factors in its limited source justification.   For example, the agency notes there is an ongoing migration of  users from \nthe previous system to the new system developed by ICF with users currently using both separate systems.  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 4- 5.  The agency \nreasonably concluded that transitioning to a new vendor during this migration would result in substantial delays, duplication of effort, inefficiency, and increased costs.  Id.  \nat 6-7.  The agency also explained that the modernization effort is in its final phase,  \nwhich the agency anticipates will be completed within the 6- month extension \ncontemplated by the limited sources justification.  Id.  \n Likewise , while the protester alleges that the agency conducted inadequate market \nresearch, the record does not support that argument.  Rather , the record confirms that \nthe agency solicit ed and review ed capabilities statements to determine if it could \npotentially make a transition to another vendor.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 3.5, Summary of \nCapabilit y Statement s Review.  Moreover , the agency documented its conclusions in its \nlimited source justification as required by FAR 8.405- 6.  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Sources \nJustification at 8- 11.  For example, t he agency explained that its market research \nidentified several vendors who could potentially meet the agency\u2019s long- term needs for \noperation and maintenance as part of a future competition, but the agency also \nconcluded that no vendor other than ICF would be able to meet the agency\u2019s near -term \nrequirements concerning the completion of the modernization effort  primarily because of \nthe time required for a new vendor to transition in.  Id.   The protester clearly disagrees \nwith the agency\u2019s conclusion but provides no substantive evidence to suggest that the agency\u2019s conclusions regarding the inefficiencies that would result from a near term transition are incorrect.  Moreover, w hile the protester would prefer that the agency had \nconducted a more searching comparison or analysis of its capabilities statement, \nFAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) does not impose such a burden on an agency.   \n To the contrary , a follow- on award is permissible under this authority if it is in the \ninterest of economy and efficiency, despite the existence of alternative acquisition strategies.  See Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , supra, at 14 n.13.  In this regard, there is \nno requirement that an agency consider competitive acquisition strategies prior to issuing a logical follow -on order.  Nor is there a requirement that an agency consider \nwhether the logical follow -on order is the most economical or efficient acquisi tion \nstrategy.  Id.  Thus , the question is not whether another strategy or another source \ncould satisfy the agency\u2019s needs, but whether the agency would likely conserve time and other resources by issuing the follow -on order.  Id.  In this case,  the agency\u2019s  Page 6 B-423440  conclusions that it would save time and money by issuing this 6 -month extension are \nboth reasonable and well -documented in the record.2 \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n2 In its initial protest the protester also argues that the risks of duplicative effort and \nschedule delays that the agency is currently seeking to mitigate are solely the result of \nthe incumbent\u2019s failure to deliver critical documentation, which represents a failure in acquisition planning on the agency\u2019 s part.  Protest at 2 -3.  In response, the agency \nexplain s that the prohibition on conducting a sole- source procurement due to a lack of \nadvance planning is found in FAR section 6.301(c)(1), but orders under the FSS are specifically exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, and a limited source justification fo r an FSS order must only satisfy the requirements of FAR section 8.405- 6.  \nMOL at 6 ( citing  FAR 8.405- 6).  Of note, FAR section 8.405- 6 does not include a \nprohibition on limited source justifications resulting from a lack of advance planning, and the agency contends that, under similar circumstances, our Office has dismissed challenges to agency  acquisition planning.

Rather the protester argues  that it is  challenging the \n\u201cconsequences\u201d of the agency\u2019s alleged planning failures.  Id.  Specifically, the protester \nrecast and reiterates its argument that the agency\u2019s use of FAR section 8.405- 6 was \nunsupported because this task order was not a follow on to a competitively awarded task order, and therefore the agency was required to satisfy the requirements of FAR part 6, which the agency did not do.  Id.  However, as discussed above, we dismissed \nthe protester\u2019s arguments that the task order was not a follow -on task order under FAR \nsubsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C)) as an untimely piecemeal presentation and found the \nagency\u2019s use of FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to be otherwise reasonable.  \nAccordingly , this reiterated but substantially similar argument is also dismissed.",

Wesser , Esq., Office of the \nGeneral Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.  \nDIGEST  \n \nAgency\u2019s establishment of a noncompetitive logical follow -on task order was reasonable \npursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation subsection \n8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C).  \nDECISION  \n KoHealth Technologies, LLC, a small business of Richardson, Texas, protests a proposed sole- source task order extension to ICF Incorporated, LLC, of Reston, \nVirginia, by the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine,  for information technology modernization services \nrelated to the ClinicalTrials.gov website.  The protester alleges that the agency\u2019s justification for the sole- source task order is inadequate in various ways.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n In 2020, the agency initially issued a competitively awarded task order for operation, maintenance, and modernization of ClinicalTrials.gov to ICF under the General Services Administration \u2019s Federal Supply Schedule contract No. GS00F010CA.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1.  The period of performance for that contract ran from  \nSeptember  29, 2020, to Sept ember  28, 2023.  Id.  In 2023 the agency issued a \nsole-source follow -on task order for continuation of the modernization effort  with a 12- Page 2 B-423440  month period of performance and a single 6- month option that would collectively extend \nperformance to March 28, 2025.  Id.   Relevant to this protest, while this follow -on task \norder included Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.217 -8, Option to Extend \nServices, the agency did not evaluate pricing for that option.   Id. \n \nDuring the pendency of the follow -on task order the agency began conducting \nacquisition planning and market research to compete a follow -on procurement .  COS \nat 2.  Specifically, on August 27, 2024, the agency published sources sought notices \nand ultimately received capability statements from 49 firms, including the protester.  Id.   \nThe agency evaluated those capability statements and had additional communications with several firms, also including the protester.  Id.  \n Ultimately, however, because the ClinicalTrials.gov modernization effort was in its final phases with anticipated completion by the end of f iscal year 2025, the agency \nconcluded that transition to a new vendor would result in significant delay and additional costs.  Agency Report ( AR), Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 2, 6 -7.  For \nexample, the agency concluded, based on the responses to the sources sought not ices, \nthat a new vendor would require a 6 to 8-month transition period and the current \nmodernization phase would be completed within 6 months.  Id.   For this and other \nreasons , the agency concluded that  transitioning to a new vendor would result in delay \nof several time- sensitive deliverables , increased costs, and duplication of effort .  Id. \n While the agency continued with acquisition planning for the recompet ition of  the \nongoing operation and maintenance of  ClinicalTrials.gov, the agency concluded that it \nwould need to exercise the option to extend services provided by FAR clause 52.217- 8 \nfor six months to complete the current modernization effort .  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited \nSource Justification at 2- 3.  However, because the agency did not previously evaluate \nthe pricing for the option to extend services,  the exercise of that option is, in effect, a \nnew procurement .  Accordingly, the agency executed a limited sources justification \nrelying on FAR  subsection 8.405-6(a)(1) (i)(C), which provides that an agency may limit \nsources under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)  contract when:  \n \nIn the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow -\non to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The origi nal order or BPA [Blanket \nPurchase Agreement]  must not have been previously issued under sole-\nsource or limited- sources procedures.  \n \nThe protester filed an agency -level protest on March 7, 2025, arguing that the non-\ncompetitive extension of services was inappropriate because of alleged technical deficiencies in ICF\u2019s approach and alleged schedule failures in ICF\u2019s incumbent performance.   The agency denied this protest on March 26, and this protest followed.  \n  Page 3 B-423440  DISCUSSION \n The protester alleges that the agency\u2019s limited sources justification is inadequate in several respects.  The protester principally alleges that the agency\u2019s \u201cserial sole- source \nbridge [or interim] contracts\u201d are improper because the agency has had ample \nopportunity to plan a competitive recompete, and because \u201cprogram failure\u201d is an insufficient justification for a sole- source award.  Protest at 1.  In this regard, t he \nprotester further contends that the agency\u2019s market research was inadequate and failed \nto consider the strengths of KoHealth\u2019s capabilities statement .  Id. at 1-2.  Likewise , the \nprotester contends that the agency\u2019s conclusion that a new vendor could not transition in less than six months  was irrational.  Id.  at 2.\n1 \n \n \n1 The protester advances other collateral arguments not addressed in this decision.  We \nhave reviewed these arguments and conclude that they provide no basis to sustain the protest.  For example,  the protester argues in its comments on the agency report , for \nthe first time, that the agency\u2019s limited source justification was inappropriate because \nthe FAR subsection relied on by the agency, FAR 8.405 -6(a)(1)(i)(C), requires that it \nmay only be used to justify a follow on order when t he original order was not previously \nissued under sole- source or limited- sources procedures.   Protester\u2019s Comments at 2.  \nThe protester argues that, while the original order in this case was competitively awarded, the agency has already issued one non- competitive extension to that order, \nso the current order is, in effect, a follow on from a non- competitively awarded order.  Id.  \nFor the reasons outlined below, w e do not reach the merits of this argument because it \nis untimely .  \n Relevant here, the agency cited this FAR subsection in its limited sources justification , \nwhich was published on March 26, 2025.  See AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification \nat 4.  Indeed, this FAR subsection was the sole provision identified as \u201c [a]cquisition \nauthority\u201d in the limited sources justification and was also quoted in full.  Id.   \nAdditionally, also on March 26, the agency specifically cited this FAR subsection in its denial of the protester\u2019s agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 5.2, Agency -Level Protest \nResponse at 3.  Accordingly, the protester was on notice that the agency was relying on \nFAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to justify its limited source justification no later than \nMarch 26.  However, in its initial protest, the protester did not contend that this FAR subsection was inapplicable or inappropriate , and indeed did not cite or engage with the \nsubsection.  While the initial protest did contend that the agency\u2019s \u201cserial sole- source\u201d \norders were impermissible, the protest only argued that point on the basis of a lack of \nadvanced planning and alleged program failure.  See  Protest at 1.  While the protester  \nnow contends that it could not have known, prior to the agency report, that FAR \nsubsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) was central to the agency\u2019s limited sources justification, \nthat representation is inconsistent with the record.  \n Our decisions explain that the piecemeal presentation of evidence, information, or analysis supporting allegations previously made is prohibited.  Raytheon Blackbird \n(continued...)   Page 4 B-423440  In response, the agency argues that our O ffice has routinely concluded that a limited \nsources justification under the FSS is reasonably made in the interest of economy and \nefficiency  when it is based on documented concerns regarding disruption of service, \nduplication of effort, transition delays, or increased costs.

Rather , the FAR simply requires the agency  \nto document a description of market research conducted among schedule holders and \nthe results of that research or explain why market research could not be conducted.  \nSee FAR 8.405- 6(c)(2)(vi).

Nevertheless, an agency must justify its \ndecision to issue an order on a noncompetitive basis.  Id.  Our Office will review an \nagency\u2019s use of a limited sources justification under FAR subpart 8.4, including a decision to issue a noncompetitive logical follow -on order pursuant to FAR  subsection \n8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C), for reasonableness.

Upon review of the record, we conclude that the agency\u2019s decision to issue the \naward to ICF  under these circumstances was reasonable.  \n The agency\u2019s position is simple and well -documented in the record.  The agency \nconcluded that changing contractors in the middle of an extremely complex project with impending deadlines poses unnecessary risk to both project schedule and cost.

Because the protester knew  or \nreasonably should have known that the agency relied on FAR subsection 8.405-\n6(a)(1) (i)(C) when it filed its initial protest, but only advanced arguments challenging the \nuse of that subsection in its comments on the agency report , more than a month later, \nwe dismiss this argument as an untimely piecemeal presentation of protest arguments.     Page 5 B-423440  at 2-7.  We have no basis to find the agency\u2019s considered judgments in this regard \nunreasonable.   \n We have consistently stated that an agency\u2019s limited sources justification is reasonably made in the interest of economy and efficiency where it is based upon documented concerns regarding disruption of service, duplication of efforts, transition delays, and\/or  \nincreased costs.   Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC , supra, at 12 -13.  In this case, the \nagency credibly documented concerns regarding all of these factors in its limited source justification.   For example, the agency notes there is an ongoing migration of  users from \nthe previous system to the new system developed by ICF with users currently using both separate systems.  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Source Justification at 4- 5.  The agency \nreasonably concluded that transitioning to a new vendor during this migration would result in substantial delays, duplication of effort, inefficiency, and increased costs.  Id.  \nat 6-7.  The agency also explained that the modernization effort is in its final phase,  \nwhich the agency anticipates will be completed within the 6- month extension \ncontemplated by the limited sources justification.  Id.  \n Likewise , while the protester alleges that the agency conducted inadequate market \nresearch, the record does not support that argument.  Rather , the record confirms that \nthe agency solicit ed and review ed capabilities statements to determine if it could \npotentially make a transition to another vendor.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 3.5, Summary of \nCapabilit y Statement s Review.  Moreover , the agency documented its conclusions in its \nlimited source justification as required by FAR 8.405- 6.  AR, Tab 4.3, Limited Sources \nJustification at 8- 11.  For example, t he agency explained that its market research \nidentified several vendors who could potentially meet the agency\u2019s long- term needs for \noperation and maintenance as part of a future competition, but the agency also \nconcluded that no vendor other than ICF would be able to meet the agency\u2019s near -term \nrequirements concerning the completion of the modernization effort  primarily because of \nthe time required for a new vendor to transition in.

In this regard, there is \nno requirement that an agency consider competitive acquisition strategies prior to issuing a logical follow -on order.  Nor is there a requirement that an agency consider \nwhether the logical follow -on order is the most economical or efficient acquisi tion \nstrategy.  Id.  Thus , the question is not whether another strategy or another source \ncould satisfy the agency\u2019s needs, but whether the agency would likely conserve time and other resources by issuing the follow -on order.  Id.  In this case,  the agency\u2019s  Page 6 B-423440  conclusions that it would save time and money by issuing this 6 -month extension are \nboth reasonable and well -documented in the record.2 \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n2 In its initial protest the protester also argues that the risks of duplicative effort and \nschedule delays that the agency is currently seeking to mitigate are solely the result of \nthe incumbent\u2019s failure to deliver critical documentation, which represents a failure in acquisition planning on the agency\u2019 s part.

Rather the protester argues  that it is  challenging the \n\u201cconsequences\u201d of the agency\u2019s alleged planning failures.  Id.  Specifically, the protester \nrecast and reiterates its argument that the agency\u2019s use of FAR section 8.405- 6 was \nunsupported because this task order was not a follow on to a competitively awarded task order, and therefore the agency was required to satisfy the requirements of FAR part 6, which the agency did not do.  Id.  However, as discussed above, we dismissed \nthe protester\u2019s arguments that the task order was not a follow -on task order under FAR \nsubsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C)) as an untimely piecemeal presentation and found the \nagency\u2019s use of FAR subsection 8.405- 6(a)(1)(i)(C) to be otherwise reasonable.  \nAccordingly , this reiterated but substantially similar argument is also dismissed.  \n "

        "Summary":"Protest challenging agency\u2019s evaluation of protestor\u2019s past performance is denied where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  \nDECISION  \n Sheela Inc., a small business, of Wrightstown, New Jersey protests the awards of six contracts, under request for proposals (RFP) No.  FA448424R0017, issued by the \nDepartment of the Air Force, for design- build and construction projects at Joint Base \nMcGuire  Dix Lakehurst (JBMDL), New Jersey.  The protester contends that Sheela \nshould have received an award had the agency reasonably evaluated its past performance.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n \nOn September 5, 2024, the Air Force issued the solicitation, as a small business \nset-aside, for an indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity multiple award construction \ncontract (MACC), pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 and subpart  36.3.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, RFP at 1; Contracting Officer Statement \n(COS) at 2.  The agency sought proposals for the execution of a broad range of design-build and construction projects at JBMDL, with award based on offerors\u2019 responses to the solicitation\u2019s \u201cseed\u201d project.  RFP at 54, 56.  The seed project was to provide partial design- build for the conversion of a dorm room into a new common area kitchenette for \nbuilding 821.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 1; AR Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 61.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423412   \nThe solicitation contemplated award of five--but reserved the right to award more--MACCs for one base year and six 1- year option periods .  RFP at 207.  Award would be \nmade on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering the following factors:  price and past \nperformance.  Id. at 207.  Past performance was significantly more important than \nprice.\n1  Offers would be ranked according to the proposed seed project price.  Id. \nat 208.  The solicitation explained:   \n \nIf the lowest five (5) priced offerors were not determined to have a \u201cSubstantial Confidence\u201d performance confidence assessment, the next five (5) lowest priced offerors would be evaluated, and the process would continue (in order by price) until a target of five (5) offerors were determined to have a \u201cSubstantial Confidence\u201d performance assessment, or until all offerors re -evaluated.  \n Id.   \n The agency received 25 proposals by the solicitation\u2019s October 21, deadline.  COS at 3.  Sheela was ranked the sixth lowest -priced offer, with a total evaluated price of \n$109,792.62.  AR, Tab 20, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 30.  After evaluating the protester\u2019s past performance references, the agency assigned Sheela a confidence rating of \u201climited confidence.\u201d  AR, Tab 21, Source Selection Decision at 3.   \n On March 12, 2025, the Air Force awarded MACCs to six offerors.\n2  COS at 8.  On the \nsame day, the Air Force notified Sheela that it was an unsuccessful offeror.  AR, Tab 22, Unsuccessful Offeror Letter at 2.  Sheela requested and received a written \ndebriefing on March 13.  AR, Tab 23, Debrief at 1.  This protest follow ed on March 24.  \n DISCUSSION  Sheela raises multiple challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the firm\u2019s proposal.  The protestor contends the Air Force\u2019s evaluation of its past performance was unreasonable because the agency relied solely upon one negative Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) report and failed to consider the protestor\u2019s \nrebuttal of the negative CPARS report.  Protest at 2- 3.  Additionally, the protester \n \n1 Past performance would be evaluated and assigned one of the following confidence \nassessment ratings:  substantial confidence, satisfactory confidence, neutral \nconfidence, limited confidence, or no confidence.  RFP at 209- 210. \n2 The awardees are:  FBSG -GForce, Norristown, Pennsylvania; Ranco Construction Inc, \nSouthampton, New Jersey; Benaka Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey; Eastern Construction, Wrightstown, New Jersey; Kaser Mechanical, LLC, Burlington, New Jersey; and Ritz Const ruction, Inc., Frederick, Maryland.  AR, Tab 22, Unsuccessful \nOfferor Letter at 2.   Page 3 B-423412  asserts that the Air Force\u2019s decision to amend the solicitation after submission of \nproposals was improper.  Comments at 4- 5.  We have considered all the protester\u2019s \narguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  \n Past Performance Evaluation  \n Sheela challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the firm\u2019s past performance.  Protest at 2.  According to Sheela, the agency improperly relied on a single negative CPARS report instead of more relevant CPARS reports with positive trends.  Id.   The agency responds \nthat, consistent with the solicitation, the past performance evaluation was reasonable given Sheela\u2019s marginal and unsatisfactory evaluations on recent and relevant CPARS reports.  MOL at 5.  \n  CPARS  \n An agency\u2019s evaluation of past performance, which includes its consideration of the significance of an offeror\u2019s performance history, is a matter of discretion, which we will not disturb unless the assessment is unreasonable or inconsistent with the solici tation \ncriteria.  CIMA JV, et al. , B-422813 et al. , Oct. 28, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 261 at 6.  When a \nprotester challenges an agency\u2019s past performance evaluation, we will review the evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitati on\u2019s \nevaluation criteria as well as applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id.  The \nevaluation of past performance, by its very nature, is subjective, and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based evaluation findings.  Intercontinental Constr. Contracting, Inc. , B-415040 et al. , Nov. 8, 2017, 2018 CPD \u00b6 82 at 7.  A \nprotester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  APC Constr., LLC, B -419771, July 13, 2021, \n2021 CPD \u00b6 258 at 6.  \n The solicitation instructed offerors to provide \u201ca list of no more than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last five (5) years.\u201d  RFP at 204.  The Air Force would evaluate the quality  of an offeror\u2019s \nperformance based on the recency and relevance of past performance information.  Id.  \nat 209.  Further, the RFP advised that the agency\u2019s evaluation would be based not only on the performance references submitted by the offeror, but \u201cany ot her sources of \ninformation available to the Government to assess present\/past performance.\u201d  Id.  \nat 204.   \n Here, in evaluating the protester\u2019s past performance, the agency accessed 28 recent CPARS reports for Sheela and reviewed the following categories for each report:  quality, schedule, cost control, management, small business subcontracting, and regulatory compliance.  COS at 5 -6.  The agency noted, across the categories for these \nreports, Sheela received three \u201cmarginal\u201d ratings and one \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating.  Id. ; \nAR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at 1.  Three of the negative ratings were as sessed to Sheela\u2019s performance on contract No. 47PC0220D0009.  AR, Tab 16, \nCPARS Reports at 1.  The contract was for cyclical upgrades to judge\u2019s chambers,  Page 4 B-423412  which included tasks such as providing new carpeting, painting, wallcovering, wood \nrefinishing, and floor mastic abatement remediation.  Id .  The protester received a rating \nof marginal under the schedule category, and the CPARS report indicated Sheela had \u201con many occasions\u201d failed to provide a workable schedule, did not complete the project on time, and quality deficiencies led the government to issuing three extensions.  Id. \nat 3.   \n Sheela also received a rating of marginal in the regulatory compliance category \nbecause of the firm\u2019s \u201cmultiple failures to comply with [ Homeland Security Presidential \nDirective 12 ] requirements, and also failure to comply with [New York City] regulations \nfor asbestos abatement work.\u201d  Id. at 8-9.  Finally, Sheela received a rating of \nunsatisfactory under the management category because, among other things, there were \u201cnumerous communications issues, lack of supervision on site and many coordination issues were present during the performance of this contract due to poor management.\u201d  Id. at 5-8.  Ultimately, these negative assessments led the contracting \nofficer for the report to not recommend Sheela for similar work in the future.  Id. at 9. \n The last negative rating was found in the CPARS report for contract No. FA448420D0002.  Id.  at 13.  This contract was valued at $90,000,000 and was for work \nSheela performed as an incumbent on the prior MACC.  Id.   Sheela received a rating of \nmarginal under the management category for lack of supervision on the jobsite and other delays attributable to the contractor.  Id. at 16.  Based on this recent and relevant \nperformance history, the evaluators concluded that Sheela\u2019s past performance record supported \u201c a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage \nseveral task orders at the same time and successfully perform similar magnitudes \ndescribed in the solicitation.\u201d  MOL at 7.  \n Sheela does not dispute that the agency could consider CPARS ratings for past performance, nor does the protester dispute that the CPARS include the discussed negative assessments.  See  Comments at 1 -2.  Instead, the protestor argues that the \nagency unreasonably gave too much weight to a single negative CPARS report and effectively ignored multiple CPARS reports with positive outcomes.  Protest at 2 (\u201cThe agency\u2019s reliance on one single CPARS report was unreasonable in light of Sheela\u2019s multiple more recent , favorable CPARS . . .\u201d).  Contrary to the protester\u2019s contentions, \nthe evaluation record demonstrates otherwise.   \n As the record makes clear, Sheela\u2019s negative performance ratings were found in two separate CPARS reports, not one as the protester suggests.  More importantly, the record reflects that the agency reviewed not only the 28 CPARS reports pulled for Sheela, but the evaluators also reviewed the three past performance questionnaires (PPQ) submitted with Sheela\u2019s proposal.  AR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at  1-4.  Ultimately, the evaluators concluded:  \n \nThe past performance provided for [Sheela] referenced essentially the same scope, magnitude and complexity to the effort described in the solicitation, resulting in three \u201cVery Relevant\u201d ratings.  However, when  Page 5 B-423412  considering the ratings of the past performance submitted via PPQs as \nmerely Satisfactory performance with no elaboration in value- add to the \nGovernment, and the several CPARS with very concerning performance ratings of Marginal and Unsatisfactory, the quality of [Sheela performance] is low.  As a result, a Limited Confidence rating is being assigned to \n[Sheela] as the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage several task orders at the same time and successfully  perform similar magnitudes described in the solicitation.  \n Id. at 3. \n In other words, the agency considered both the protester\u2019s positive and negative CPARS reports in assigning Sheela a rating of \u201climited confidence.\u201d  Sheela disagrees with the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation based on the protestor\u2019s own judgment about  the weight that should be assigned to these performance reviews.  See  \nComments at 2.  While the protestor takes issue with the agency\u2019s conclusion, this disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation judgments, without more, does not demonstrate that those judgements were unreasonable or otherwise provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.  APC Constr., LLC, supra.  As such, we find no basis to \nobject to the agency\u2019s evaluation, and this allegation is denied.   \nCPARS Rebuttal  \n Further, the protester argues that, under FAR section 42.1503(d), the agency was required--and failed--to consider Sheela\u2019s rebuttal to its negative CPARS report when \nevaluating the firm\u2019s past performance.  Protest at 2.  The agency responds that FAR \nsection 42.1503(d) does not apply to the evaluations of offerors\u2019 proposals and that, \nnonetheless, the Air Force did consider the CPARS rebuttal in the evaluation of Sheela\u2019s past performance.  MOL at 7- 8. \n Relevant here, section 42.1503(d) of the FAR provides:  \n \nContractors shall be afforded up to 14 calendar days from the date of notification of availability of the past performance evaluation to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information.  Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation.  The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. . . . These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions[.]  \n FAR 42.1503(d).  As the agency explains, the FAR provision does not govern the evaluation of an offeror\u2019s past performance but, instead, pertains to the government\u2019s \u201cevaluation of a contractor\u2019s performance of a [completed] contract and documenting that evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance for use in future source selections.\u201d  MOL at 7.  We agree.   Page 6 B-423412   \nSubpart 42.12 of the FAR \u201cprovides policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining contractor performance information.\u201d  FAR 42.1500.  While the subpart acknowledges that \u201c[p]ast performance information (including the ratings and supporting narratives) is relevant information for future source selection purposes,\u201d nothing in the provision imposes any requirement with regards to what the agency must do with the information provided in a CPARS report.  FAR 42.1501(a); see generally  \nFAR 42.15.   \n Nonetheless, even if the FAR provision afforded the protester some substantive right with regards to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Sheela\u2019s past performance--which it does not--the record reflects that the evaluators were aware of Sheela\u2019s rebuttal to the \nnegative CPARS report during the agency\u2019s evaluation.   MOL at 7 (\u201c[T]he Air Force was \naware of Sheela\u2019s response to its poor past performance ratings.\u201d); AR, Tab 20, SSEB Report at 28.  Where, as here, an agency has considered reasonably available and relevant past performance information, its judgments regarding the relative merits of competing offerors\u2019 past performance are primarily matters within the contracting agency\u2019s discretion.  TPMC -Energy Solutions Envtl. Servs. 2009, LLC , B-408343.2 et \nal., Aug. 23, 2013, 2013 \u00b6 215 at  8.  Given this record, we have no basis to conclude \nthat the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable or otherwise improper.  \n Remaining Challenges  \n Finally, the protester raises two new arguments for the first time in its comments to the \nagency report.   First, the protester alleges that the Air Force engaged in \u201ca pattern of \nunfair treatment\u201d against Sheela.  Comments at 4.  The protester\u2019s only support for this assertion is that the Air Force did not select it for award in three prior unrelated procurements and that it has \u201cwitnesses who will testify\u201d to the allegedly unfair treatment Sheela has suffered at the hands of unidentified individuals at the Air Force.  Id.    \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2;  K&K Industries, Inc. , B-420422, B -420422.2, Mar.  7, 2022, 2022 CPD \n\u00b6 62 at  4.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity \nto present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.  Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, \n2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 260 at 4.  Our  regulations make clear  that protests other  than those \nchallenging the terms of the solicitation must be filed within 10 days of when a protester \nknew, or should have known, of its basis for protest.  4  C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(2).  Where a \nprotester initially files a timely protest, and later supplements it with independent grounds of protest, the later -raised allegations must independently satisfy the timeliness \nrequirements, since our r egulations do not contemplate the unwarranted piecemeal \npresentation or development of protest issues.  Savvee Consulting, Inc. , B-408416.3, \nMar. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 92 at 5.   \n Here, the protester knew the operative facts underlying this allegation prior to its initial protest , i.e., its non- selection on three prior procurements .  Thus, the information upon  Page 7 B-423412  which the protester based its new allegation in its comments w as known or should have \nbeen known prior to the filing of Sheela\u2019s initial protest.  As we explained, our \nregulations do not contemplate the piecemeal presentation or development of protest \nissues through later submissions citing examples or providing alternate or more specific \nlegal arguments missing from earlier general allegations of impropriety .  Id.  Because \nthe protester waited until its comments to raise this new argument --which could have \nbeen raised in its initial protest --it is untimely and will not be considered.3  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(2); Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec. 18, 2019, 2020 CPD \u00b6 8 \nat 11 n.13.  \n \nSecond, the protester alleges, also for the first time in its comments, that the agency\u2019s \n\u201cdecision to amend the evaluation process after the submission of proposals without \naffording offerors the opportunity to review their submissions\u201d deprived the firm of \u201cthe \nchance to adjust its submiss ion to meet any new or clarified administrative \nrequirements.\u201d  Comments at 4- 5.  We find this allegation also to be untimely.   \n Here, the solicitation was amended three times prior to the November 12 deadline for submission of proposals.  COS at  3; AR, Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 1.  On December 31, \nthe agency issued amendment 4, notifying all offerors that submitted proposals by the November  12 due date.  AR, Tab 18, Amendment 4 at 1; COS at 3.  Amendment 4 did \nnot extend the due date for the submission of proposals or otherwise allow for submission of proposal revisions.   \n \nOur regulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation \nwhich are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals \nshall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.   4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(1).  Where alleged improprieties do not exist in the initial solicitation, but \nsubsequently occur ( e.g., via an amendment to the solicitation), they generally must be \nprotested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals. Id .; ODL Servs. , \nB-421537 et al. , May 25, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 130 at 6.  I f no further submissions are \nanticipated, any alleged solicitation improprieties must be protested within 10 days of \nwhen the alleged impropriety was known or should have been known.   4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(1).  Because the time set for receipt of proposals had passed, Sheela was \nrequired to file any protest challenging the amended terms of the solicitation not later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of  the basis of \nthe protest --which would have been January 10, 2025.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1); ODL  \n  \n \n3 Because we find the argument to be untimely, we need not address whether Sheela\u2019s \nbare assertion states a factually and legally sufficient basis of protest, as required by our regulations .  See  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.1(c)(4) and (f) .    Page 8 B-423412  Servs. , B-421537 et al., supra.  Consequently, this allegation is similarly dismissed as \nuntimely.    \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Couns el",

CIMA JV, et al. , B-422813 et al. , Oct. 28, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 261 at 6.  When a \nprotester challenges an agency\u2019s past performance evaluation, we will review the evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitati on\u2019s \nevaluation criteria as well as applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id.  The \nevaluation of past performance, by its very nature, is subjective, and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based evaluation findings.  Intercontinental Constr. Contracting, Inc. , B-415040 et al. , Nov. 8, 2017, 2018 CPD \u00b6 82 at 7.  A \nprotester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  APC Constr., LLC, B -419771, July 13, 2021, \n2021 CPD \u00b6 258 at 6.  \n The solicitation instructed offerors to provide \u201ca list of no more than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last five (5) years.\u201d  RFP at 204.  The Air Force would evaluate the quality  of an offeror\u2019s \nperformance based on the recency and relevance of past performance information.  Id.  \nat 209.  Further, the RFP advised that the agency\u2019s evaluation would be based not only on the performance references submitted by the offeror, but \u201cany ot her sources of \ninformation available to the Government to assess present\/past performance.\u201d  Id.  \nat 204.   \n Here, in evaluating the protester\u2019s past performance, the agency accessed 28 recent CPARS reports for Sheela and reviewed the following categories for each report:  quality, schedule, cost control, management, small business subcontracting, and regulatory compliance.  COS at 5 -6.  The agency noted, across the categories for these \nreports, Sheela received three \u201cmarginal\u201d ratings and one \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating.  Id. ; \nAR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at 1.  Three of the negative ratings were as sessed to Sheela\u2019s performance on contract No. 47PC0220D0009.  AR, Tab 16, \nCPARS Reports at 1.  The contract was for cyclical upgrades to judge\u2019s chambers,  Page 4 B-423412  which included tasks such as providing new carpeting, painting, wallcovering, wood \nrefinishing, and floor mastic abatement remediation.  Id .  The protester received a rating \nof marginal under the schedule category, and the CPARS report indicated Sheela had \u201con many occasions\u201d failed to provide a workable schedule, did not complete the project on time, and quality deficiencies led the government to issuing three extensions.  Id. \nat 3.   \n Sheela also received a rating of marginal in the regulatory compliance category \nbecause of the firm\u2019s \u201cmultiple failures to comply with [ Homeland Security Presidential \nDirective 12 ] requirements, and also failure to comply with [New York City] regulations \nfor asbestos abatement work.\u201d  Id. at 8-9.  Finally, Sheela received a rating of \nunsatisfactory under the management category because, among other things, there were \u201cnumerous communications issues, lack of supervision on site and many coordination issues were present during the performance of this contract due to poor management.\u201d  Id. at 5-8.  Ultimately, these negative assessments led the contracting \nofficer for the report to not recommend Sheela for similar work in the future.  Id. at 9. \n The last negative rating was found in the CPARS report for contract No. FA448420D0002.  Id.  at 13.  This contract was valued at $90,000,000 and was for work \nSheela performed as an incumbent on the prior MACC.  Id.   Sheela received a rating of \nmarginal under the management category for lack of supervision on the jobsite and other delays attributable to the contractor.  Id. at 16.  Based on this recent and relevant \nperformance history, the evaluators concluded that Sheela\u2019s past performance record supported \u201c a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage \nseveral task orders at the same time and successfully perform similar magnitudes \ndescribed in the solicitation.\u201d  MOL at 7.  \n Sheela does not dispute that the agency could consider CPARS ratings for past performance, nor does the protester dispute that the CPARS include the discussed negative assessments.  See  Comments at 1 -2.  Instead, the protestor argues that the \nagency unreasonably gave too much weight to a single negative CPARS report and effectively ignored multiple CPARS reports with positive outcomes.  Protest at 2 (\u201cThe agency\u2019s reliance on one single CPARS report was unreasonable in light of Sheela\u2019s multiple more recent , favorable CPARS . . .\u201d).  Contrary to the protester\u2019s contentions, \nthe evaluation record demonstrates otherwise.   \n As the record makes clear, Sheela\u2019s negative performance ratings were found in two separate CPARS reports, not one as the protester suggests.  More importantly, the record reflects that the agency reviewed not only the 28 CPARS reports pulled for Sheela, but the evaluators also reviewed the three past performance questionnaires (PPQ) submitted with Sheela\u2019s proposal.  AR, Tab 19, Sheela Past Performance Evaluation at  1-4.  Ultimately, the evaluators concluded:  \n \nThe past performance provided for [Sheela] referenced essentially the same scope, magnitude and complexity to the effort described in the solicitation, resulting in three \u201cVery Relevant\u201d ratings.  However, when  Page 5 B-423412  considering the ratings of the past performance submitted via PPQs as \nmerely Satisfactory performance with no elaboration in value- add to the \nGovernment, and the several CPARS with very concerning performance ratings of Marginal and Unsatisfactory, the quality of [Sheela performance] is low.  As a result, a Limited Confidence rating is being assigned to \n[Sheela] as the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform and manage several task orders at the same time and successfully  perform similar magnitudes described in the solicitation.  \n Id. at 3. \n In other words, the agency considered both the protester\u2019s positive and negative CPARS reports in assigning Sheela a rating of \u201climited confidence.\u201d  Sheela disagrees with the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation based on the protestor\u2019s own judgment about  the weight that should be assigned to these performance reviews.  See  \nComments at 2.  While the protestor takes issue with the agency\u2019s conclusion, this disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation judgments, without more, does not demonstrate that those judgements were unreasonable or otherwise provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.  APC Constr., LLC, supra.  As such, we find no basis to \nobject to the agency\u2019s evaluation, and this allegation is denied.   \nCPARS Rebuttal  \n Further, the protester argues that, under FAR section 42.1503(d), the agency was required--and failed--to consider Sheela\u2019s rebuttal to its negative CPARS report when \nevaluating the firm\u2019s past performance.  Protest at 2.  The agency responds that FAR \nsection 42.1503(d) does not apply to the evaluations of offerors\u2019 proposals and that, \nnonetheless, the Air Force did consider the CPARS rebuttal in the evaluation of Sheela\u2019s past performance.  MOL at 7- 8. \n Relevant here, section 42.1503(d) of the FAR provides:  \n \nContractors shall be afforded up to 14 calendar days from the date of notification of availability of the past performance evaluation to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information.  Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation.  The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. . . . These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions[.]  \n FAR 42.1503(d).  As the agency explains, the FAR provision does not govern the evaluation of an offeror\u2019s past performance but, instead, pertains to the government\u2019s \u201cevaluation of a contractor\u2019s performance of a [completed] contract and documenting that evaluation of the contractor\u2019s performance for use in future source selections.\u201d  MOL at 7.  We agree.   Page 6 B-423412   \nSubpart 42.12 of the FAR \u201cprovides policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining contractor performance information.\u201d  FAR 42.1500.  While the subpart acknowledges that \u201c[p]ast performance information (including the ratings and supporting narratives) is relevant information for future source selection purposes,\u201d nothing in the provision imposes any requirement with regards to what the agency must do with the information provided in a CPARS report.  FAR 42.1501(a); see generally  \nFAR 42.15.   \n Nonetheless, even if the FAR provision afforded the protester some substantive right with regards to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Sheela\u2019s past performance--which it does not--the record reflects that the evaluators were aware of Sheela\u2019s rebuttal to the \nnegative CPARS report during the agency\u2019s evaluation.   MOL at 7 (\u201c[T]he Air Force was \naware of Sheela\u2019s response to its poor past performance ratings.\u201d); AR, Tab 20, SSEB Report at 28.  Where, as here, an agency has considered reasonably available and relevant past performance information, its judgments regarding the relative merits of competing offerors\u2019 past performance are primarily matters within the contracting agency\u2019s discretion.  TPMC -Energy Solutions Envtl. Servs. 2009, LLC , B-408343.2 et \nal., Aug. 23, 2013, 2013 \u00b6 215 at  8.  Given this record, we have no basis to conclude \nthat the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable or otherwise improper.  \n Remaining Challenges  \n Finally, the protester raises two new arguments for the first time in its comments to the \nagency report.   First, the protester alleges that the Air Force engaged in \u201ca pattern of \nunfair treatment\u201d against Sheela.  Comments at 4.  The protester\u2019s only support for this assertion is that the Air Force did not select it for award in three prior unrelated procurements and that it has \u201cwitnesses who will testify\u201d to the allegedly unfair treatment Sheela has suffered at the hands of unidentified individuals at the Air Force.  Id.    \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2;  K&K Industries, Inc. , B-420422, B -420422.2, Mar.  7, 2022, 2022 CPD \n\u00b6 62 at  4.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity \nto present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.  Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, \n2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 260 at 4.  Our  regulations make clear  that protests other  than those \nchallenging the terms of the solicitation must be filed within 10 days of when a protester \nknew, or should have known, of its basis for protest.  4  C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(2).  Where a \nprotester initially files a timely protest, and later supplements it with independent grounds of protest, the later -raised allegations must independently satisfy the timeliness \nrequirements, since our r egulations do not contemplate the unwarranted piecemeal \npresentation or development of protest issues.  Savvee Consulting, Inc. , B-408416.3, \nMar. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 92 at 5.   \n Here, the protester knew the operative facts underlying this allegation prior to its initial protest , i.e., its non- selection on three prior procurements .  Thus, the information upon  Page 7 B-423412  which the protester based its new allegation in its comments w as known or should have \nbeen known prior to the filing of Sheela\u2019s initial protest.  As we explained, our \nregulations do not contemplate the piecemeal presentation or development of protest \nissues through later submissions citing examples or providing alternate or more specific \nlegal arguments missing from earlier general allegations of impropriety .  Id.  Because \nthe protester waited until its comments to raise this new argument --which could have \nbeen raised in its initial protest --it is untimely and will not be considered.3  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(2); Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec. 18, 2019, 2020 CPD \u00b6 8 \nat 11 n.13.  \n \nSecond, the protester alleges, also for the first time in its comments, that the agency\u2019s \n\u201cdecision to amend the evaluation process after the submission of proposals without \naffording offerors the opportunity to review their submissions\u201d deprived the firm of \u201cthe \nchance to adjust its submiss ion to meet any new or clarified administrative \nrequirements.\u201d  Comments at 4- 5.  We find this allegation also to be untimely.   \n Here, the solicitation was amended three times prior to the November 12 deadline for submission of proposals.  COS at  3; AR, Tab 8, RFP amend. 3 at 1.  On December 31, \nthe agency issued amendment 4, notifying all offerors that submitted proposals by the November  12 due date.  AR, Tab 18, Amendment 4 at 1; COS at 3.  Amendment 4 did \nnot extend the due date for the submission of proposals or otherwise allow for submission of proposal revisions.   \n \nOur regulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation \nwhich are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals \nshall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.   4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(1).  Where alleged improprieties do not exist in the initial solicitation, but \nsubsequently occur ( e.g., via an amendment to the solicitation), they generally must be \nprotested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals. Id .; ODL Servs. , \nB-421537 et al. , May 25, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 130 at 6.  I f no further submissions are \nanticipated, any alleged solicitation improprieties must be protested within 10 days of \nwhen the alleged impropriety was known or should have been known.   4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(1).  Because the time set for receipt of proposals had passed, Sheela was \nrequired to file any protest challenging the amended terms of the solicitation not later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of  the basis of \nthe protest --which would have been January 10, 2025.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1); ODL  \n  \n \n3 Because we find the argument to be untimely, we need not address whether Sheela\u2019s \nbare assertion states a factually and legally sufficient basis of protest, as required by our regulations .  See  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.1(c)(4) and (f) .    Page 8 B-423412  Servs. , B-421537 et al., supra.

        "Summary":"1.  Protest challenging agency\u2019s evaluation of protester\u2019s oral presentation is denied where the task order evaluation was reasonable, consistent with the solicitation,  and \nsufficiently documented.  \n 2.  Protester\u2019s challenges to other aspects of the evaluation are dismissed where the protester would not be competitively prejudiced by any misevaluation of its own proposal and was not an interested party to challenge the evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposal because another offeror was next in line for award.  \nDECISION  \n SOS International, LLC (SOSI), of Reston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) \nNo. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information \ntechnology  support services for the Army\u2019s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester \ncontends that  the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals and source selection decision were \nunreasonable.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2    B-423366.2   BACKGROUND  \n \nThe Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army\u2019s GCC.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 5 ; Agency  Report (AR), \nTab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.\n1  The \nsolicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army\u2019s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services multiple -award, indefinite-\ndelivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation anticipated \nissuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort  task order with a 1- month phase- in \nperiod, an  11-month base period of performance, three 1- year option periods, and one \nadditional  6-month option.  Id.  at 2. \n The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; \n(4) betterment; and (5) cost\/price.  Id.  at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost\/price \nfactors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost\/price factors, taken \ntogether, were significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation \nof the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign \nconfidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the agency\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror \u201c understands the requirement, proposes a \nsound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .\u201d  Id.  at 20.  The \nsolicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence \nfor any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. \n \nThe solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 1-2.  Under phase I, \nofferors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  The solicitation  advised that only those \nofferors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.     \n Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and cost\/price proposals and provide oral presentations.  Id.  at 11-18.  For oral presentations, offerors were required \nto \u201cprovide an oral presentation based on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 16.  The solicitation \nstated that oral presentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government.\u201d  Id.   \nThe solicitation also noted that oral presentations were intended to be \u201can inter active \nexchange between the Offeror and the Government\u201d and that these exchanges would \n \n1 The solicitation was amended four times.

Page 3    B-423366.2   be \u201cviewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute \ndiscussions.\u201d  Id. at 17.  The agency would \u201cnot ask questions that will invite or allow the \nOfferor to change its Proposal\u201d and warned offerors to \u201cnot volunteer any information that might be construed as changing [their] proposal.\u201d  Id.  Oral presentations would be \nevaluated by assessing the government\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements \u201cbased on the answers provided to the quest ions \nprovided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 20 .  As relevant here, the solicitation informed offerors that if an  \nofferor did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral presentation, the offeror would not be considered for the award.   Id. at 18.   \n Seven offerors, including SOSI  and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS\/MOL \nat 18.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the agency \nconducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for  offerors to update their phase I \nsubmissions.  Id. at 20; AR, Tab  45, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating \nthe updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including SOSI  and \nPeraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II proposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  21; AR, Tab  55, Task \nOrder Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   \n During each offeror\u2019s oral presentation, the agency provided nine scenario- based \nquestions, two hours to  prepare the presentation in response to the questions, and one \nhour to present the responses.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD  at 9-10.  Each offeror was \nasked one follow -up question \u201cto clarify the technical team\u2019s understanding of the \nOfferor\u2019s answer to one of the questions.\u201d  COS\/MOL at  29; see generally, AR, Tab  60d, \nContracting Officer \u2019s Oral Presentation Notes.  The agency decided not to record the \noral pres entations , but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) \ntook contemporaneous notes.   COS\/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, \nEvaluators \u2019 Oral Presentation Notes.  Each PEB member individually evaluated  each \noral presentation, identified findings, and assigned ratings for each answer to each of \nthe nine questions.  COS\/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, Evaluators\u2019 Oral \nPresentation Notes; AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1, 9-11.  \nFollowing the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors\u2019 oral presentations .  COS\/MOL at  21; see \ngenerally , AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report.  \n Following  the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of SOSI  and \nPeraton were assigned the following final ratings:  \n \n SOSI  Peraton  \nDemonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nKey Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nOral Presentation  Some  Confidence  High Confidence  \nBetterment  1 1 \nTotal Evaluated Cost  $219,448,970  $225,089,343   Page 4    B-423366.2    \nAR, Tab  55, TODD at  15, 33.   \n As relevant here, in assigning a rating of some confidence to SOSI\u2019s oral presentation, the agency found that while the \u201c[p]resentation was professional  and succinct ,\u201d it \n\u201c[r]eceived some confidence based on [the] knowledge, skills, and abilities \ndemonstrated in responses to some [of the] technical and staffing approach questions \nand scenario- based questions.\u201d  AR, Tab 54, Oral Presentation Consensus Evaluation \nat 7.  In this regard, a compilation of the evaluators\u2019 assessments showed that all three \nevaluators assigned a rating of low or  some confidence for SOSI\u2019s responses to five of \nthe nine oral presentation questions.  Id. at 9-11. \n The contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the technical evaluation reports and concurred with their findings.  AR, Tab  55, TODD \nat 1, 12.  Noting the provision in the solicitation that only proposals with the rating of \nhigh confidence under the oral presentation factor  would be considered for award, the \nSSA did not consider  SOSI\u2019s proposal for award because of its oral presentation rating \nof some confidence.  Id.  at 34.  The SSA conducted a comparative tradeoff analysis \nbetween Peraton and another offeror , whose proposal received a rating of high \nconfidence under the first three evaluation factors , and selected Peraton\u2019s  proposal for \naward.  Id.  at 35-40.   \n The Army provided a debriefing to SOSI , and this protest followed.\n2   \n DISCUSSION \n \nThe protester argues that the agency\u2019s evaluation of SOSI\u2019s  oral presentation was \nunreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation, and undocumented.  Protest at  18-27.  \nThe protester also contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s betterment proposal, improperly failed to meaningfully  investigate and identify  the \nawardee\u2019s organizational conflict of interest  (OCI), and unreasonably excluded SOSI\u2019s  \nproposal from the best -value tradeoff.\n3  Id. at 27-38.  For the reasons discussed below, \n \n2 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this \nprotest is within our Office\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the \nauthority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n3 In its protest, SOSI also alleged that the agency unreasonably evaluated the \nawardee\u2019s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor.  Protest at  34-35.  After \nreviewing the agency\u2019s response to this allegation, see COS\/MOL at 53-59, the \nprotester stated that it is \u201cnot further pursuing its challenge to Peraton\u2019s Key Personnel evaluation at this time.\u201d  Comments at  35 n.8.  We therefore deem  this issue withdrawn.   Page 5    B-423366.2   we conclude that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s oral presentation and \nreasonably excluded SOSI\u2019s proposal from further consideration.4     \n Oral Presentations  \n \nThe protester challenges the Army\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation, \narguing that the agency\u2019s conduct of the presentations departed from the solicitation \nand that the agency unreasonably criticized the protester\u2019s technically sound solutions.\n5  \nProtest at  18-27; Comments at  16, 18- 25.  The protester also contends that the Army\u2019s \ndocumentation of the oral presentation was inadequate because the agency  failed to \ndocument the actual oral presentations as presented, only retaining individual \nevaluators\u2019 illegible and inconsistent notes.  Protest at  19-20; Comments at  17-18.  \nThe agency responds that it evaluated SOSI\u2019s oral presentation reasonabl y and in \naccordance with the solicitation,  and that the evaluation was sufficiently documented.  \nCOS\/MOL at 24-38.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to \neither the evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation or to the documentation of that \nevaluation.    As an initial matter, in challenging the agency\u2019s documentation of the oral presentations, \nthe protester relies in large part on our decisions in Connected Global Sols., LLC , \nB-418266.4, B -418266.7, Oct. 21, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 349, and HomeSafe Alliance, \nLLC, B-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  350.  See Protest at  19, 22; \nComments at  17.  We find, however, that the protester\u2019s reliance is misplaced because \nthose decisions involved negotiated procurements under FAR part  15, while the \nprocurement at i ssue here is a task order competition conducted under the procedures \nof FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task order competition \nunder FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less \nrigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B -421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, \n2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., B-419210, B -419210.2, \nDec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 409 at  4-5.   \n \nIn this regard, unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted \nunder FAR part  15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral \npresentations in task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare FAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) \nprovides that contracting officers may \u201cexercise broad discretion in developing \n \n4 Although we do not discuss every argument raised by the protester, we have \nconsidered them all and find no basis to sustain the protest . \n5 The protester also asserts  that the agency departed from the solicitation by \nmechanically asking one follow -up question to each offeror when the solicitation stated \nthat oral presentations would be an interactive exchange.  Comments at  16-17.  \nBecause the solicitation here did not require the agency to ask any specific number of questions or to inquire about all shortcomings observed in an offeror\u2019s oral presentation, we find that the protester has not shown that the decision to ask one follow -up question \nof each offeror was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.

TOPR at  16; \nsee COS\/MOL at  28.  The agency instead maintained its documentation of the oral \npresentations by retaining the contemporaneous handwritten notes of  the three \ntechnical evaluators and the contracting officer , and then convening  a panel to prepare \na consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  28; see generally,  AR, \nTab 54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report ; AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, 60d, \nEvaluators \u2019 Oral Presentation Notes.\n6   \n Based on our review of this record, we find that  the agency\u2019s evaluative assessment of \nthe offerors\u2019 oral presentations  was sufficiently documented.  While the evaluators\u2019 \nnotes do not document every aspect of the offerors\u2019 oral presentations, they do provide the agency\u2019s documentation of the particular aspects of the offerors\u2019 presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluative judgments .\n7  Where the solicitation \nspecifically advised offerors that the agency may not record the oral presentations, we see no applicable law or regulation that required the agency to have gone further and \nrecord or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR subpart  16.5.  See Accenture Fed.

See AR, Tabs  60a(1), 60b(1), 60c(1), \nTranscribed Oral Presentation Notes.  \n7 We also reject the protester\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s  documentation is inadequate \nbecause the content of the evaluators\u2019 notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments at  18, 24.  It is \nwell-settled that, following discussions among evaluators, an agency may reach \nconsensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator\u2019s asse ssment.

Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  \n Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof the protester\u2019s oral presentation.   While  the protester challenges the agency\u2019s \nassessment of the protester\u2019s responses to five of the nine oral presentation questions , \nthe record shows that the evaluators reasonably assigned low or some confidence ratings  for failing to address certain required aspects of the questions asked.  W e \ndiscuss below two of the responses  as representative examples.  \n For question number  2, the agency asked offerors to address how they would provide \nArmy.mil \/ Army365 tenant management and support within the enterprise services division under PWS section 3.3.  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The \nagency summarized its evaluation of the protester\u2019s response as follows:  \n \nThe offeror focused on management\/procedural implementations for the technical  scenario, but did not provide any technological solutions.  The \nofferor provided examples  for use of data displayed in a visual, digestible \nformat, however, the examples were for  internal administration and not \nfocused on improving the user experience.   The example given for a \nPower Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.   \n AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI\u2019s presentation for \nquestion 2 received one rating of some confidence and two ratings of low confidence \nfrom the individual evaluators.   Id. at 9. \n  Page 8    B-423366.2   The protester  asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable because the \nquestion \u201cdid not request a technical solution\u201d but instead was \u201cfocused on our process \nfor providing a project plan.\u201d  Protest at  23; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. \nat 4.  The protester also argues that the question \u201cdid not indicate that the Army wanted \nto understand the \u2018user experience\u2019 of external customers  as opposed to those involved \nin internal administration.\u201d  Protest at  23.  In this regard, the protester recalls question 2 \nto be about \u201chow [SOSI] would implement a large- scale project plan for  Directory \nServices\u201d and asserts that its response properly \u201cfocused on using continuous service \nimprovement [] --enabled by continual collaboration with\u201d its GCC mission partner.8  Id.; \nProtest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  3.   \n \nThe agency responds  that the protester\u2019s recollection of question 2 was incomplete and  \ntherefore the firm\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of its response was likewise  flawed.  \nCOS\/MOL at 31-32.  The record shows that question 2 asked as follows : \n \nProvide Army.mil \/ Army365 Tenant Management and Support detailed within the PWS under Enterprise Services Division Support paragraph 3.3 \nand related sub- paragraphs.  What are the specific steps you would take \nto manage current Army Unified Directory Service functions to support a \nglobal user base commitment?  How would you organize, prioritize, and \nmanage the diverse, parallel, and time- minded DevOps activities \nassociated with supporting the global userbase?  What are the specific \nsteps you currently take to gather, develop, and maintain metrics and dashboards for virtualization data?  Describe how you have employed \ntools such as Microsoft\u2019s  Power [Business Intelligence] , Microsoft Power \nApps, and Elastic to improve the end user\u2019s experience.  \n AR, Tab  62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The agency argues that, given the \nactual question asked, the evaluators reasonably assessed the protester\u2019s response with low to some confidence for failing to provide a technical solution that addressed end-user experience.  COS\/MOL at  32. \n On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation on question 2.  First, contrary to the protester\u2019s recollection, the record \nshows that question 2 clearly sought a technical solution.  Specifically, the question \nasked the offeror to address  Army365 tenant management and support services under \nPWS section 3.3, which requires the contractor to \u201c[a]ssess service -based alerts, \ndevelop\/determine Enterprise mission impact, report significant outages, and develop technical\/non- technical alerts to the filed.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  14-15.  In addition, the \nquestion pointedly required the offeror  to address how it would \u201csupport the global user \n \n8 Because the agency\u2019s debriefing to SOSI did not provide a copy of the oral \npresentation questions, SOSI\u2019s protest allegations were based on \u201cthe best of SOSI\u2019s recollection\u201d of the questions and SOSI\u2019s responses , as recalled by  SOSI\u2019s corporate \nrepresentative who attended the oral presentation.  See Protest at 21; Protest exh.  12, \nSOSI Representative Decl. at  1.

In fact, by asserting that the agency\u2019s  question did not ask for a \ntechnical solution or to address end- user experience, the protester  belies any assertion \nthat its response to this question did address these aspects.   See Protest, exh.  12, \nSOSI Representative Decl. at  3-4.   \n \nMoreover, the evaluators\u2019 contemporaneous notes consistently documented that SOSI\u2019s \nresponse to this question did not provide the required technical solutions and failed to \nfocus on improving user experience.  See AR, Tab  60a(1), Transcribed Oral \nPresentation Notes  of Evaluator  A at 1 (\u201cOfferor provided management solutions but no \ntechnical options.  Discussions of tools were not focused on improving user experience.\u201d); AR, Tab 60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes  of Evaluator C at  1 \n(\u201cprovided [management] solution to a tech problem. Did not give clear example at improving end user experience, only for [contractor] community.\u201d) .  On this record , we \nfind unobjectionable the agency\u2019s consensus conclusion that the protester\u2019s \npresentation for question 2 \u201cdid not provide any technological solutions \u201d and was  \u201cnot \nfocused on improving the user experience. \u201d  AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Consensus \nEvaluation at  7, 9. \n The protester also argues that the agency \u2019s evaluation unreasonably failed to consider \nadditional information that SOSI provided, bearing on question 2,  in response to the \nagency\u2019s follow -up question.  Protest at  23; Comments at  20-21.  In this regard, the \nprotester recall s that the follow- up question asked SOSI to \u201cprovide other examples for \nhow [it] would apply a project plan for Directory Services\u201d  and asserts that SOSI \nresponded to the question with the required information.   Id.; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI  \nRepresentative Decl. at  3-4.  The record, however,  show s that the actual follow -up \nquestion asked SOSI to \u201cexpand upon how [ it] ha[s] employed tools such as Microsoft \u2019s \nPower [Business Intelligence], Microsoft Power apps, and Elastic to improve the end user\u2019s experience. \u201d  AR, Tab 60d, CO Notes at  4.   \n The protester maintains that  the agency nevertheless failed to consider its response to \nthe question in the overall assessment of SOSI\u2019s oral presentation.   Comments at  21.  \nWe find no basis in the record to support the protester\u2019s position.   In this regard, after \nreviewing the record (including the documentation of the follow -up question and the \nevaluators\u2019 notes ), the protester  now asserts  that its follow -up response \u201cnecessarily \nincluded a discussion of the user experience and additional information about using Microsoft Power [Business Intelligence] and the other tools .\u201d  Id.  This assertion, \nhowever,  is contradicted by the initial recollection of SOSI\u2019s own representative who \nparticipated in the oral presentation.  S ee Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. \nat 4.  Specifically , SOSI\u2019s representative recall ed that SOSI\u2019s response to the follow- up \nquestion addressed how it uses  \u201can internally developed SOS [I] application that \nprovides customers and stakeholders with project status dashboards (using Microsoft \nPower [Business Intelligence]) for large- scale projects .\u201d  Id.  He further recall ed that \nSOSI explained that this application \u201cgives customers and stakeholders transparency into the status of all program aspects, including the status of deliverables, metrics on cybersecurity status and posture, and other program metrics.\u201d  Id.   Notably, this  Page 10    B-423366.2   recollection did not mention whether SOSI\u2019s response included improving the end-user \nexperience  despite this  issue  being flagged during SOSI\u2019s debriefing.   See AR, Tab  57, \nPost-Award Debriefing Slides at  27.  In fact, as noted above, the protester initially \nargued that question 2 and the follow -up question did not ask SOSI to address end- user \nexperiences.  See  Protest at  23. \n \nConsistent with the protester\u2019s initial recollection of its responses to question 2 and the \nfollow- up question, t he evaluators found that SOSI \u201cprovided examples for use of data \ndisplayed in a visual, digestible format, however, the examples were for internal administration and not focused on improving the user experience.\u201d  AR, Tab  54, Oral \nPresentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  The agency  also found that the example \nSOSI gave for a \u201cPower Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.\u201d  Id.  As noted, these findings were also \nsupported by the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the evaluators.  See AR, \nTab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab 60c(1), \nTranscribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator C at  1.  The agency\u2019s consensus \nevaluation of SOSI\u2019s response to question 2, therefore, is consistent not only with the \nindividual evaluators\u2019 contemporaneous record of SOSI\u2019s oral presentation, but also with the protester\u2019s recollection of the response SOSI  provided to the follow -up \nquestion.  To the extent the protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s assessment of the \nmerits of the protester\u2019s oral presentation, such disagreement, without more, is not \nsufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network \nServs., Inc., supra .  \n As another example, question number 3 asked offerors to \u201cdescribe how [they] would \nconstruct a zero trust administrative model\u201d for a specified scenario requiring \nadministrative access to end- user devices , and to \u201c[i]ncorporate any commercially \navailable Microsoft Azure and\/or Entra ID feature configurations to describe [the] proposed design.\u201d  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The protester object s \nto the agency\u2019s evaluation of SOSI\u2019s response to question 3, in which the agency found \nas follows : \n \nThis scenario- based question was specific to a public cloud infrastructure, \nbut the offeror answered the question from the perspective of a traditional Active Directory environment.  The offeror identified some key principles necessary for Azure Entra- ID m anagement, but the response was not \nholistically focused on a public cloud as the scenario required.  The offeror \ndid not discuss using attribute- based access controls (which was \nmentioned in the description of Entra- ID) to include objects into \nAdministrat ive Units where access would be delegated or denied as \nappropriate.  \n \nAR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI\u2019s presentation for \nquestion 3 received two  ratings of some confidence and one rating of low confidence \nfrom the individual evaluators .  Id. at 9. \n  Page 11    B-423366.2   SOSI argues  that the agency\u2019s criticism  mischaracterizes SOSI\u2019s presentation and \n\u201cdoes not track\u201d the question asked.  Protest  at 24; Comments at  21-22.  We  find that \nthe protester\u2019s assertions  are not supported by the record.  \n \nIn its initial protest filing, the protester  relies on its representative\u2019s  recollection  to assert \nthat SOSI\u2019s response to question 3 \u201caddressed . . . cloud- specific security on a public \ncloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for cloud- native security controls --essential \nfor implementing Zero Trust in such environments.\u201d   Protest at  24, citing Protest, \nexh. 12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  5.  The  contemporaneous notes  of the agency\u2019s \nevaluators , however, consistently  documented that SOSI\u2019s response to question 3 \n\u201c[d]iscussed implementation in a traditional [active directory] forest, not cloud\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t fully cover cloud env[ironment].\u201d  AR, Tab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation \nNotes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab  60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of \nEvaluator C at  2.  Moreover, while  the protester initially  assert ed that the question \u201cdid \nnot ask specifically about Azure Entra- ID management ,\u201d Protest at 24, the record shows \nthat the question specifically ask ed that the offeror\u2019s proposed solution \u201c[i] ncorporate \nany commercially  available Microsoft Azure and\/or Entra ID feature configurations .\u201d  AR, \nTab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.   \n After reviewing the agency report (which  included the evaluator s\u2019 notes  and the oral \npresentation questions provided to offerors ), the protester argues  that question 3 \u201cdoes \nnot ask offerors to address this issue from a cloud perspective\u201d because \u201cthe word \n\u2018cloud\u2019 does not even appear in the question.\u201d  Comments at  22.  This new argument, \nhowever, contradicts  both its prior  declaration recalling that  question 3 was \u201ca \nscenario- based question which related to zero- trust implementation of directory services \non a public cloud infrastructure\u201d  and its  initial assertion that its presentation \u201caddressed \n. . . cloud- specific security on a public cloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for \ncloud- native security controls .\u201d  Protest at  24; Protest, exh. 12, SOSI Representative \nDecl. at  5 (emphasis added) .  Further, question 3 specifically  asked offerors to \nincorporate \u201cMicrosoft Azure and\/or Entra ID,\u201d which are a cloud computing platform and a cloud- based access management  service , respectively.  See  \nhttps:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en -us\/resources\/cloud- computing- dictionary\/what -is-azure \n(last visited June 2, 2025); https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en -us\/entra\/fundamentals\/whatis  \n(last visited June 2, 2025) .  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably  assigned \nlow to some confidence ratings  for the protester\u2019s response to question 3 for, among \nother things, failing to propose a cloud- based solution as required.  \n In sum, based on our review of the record, including the contemporaneous evaluator notes, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation of SOSI\u2019s oral presentation.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.   \n Remaining Challenges  \n SOSI also  challenges  the agency\u2019s evaluation of the firm\u2019s proposal under the \nbetterment factor  and argues that the agency unreasonably excluded the proposal from \nthe best -value tradeoff analysis.  Protest at  27-30, 35- 38.  The protester also argues  Page 12    B-423366.2   that the agency unreasonably failed to meaningfully investigate and identify  the \nawardee\u2019s OCI.  Id. at 30-33.  As noted above, the solicitation stated that a proposal \nrated low or some confidence for the oral presentation factor would not be considered \nfor award.  TOPR at  18.  Because we find that the agency reasonably  excluded the \nprotester\u2019s proposal  from further consideration based on the rating of some confidence \nassigned to SOSI\u2019s oral presentation,  we find that  the protester  was not competitively \nprejudiced by any errors with respect to other aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nSOSI \u2019s proposal .  In this regard, even if the protester could show that other aspects of \nthe evaluation of its proposal were unreasonable, its proposal was properly eliminated from further consideration for award.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where n one is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a \nprotest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency\u2019s actions arguably \nwere improper.  Zolon PCS, LLC , B-419283, Jan.  14, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  26 at  8; \nVSolvit, LLC, supra.  at 6.   \n SOSI is also not an interested party to challenge the agency\u2019s evaluation of Peraton\u2019s proposal.  In order for a protest to be considered by our Office, a protester must be an interested party, meaning it must have a direct economic interest in the resolut ion of a \nprotest issue.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.0(a).  A protester is an interested party to challenge the \nevaluation of an awardee\u2019s proposal only where there is a reasonable possibility that the protester\u2019s proposal would be in line for award if the protest were to be sustained.  \nVerisys Corp. , B-413204.5 et al., Oct. 2, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  338 at  13.  Where there is \nan acceptable offeror that would be in line for the award ahead of the protester if the protester\u2019s challenge to the award were to be sustained, the protester\u2019s interest is too remote to qualify as an interested party.  SRA Int'l, Inc.; NTT DATA Servs. Fed. Gov't, \nInc., B-413220.4 et al., May 19, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  173 at  28.  Here, there was another \ntechnically acceptable offeror whose proposal received the rating of high confidence under each of the first three non- cost\/price evaluation factors.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD \nat 35.  This offer or\u2019s proposal would be next in line for award if SOSI\u2019s allegations were \nsustained.  Accordingly, based on our conclusion that the agency reasonably found SOSI\u2019s proposal ineligible for award, we conclude that SOSI is not an interested party to challenge the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposal because it would not be in line for contract award were its protest to be sustained.    \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

Protest challenging agency\u2019s evaluation of protester\u2019s oral presentation is denied where the task order evaluation was reasonable, consistent with the solicitation,  and \nsufficiently documented.  \n 2.  Protester\u2019s challenges to other aspects of the evaluation are dismissed where the protester would not be competitively prejudiced by any misevaluation of its own proposal and was not an interested party to challenge the evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposal because another offeror was next in line for award.  \nDECISION  \n SOS International, LLC (SOSI), of Reston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) \nNo. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information \ntechnology  support services for the Army\u2019s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester \ncontends that  the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals and source selection decision were \nunreasonable.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2    B-423366.2   BACKGROUND  \n \nThe Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army\u2019s GCC.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 5 ; Agency  Report (AR), \nTab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.\n1  The \nsolicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army\u2019s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services multiple -award, indefinite-\ndelivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation anticipated \nissuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort  task order with a 1- month phase- in \nperiod, an  11-month base period of performance, three 1- year option periods, and one \nadditional  6-month option.  Id.  at 2. \n The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; \n(4) betterment; and (5) cost\/price.  Id.  at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost\/price \nfactors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost\/price factors, taken \ntogether, were significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation \nof the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign \nconfidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the agency\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror \u201c understands the requirement, proposes a \nsound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .\u201d  Id.  at 20.  The \nsolicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence \nfor any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. \n \nThe solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 1-2.  Under phase I, \nofferors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  The solicitation  advised that only those \nofferors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.     \n Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and cost\/price proposals and provide oral presentations.  Id.  at 11-18.  For oral presentations, offerors were required \nto \u201cprovide an oral presentation based on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 16.  The solicitation \nstated that oral presentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government.\u201d  Id.   \nThe solicitation also noted that oral presentations were intended to be \u201can inter active \nexchange between the Offeror and the Government\u201d and that these exchanges would \n \n1 The solicitation was amended four times.  Unless otherwise noted, citations to the \nsolicitation are to the final amended version of the TOPR provided in tab 25 of the \nagency report.

Page 3    B-423366.2   be \u201cviewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute \ndiscussions.\u201d  Id. at 17.  The agency would \u201cnot ask questions that will invite or allow the \nOfferor to change its Proposal\u201d and warned offerors to \u201cnot volunteer any information that might be construed as changing [their] proposal.\u201d  Id.  Oral presentations would be \nevaluated by assessing the government\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements \u201cbased on the answers provided to the quest ions \nprovided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 20 .  As relevant here, the solicitation informed offerors that if an  \nofferor did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral presentation, the offeror would not be considered for the award.   Id. at 18.   \n Seven offerors, including SOSI  and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS\/MOL \nat 18.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the agency \nconducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for  offerors to update their phase I \nsubmissions.  Id. at 20; AR, Tab  45, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating \nthe updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including SOSI  and \nPeraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II proposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  21; AR, Tab  55, Task \nOrder Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   \n During each offeror\u2019s oral presentation, the agency provided nine scenario- based \nquestions, two hours to  prepare the presentation in response to the questions, and one \nhour to present the responses.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD  at 9-10.  Each offeror was \nasked one follow -up question \u201cto clarify the technical team\u2019s understanding of the \nOfferor\u2019s answer to one of the questions.\u201d  COS\/MOL at  29; see generally, AR, Tab  60d, \nContracting Officer \u2019s Oral Presentation Notes.  The agency decided not to record the \noral pres entations , but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) \ntook contemporaneous notes.   COS\/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, \nEvaluators \u2019 Oral Presentation Notes.  Each PEB member individually evaluated  each \noral presentation, identified findings, and assigned ratings for each answer to each of \nthe nine questions.  COS\/MOL at  21; see AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, Evaluators\u2019 Oral \nPresentation Notes; AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1, 9-11.  \nFollowing the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors\u2019 oral presentations .  COS\/MOL at  21; see \ngenerally , AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report.  \n Following  the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of SOSI  and \nPeraton were assigned the following final ratings:  \n \n SOSI  Peraton  \nDemonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nKey Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nOral Presentation  Some  Confidence  High Confidence  \nBetterment  1 1 \nTotal Evaluated Cost  $219,448,970  $225,089,343   Page 4    B-423366.2    \nAR, Tab  55, TODD at  15, 33.   \n As relevant here, in assigning a rating of some confidence to SOSI\u2019s oral presentation, the agency found that while the \u201c[p]resentation was professional  and succinct ,\u201d it \n\u201c[r]eceived some confidence based on [the] knowledge, skills, and abilities \ndemonstrated in responses to some [of the] technical and staffing approach questions \nand scenario- based questions.\u201d  AR, Tab 54, Oral Presentation Consensus Evaluation \nat 7.  In this regard, a compilation of the evaluators\u2019 assessments showed that all three \nevaluators assigned a rating of low or  some confidence for SOSI\u2019s responses to five of \nthe nine oral presentation questions.  Id. at 9-11. \n The contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the technical evaluation reports and concurred with their findings.  AR, Tab  55, TODD \nat 1, 12.  Noting the provision in the solicitation that only proposals with the rating of \nhigh confidence under the oral presentation factor  would be considered for award, the \nSSA did not consider  SOSI\u2019s proposal for award because of its oral presentation rating \nof some confidence.  Id.  at 34.  The SSA conducted a comparative tradeoff analysis \nbetween Peraton and another offeror , whose proposal received a rating of high \nconfidence under the first three evaluation factors , and selected Peraton\u2019s  proposal for \naward.  Id.  at 35-40.   \n The Army provided a debriefing to SOSI , and this protest followed.\n2   \n DISCUSSION \n \nThe protester argues that the agency\u2019s evaluation of SOSI\u2019s  oral presentation was \nunreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation, and undocumented.  Protest at  18-27.  \nThe protester also contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s betterment proposal, improperly failed to meaningfully  investigate and identify  the \nawardee\u2019s organizational conflict of interest  (OCI), and unreasonably excluded SOSI\u2019s  \nproposal from the best -value tradeoff.\n3  Id. at 27-38.  For the reasons discussed below, \n \n2 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this \nprotest is within our Office\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the \nauthority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n3 In its protest, SOSI also alleged that the agency unreasonably evaluated the \nawardee\u2019s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor.  Protest at  34-35.  After \nreviewing the agency\u2019s response to this allegation, see COS\/MOL at 53-59, the \nprotester stated that it is \u201cnot further pursuing its challenge to Peraton\u2019s Key Personnel evaluation at this time.\u201d  Comments at  35 n.8.  We therefore deem  this issue withdrawn.   Page 5    B-423366.2   we conclude that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s oral presentation and \nreasonably excluded SOSI\u2019s proposal from further consideration.4     \n Oral Presentations  \n \nThe protester challenges the Army\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation, \narguing that the agency\u2019s conduct of the presentations departed from the solicitation \nand that the agency unreasonably criticized the protester\u2019s technically sound solutions.\n5  \nProtest at  18-27; Comments at  16, 18- 25.  The protester also contends that the Army\u2019s \ndocumentation of the oral presentation was inadequate because the agency  failed to \ndocument the actual oral presentations as presented, only retaining individual \nevaluators\u2019 illegible and inconsistent notes.  Protest at  19-20; Comments at  17-18.  \nThe agency responds that it evaluated SOSI\u2019s oral presentation reasonabl y and in \naccordance with the solicitation,  and that the evaluation was sufficiently documented.  \nCOS\/MOL at 24-38.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to object to \neither the evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation or to the documentation of that \nevaluation.    As an initial matter, in challenging the agency\u2019s documentation of the oral presentations, \nthe protester relies in large part on our decisions in Connected Global Sols., LLC , \nB-418266.4, B -418266.7, Oct. 21, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 349, and HomeSafe Alliance, \nLLC, B-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  350.  See Protest at  19, 22; \nComments at  17.  We find, however, that the protester\u2019s reliance is misplaced because \nthose decisions involved negotiated procurements under FAR part  15, while the \nprocurement at i ssue here is a task order competition conducted under the procedures \nof FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task order competition \nunder FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less \nrigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B -421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, \n2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., B-419210, B -419210.2, \nDec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 409 at  4-5.   \n \nIn this regard, unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted \nunder FAR part  15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral \npresentations in task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare FAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) \nprovides that contracting officers may \u201cexercise broad discretion in developing \n \n4 Although we do not discuss every argument raised by the protester, we have \nconsidered them all and find no basis to sustain the protest . \n5 The protester also asserts  that the agency departed from the solicitation by \nmechanically asking one follow -up question to each offeror when the solicitation stated \nthat oral presentations would be an interactive exchange.  Comments at  16-17.  \nBecause the solicitation here did not require the agency to ask any specific number of questions or to inquire about all shortcomings observed in an offeror\u2019s oral presentation, we find that the protester has not shown that the decision to ask one follow -up question \nof each offeror was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.    Page 6    B-423366.2   appropriate order placement procedures,\u201d \u201ckeep submission requirements to a \nminimum,\u201d and \u201cuse streamlined procedures including oral presentations.\u201d  With respect to required documentation, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  requires contracting officers only \nto \u201cdocument in the contract file the rationale for placement and price of each order, \nincluding the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs among cost or price and \nnon-cost considerations in making the award decision.\u201d   \n Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government,\u201d and, in fact,  the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16; \nsee COS\/MOL at  28.  The agency instead maintained its documentation of the oral \npresentations by retaining the contemporaneous handwritten notes of  the three \ntechnical evaluators and the contracting officer , and then convening  a panel to prepare \na consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  28; see generally,  AR, \nTab 54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report ; AR, Tabs  60a, 60b, 60c, 60d, \nEvaluators \u2019 Oral Presentation Notes.\n6   \n Based on our review of this record, we find that  the agency\u2019s evaluative assessment of \nthe offerors\u2019 oral presentations  was sufficiently documented.  While the evaluators\u2019 \nnotes do not document every aspect of the offerors\u2019 oral presentations, they do provide the agency\u2019s documentation of the particular aspects of the offerors\u2019 presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluative judgments .\n7  Where the solicitation \nspecifically advised offerors that the agency may not record the oral presentations, we see no applicable law or regulation that required the agency to have gone further and \nrecord or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR subpart  16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., \nLLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, Nov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 365 at 7 (\u201cWe see \nno requirement in law or regulation that an agency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart  8.4, and it is not our role \nto impose one where the FAR does not.\u201d) . \n The protester next challenges the evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation itself.  \nIn this regard, t he protester asserts  that the agency unreasonably evaluated the \n \n6 In response of the protester\u2019s complaint that  parts of the individual evaluators\u2019 notes \nwere \u201cvirtually illegible,\u201d  Comments at  18, our Office requested that the agency provide \ntyped transcriptions of the evaluators\u2019 handwritten notes, and the agency supplemented the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  60a(1), 60b(1), 60c(1), \nTranscribed Oral Presentation Notes.  \n7 We also reject the protester\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s  documentation is inadequate \nbecause the content of the evaluators\u2019 notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments at  18, 24.  It is \nwell-settled that, following discussions among evaluators, an agency may reach \nconsensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator\u2019s asse ssment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; see e.g. , Unitec Distribution \nSys., B-419874, B -419874.2, Aug. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  307 at  4.

Protest at  20-27; Comments at  18-25.  The protester also contends that \nthe agency unreasonably  failed to consider the protester\u2019s response to the agency\u2019s  \nfollow- up question.  Comments at  16-17. \n \nThe evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency\u2019s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc., \nB-419271.5 et al., Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  191 at  7.  In reviewing a protest \nchallenging an agency\u2019s technical evaluation, our Office does not independently evaluate proposals; rather, we review the agency\u2019s evaluation to ensure that it is consistent wi th the terms of the solicitation and applicable statutes and regulations.   \nVSolvit, LLC, B -418265.2, B -418265.3, July  30, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  259 at  5.  We have \nconsistently stated that we will question the agency \u2019s evaluation only where the record \nshows that the evaluation does not have a reasonable basis or is inconsistent with the \nsolicitation .  Id.; Data Matrix Sols., Inc., B -412520, Mar.  14, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  87 at  5.  \nA protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment regarding the evaluation of propos als, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted \nunreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  \n Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof the protester\u2019s oral presentation.   While  the protester challenges the agency\u2019s \nassessment of the protester\u2019s responses to five of the nine oral presentation questions , \nthe record shows that the evaluators reasonably assigned low or some confidence ratings  for failing to address certain required aspects of the questions asked.  W e \ndiscuss below two of the responses  as representative examples.  \n For question number  2, the agency asked offerors to address how they would provide \nArmy.mil \/ Army365 tenant management and support within the enterprise services division under PWS section 3.3.  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The \nagency summarized its evaluation of the protester\u2019s response as follows:  \n \nThe offeror focused on management\/procedural implementations for the technical  scenario, but did not provide any technological solutions.  The \nofferor provided examples  for use of data displayed in a visual, digestible \nformat, however, the examples were for  internal administration and not \nfocused on improving the user experience.   The example given for a \nPower Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.   \n AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI\u2019s presentation for \nquestion 2 received one rating of some confidence and two ratings of low confidence \nfrom the individual evaluators.   Id. at 9. \n  Page 8    B-423366.2   The protester  asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable because the \nquestion \u201cdid not request a technical solution\u201d but instead was \u201cfocused on our process \nfor providing a project plan.\u201d  Protest at  23; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. \nat 4.  The protester also argues that the question \u201cdid not indicate that the Army wanted \nto understand the \u2018user experience\u2019 of external customers  as opposed to those involved \nin internal administration.\u201d  Protest at  23.  In this regard, the protester recalls question 2 \nto be about \u201chow [SOSI] would implement a large- scale project plan for  Directory \nServices\u201d and asserts that its response properly \u201cfocused on using continuous service \nimprovement [] --enabled by continual collaboration with\u201d its GCC mission partner.8  Id.; \nProtest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  3.   \n \nThe agency responds  that the protester\u2019s recollection of question 2 was incomplete and  \ntherefore the firm\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of its response was likewise  flawed.  \nCOS\/MOL at 31-32.  The record shows that question 2 asked as follows : \n \nProvide Army.mil \/ Army365 Tenant Management and Support detailed within the PWS under Enterprise Services Division Support paragraph 3.3 \nand related sub- paragraphs.  What are the specific steps you would take \nto manage current Army Unified Directory Service functions to support a \nglobal user base commitment?  How would you organize, prioritize, and \nmanage the diverse, parallel, and time- minded DevOps activities \nassociated with supporting the global userbase?  What are the specific \nsteps you currently take to gather, develop, and maintain metrics and dashboards for virtualization data?  Describe how you have employed \ntools such as Microsoft\u2019s  Power [Business Intelligence] , Microsoft Power \nApps, and Elastic to improve the end user\u2019s experience.  \n AR, Tab  62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The agency argues that, given the \nactual question asked, the evaluators reasonably assessed the protester\u2019s response with low to some confidence for failing to provide a technical solution that addressed end-user experience.  COS\/MOL at  32. \n On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s oral presentation on question 2.  First, contrary to the protester\u2019s recollection, the record \nshows that question 2 clearly sought a technical solution.  Specifically, the question \nasked the offeror to address  Army365 tenant management and support services under \nPWS section 3.3, which requires the contractor to \u201c[a]ssess service -based alerts, \ndevelop\/determine Enterprise mission impact, report significant outages, and develop technical\/non- technical alerts to the filed.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  14-15.  In addition, the \nquestion pointedly required the offeror  to address how it would \u201csupport the global user \n \n8 Because the agency\u2019s debriefing to SOSI did not provide a copy of the oral \npresentation questions, SOSI\u2019s protest allegations were based on \u201cthe best of SOSI\u2019s recollection\u201d of the questions and SOSI\u2019s responses , as recalled by  SOSI\u2019s corporate \nrepresentative who attended the oral presentation.  See Protest at 21; Protest exh.  12, \nSOSI Representative Decl. at  1.

In fact, by asserting that the agency\u2019s  question did not ask for a \ntechnical solution or to address end- user experience, the protester  belies any assertion \nthat its response to this question did address these aspects.   See Protest, exh.  12, \nSOSI Representative Decl. at  3-4.   \n \nMoreover, the evaluators\u2019 contemporaneous notes consistently documented that SOSI\u2019s \nresponse to this question did not provide the required technical solutions and failed to \nfocus on improving user experience.  See AR, Tab  60a(1), Transcribed Oral \nPresentation Notes  of Evaluator  A at 1 (\u201cOfferor provided management solutions but no \ntechnical options.  Discussions of tools were not focused on improving user experience.\u201d); AR, Tab 60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes  of Evaluator C at  1 \n(\u201cprovided [management] solution to a tech problem. Did not give clear example at improving end user experience, only for [contractor] community.\u201d) .  On this record , we \nfind unobjectionable the agency\u2019s consensus conclusion that the protester\u2019s \npresentation for question 2 \u201cdid not provide any technological solutions \u201d and was  \u201cnot \nfocused on improving the user experience. \u201d  AR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Consensus \nEvaluation at  7, 9. \n The protester also argues that the agency \u2019s evaluation unreasonably failed to consider \nadditional information that SOSI provided, bearing on question 2,  in response to the \nagency\u2019s follow -up question.  Protest at  23; Comments at  20-21.  In this regard, the \nprotester recall s that the follow- up question asked SOSI to \u201cprovide other examples for \nhow [it] would apply a project plan for Directory Services\u201d  and asserts that SOSI \nresponded to the question with the required information.   Id.; Protest, exh.  12, SOSI  \nRepresentative Decl. at  3-4.  The record, however,  show s that the actual follow -up \nquestion asked SOSI to \u201cexpand upon how [ it] ha[s] employed tools such as Microsoft \u2019s \nPower [Business Intelligence], Microsoft Power apps, and Elastic to improve the end user\u2019s experience. \u201d  AR, Tab 60d, CO Notes at  4.   \n The protester maintains that  the agency nevertheless failed to consider its response to \nthe question in the overall assessment of SOSI\u2019s oral presentation.   Comments at  21.  \nWe find no basis in the record to support the protester\u2019s position.   In this regard, after \nreviewing the record (including the documentation of the follow -up question and the \nevaluators\u2019 notes ), the protester  now asserts  that its follow -up response \u201cnecessarily \nincluded a discussion of the user experience and additional information about using Microsoft Power [Business Intelligence] and the other tools .\u201d  Id.  This assertion, \nhowever,  is contradicted by the initial recollection of SOSI\u2019s own representative who \nparticipated in the oral presentation.  S ee Protest, exh.  12, SOSI Representative Decl. \nat 4.  Specifically , SOSI\u2019s representative recall ed that SOSI\u2019s response to the follow- up \nquestion addressed how it uses  \u201can internally developed SOS [I] application that \nprovides customers and stakeholders with project status dashboards (using Microsoft \nPower [Business Intelligence]) for large- scale projects .\u201d  Id.  He further recall ed that \nSOSI explained that this application \u201cgives customers and stakeholders transparency into the status of all program aspects, including the status of deliverables, metrics on cybersecurity status and posture, and other program metrics.\u201d  Id.   Notably, this  Page 10    B-423366.2   recollection did not mention whether SOSI\u2019s response included improving the end-user \nexperience  despite this  issue  being flagged during SOSI\u2019s debriefing.   See AR, Tab  57, \nPost-Award Debriefing Slides at  27.  In fact, as noted above, the protester initially \nargued that question 2 and the follow -up question did not ask SOSI to address end- user \nexperiences.  See  Protest at  23. \n \nConsistent with the protester\u2019s initial recollection of its responses to question 2 and the \nfollow- up question, t he evaluators found that SOSI \u201cprovided examples for use of data \ndisplayed in a visual, digestible format, however, the examples were for internal administration and not focused on improving the user experience.\u201d  AR, Tab  54, Oral \nPresentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  The agency  also found that the example \nSOSI gave for a \u201cPower Business Intelligence dashboard was limited to managing the Paid Time Off hours for contract employees.\u201d  Id.  As noted, these findings were also \nsupported by the contemporaneous handwritten notes of the evaluators.  See AR, \nTab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab 60c(1), \nTranscribed Oral Presentation Notes of Evaluator C at  1.  The agency\u2019s consensus \nevaluation of SOSI\u2019s response to question 2, therefore, is consistent not only with the \nindividual evaluators\u2019 contemporaneous record of SOSI\u2019s oral presentation, but also with the protester\u2019s recollection of the response SOSI  provided to the follow -up \nquestion.  To the extent the protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s assessment of the \nmerits of the protester\u2019s oral presentation, such disagreement, without more, is not \nsufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network \nServs., Inc., supra .  \n As another example, question number 3 asked offerors to \u201cdescribe how [they] would \nconstruct a zero trust administrative model\u201d for a specified scenario requiring \nadministrative access to end- user devices , and to \u201c[i]ncorporate any commercially \navailable Microsoft Azure and\/or Entra ID feature configurations to describe [the] proposed design.\u201d  AR, Tab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.  The protester object s \nto the agency\u2019s evaluation of SOSI\u2019s response to question 3, in which the agency found \nas follows : \n \nThis scenario- based question was specific to a public cloud infrastructure, \nbut the offeror answered the question from the perspective of a traditional Active Directory environment.  The offeror identified some key principles necessary for Azure Entra- ID m anagement, but the response was not \nholistically focused on a public cloud as the scenario required.  The offeror \ndid not discuss using attribute- based access controls (which was \nmentioned in the description of Entra- ID) to include objects into \nAdministrat ive Units where access would be delegated or denied as \nappropriate.  \n \nAR, Tab  54, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 7.  SOSI\u2019s presentation for \nquestion 3 received two  ratings of some confidence and one rating of low confidence \nfrom the individual evaluators .  Id. at 9. \n  Page 11    B-423366.2   SOSI argues  that the agency\u2019s criticism  mischaracterizes SOSI\u2019s presentation and \n\u201cdoes not track\u201d the question asked.  Protest  at 24; Comments at  21-22.  We  find that \nthe protester\u2019s assertions  are not supported by the record.  \n \nIn its initial protest filing, the protester  relies on its representative\u2019s  recollection  to assert \nthat SOSI\u2019s response to question 3 \u201caddressed . . . cloud- specific security on a public \ncloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for cloud- native security controls --essential \nfor implementing Zero Trust in such environments.\u201d   Protest at  24, citing Protest, \nexh. 12, SOSI Representative Decl. at  5.  The  contemporaneous notes  of the agency\u2019s \nevaluators , however, consistently  documented that SOSI\u2019s response to question 3 \n\u201c[d]iscussed implementation in a traditional [active directory] forest, not cloud\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t fully cover cloud env[ironment].\u201d  AR, Tab 60a(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation \nNotes of Evaluator  A at 1; AR, Tab  60c(1), Transcribed Oral Presentation Notes of \nEvaluator C at  2.  Moreover, while  the protester initially  assert ed that the question \u201cdid \nnot ask specifically about Azure Entra- ID management ,\u201d Protest at 24, the record shows \nthat the question specifically ask ed that the offeror\u2019s proposed solution \u201c[i] ncorporate \nany commercially  available Microsoft Azure and\/or Entra ID feature configurations .\u201d  AR, \nTab 62, Oral Presentation Questions at  1.   \n After reviewing the agency report (which  included the evaluator s\u2019 notes  and the oral \npresentation questions provided to offerors ), the protester argues  that question 3 \u201cdoes \nnot ask offerors to address this issue from a cloud perspective\u201d because \u201cthe word \n\u2018cloud\u2019 does not even appear in the question.\u201d  Comments at  22.  This new argument, \nhowever, contradicts  both its prior  declaration recalling that  question 3 was \u201ca \nscenario- based question which related to zero- trust implementation of directory services \non a public cloud infrastructure\u201d  and its  initial assertion that its presentation \u201caddressed \n. . . cloud- specific security on a public cloud infrastructure to emphasize the need for \ncloud- native security controls .\u201d  Protest at  24; Protest, exh. 12, SOSI Representative \nDecl. at  5 (emphasis added) .  Further, question 3 specifically  asked offerors to \nincorporate \u201cMicrosoft Azure and\/or Entra ID,\u201d which are a cloud computing platform and a cloud- based access management  service , respectively.  See  \nhttps:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en -us\/resources\/cloud- computing- dictionary\/what -is-azure \n(last visited June 2, 2025); https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en -us\/entra\/fundamentals\/whatis  \n(last visited June 2, 2025) .  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably  assigned \nlow to some confidence ratings  for the protester\u2019s response to question 3 for, among \nother things, failing to propose a cloud- based solution as required.  \n In sum, based on our review of the record, including the contemporaneous evaluator notes, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation of SOSI\u2019s oral presentation.  Accordingly, we deny this protest ground.   \n Remaining Challenges  \n SOSI also  challenges  the agency\u2019s evaluation of the firm\u2019s proposal under the \nbetterment factor  and argues that the agency unreasonably excluded the proposal from \nthe best -value tradeoff analysis.  Protest at  27-30, 35- 38.  The protester also argues  Page 12    B-423366.2   that the agency unreasonably failed to meaningfully investigate and identify  the \nawardee\u2019s OCI.  Id. at 30-33.  As noted above, the solicitation stated that a proposal \nrated low or some confidence for the oral presentation factor would not be considered \nfor award.  TOPR at  18.  Because we find that the agency reasonably  excluded the \nprotester\u2019s proposal  from further consideration based on the rating of some confidence \nassigned to SOSI\u2019s oral presentation,  we find that  the protester  was not competitively \nprejudiced by any errors with respect to other aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nSOSI \u2019s proposal .  In this regard, even if the protester could show that other aspects of \nthe evaluation of its proposal were unreasonable, its proposal was properly eliminated from further consideration for award.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where n one is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a \nprotest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency\u2019s actions arguably \nwere improper.  Zolon PCS, LLC , B-419283, Jan.  14, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  26 at  8; \nVSolvit, LLC, supra.  at 6.   \n SOSI is also not an interested party to challenge the agency\u2019s evaluation of Peraton\u2019s proposal.  In order for a protest to be considered by our Office, a protester must be an interested party, meaning it must have a direct economic interest in the resolut ion of a \nprotest issue.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.0(a).  A protester is an interested party to challenge the \nevaluation of an awardee\u2019s proposal only where there is a reasonable possibility that the protester\u2019s proposal would be in line for award if the protest were to be sustained.  \nVerisys Corp. , B-413204.5 et al., Oct. 2, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  338 at  13.  Where there is \nan acceptable offeror that would be in line for the award ahead of the protester if the protester\u2019s challenge to the award were to be sustained, the protester\u2019s interest is too remote to qualify as an interested party.

Here, there was another \ntechnically acceptable offeror whose proposal received the rating of high confidence under each of the first three non- cost\/price evaluation factors.  See AR, Tab  55, TODD \nat 35.  This offer or\u2019s proposal would be next in line for award if SOSI\u2019s allegations were \nsustained.  Accordingly, based on our conclusion that the agency reasonably found SOSI\u2019s proposal ineligible for award, we conclude that SOSI is not an interested party to challenge the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposal because it would not be in line for contract award were its protest to be sustained.    \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n "

        "Summary":"1.  Protest  arguments  challenging various aspects of the agency \u2019s evaluation of the \nawardee \u2019s proposal and best -value tradeoff decision are dismissed as legally \ninsufficient where the protest grounds are insufficient and rely on speculative allegations \nconcerning the awardee\u2019 s proposed price.  \n 2.  Protest alleging that the agency failed to adequately assess and address an alleged conflict of interest is denied where the agency meaningfully considered the allegation and reasonably concluded that no conflict of interest existed.  \nDECISION  \n AIX Tech, LLC, a small business of Brambleton, Virginia, protests the issuance of a task order to Defense Solutions Group, LLC (DSG),\n1 of Virginia Beach, Virginia , under \nrequest for proposals (RFP) No.  832369148, issued by the Department of Defense, \nDefense Information Systems Agency (DISA) , to provide strategic advisory support  to \nthe agency \u2019s program executive office transport .

The entire decision has been \napproved for public release.  Page 2    B-423417  et al.  decision.  AIX also alleges that DSG failed to disclose, and DISA failed to properly \nevaluate, a conflict of interest.  \n \nWe dismiss the protest in part and deny it in part.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On October 18, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \nsection 16.505, DISA issued the RFP to small business holders of DISA \u2019s ENCORE III \nmultiple -award indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   COS\/MOL at 1.  \nThe RFP sought a contractor to provide strategic advisory support  service s.  Id. at 2.  \nThe RFP contemplated the issuance of a fixed- price task order with a 1- year base \nperiod and four 1- year option periods.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1a, RFP at 1.\n2   \n \nThe RFP established that award would be made on the basis of a best -value tradeoff, \nconsidering  two factors, technical\/management approach and cost\/price, with the \ntechnical\/management approach factor considered to be more important than \ncost\/price.  RFP at 7.  The technical\/management approach factor consisted of the \nfollowing four subfactors, listed in descending order of importance:  program and project \nplanning and execution and risk management  (referred to here as the program and \nproject planning subfactor) ; change and configuration management; knowledge \nmanagement division support; and task order management.  Id. at 7-8.   \n \nRelevant here, for the program and project planning subfactor, the RFP provided the \nagency would evaluate the offeror \u2019s \u201cability to monitor program execution . . .  while \nmanaging known and unknown program risk .\u201d  RFP at 7.  As also relevant here, for the \ntask order management subfactor, DISA would consider  whether the offeror \u2019s proposal \nincluded an appropriate mix of labor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours to \nmeet the task order requirements.3  Id. at 8.  The RFP provided:  \u201c As a performance-\nbased acquisition, offerors are encouraged to review the solicitation to determine the \nmost appropriate staffing mix and hours based on their unique approaches to \nperforming the work.\u201d  Id.   The solicitation continued:  \u201cIt is the responsibility of the \nofferor to propose a technical approach with the appropriate ENCORE III ID\/IQ labor categories and number of hours.\u201d  Id.    \n As for the price factor, the RFP stated that price proposals would be evaluated to determine if they we re reasonable and complete, with reasonableness assessed in \naccordance with FAR section 15.404.  RFP at 10.  Additionally, the RFP provided that DISA reserved the right to, but was not obligated to, conduct a realism analysis.  Id.  \n \n2 The agency issued four amendments to the RFP.  All citations to the RFP in this \ndecision refer to the conformed version of the RFP, submitted as agency report tab 1a.   \n3 Similarly, the RFP stated that DISA would evaluate the offeror \u2019s mix of labor \ncategories and hours to assess whether the proposed approach was feasible, low risk, and met or exceeded the agency \u2019s requirements.  RFP at 9.    Page 3    B-423417  et al.  As also relevant here, the RFP required offerors to state in their proposals whether any \npotential or actual organizational and consultant conflicts  of interest, as described in \nFAR subpart 9.5, existed for the procurement.  RFP at 2.   \n AIX and DSG submitted proposals prior to the November 25, 2024 closing date, and the agency evaluated their  proposals as follows:  \n \n AIX DSG  \nTechnical\/Management  Approach    \nProgram and Project Planning  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nChange and Configuration \nManagement  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nKnowledge Management Division \nSupport  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nTask Order Management  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nCost\/Price  $107,503,351  $58,807,057  \n Protest, exh. B, Debriefing at 1.   After evaluating the offerors \u2019 proposals, DISA \ndetermined that DSG \u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior to AIX Tech\u2019s \nproposal and significantly lower priced.\u201d  Id. at 6; see also Protest, exh.  G, Redacted \nSource Selection Decision at  16.  DISA concluded that DSG \u2019s proposal represented the \nbest value, and it issued the task order to DSG.  \n After requesting and receiving a debriefing, AIX filed this protest.\n4 \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \nAIX protests various aspects of the agency \u2019s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal under the \ntechnical\/management  approach subfactors  and price, as well as the best -value tradeoff \ndecision.5  Additionally, AIX contends that DSG failed to disclose-- and DISA failed to \nassess--a conflict of interest arising out of a personal relationship between an owner of LightGrid ( a joint venture member of DSG) and an agency employee.  For the reasons \ndiscussed below, we dismiss AIX \u2019s challenges to DISA \u2019s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal  \n \n4 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $3 5 million.   Accordingly, this \nprocurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders \nunder multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of \nthe United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B) . \n5 In its initial protest, AIX co mplained that DISA abused its discretion by electing not to \nconduct a price realism analysis.  Protest at 16- 17.  Subsequently, the protester \nwithdrew the allegation.  Protester \u2019s Resp. at 8 n.2.    Page 4    B-423417  et al.  and t he best -value tradeoff decision.  We deny the protester \u2019s remaining protest ground \nconcerning the alleged conflict of interest.6 \n \nDismissed Protest Grounds  \n Before turning to the merits of AIX \u2019s protest, we address the dismissal of various protest \nallegations .  In its initial protest, AIX challenges DISA\u2019 s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal, \narguing that DISA unreasonably rated DSG \u2019s proposal as high confidence under the \ntechnical\/management approach subfactors , the evaluation was unequal,  the price \nevaluation was flawed, and DISA did not assess the risks associated with DSG \u2019s \nproposal  or its understanding of the requirements.  Protest at 19.  AIX also protest s the \nagency \u2019s best -value tradeoff decision.  Id.  at 19- 22.    \n Before filing the agency report, DISA requested that our Office dismiss these protest \ngrounds  as speculative, factually inaccurate, and failing to set forth a legally sufficient \nbasis of protest .  Req. for Dismissal at 2.  The agency states :  \u201cDespite AIX \u2019s Protest \npurportedly alleging numerous evaluation errors on behalf of the Agency, each and every one of AIX \u2019s unsupported Protest arguments hinges on one fact only, that AIX \u2019s \nprice was 83 [percent]  higher than that of the awardee.\u201d  Id. at 1 (footnote om itted).  \nAfter reviewing the request for dismissal and the protester \u2019s response, we advised the \nparties that in the agency report, DISA need not respond to the allegations concerning DISA\u2019 s evaluation or  best-value tradeoff decision.  GAO Notice Concerning Req. for \nPartial Dismissal.   We address the dismissal of these protest grounds in the below  \nrepresentative examples .   \n \nAt the outset, we note our Bid Protest Regulations require that a protest include a \ndetailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 21.1(c)(4), (f).  That is, a protest must include \nsufficient factual bases to establish a reasonable potential that the protester \u2019s \nallegations may have merit; bare allegations or speculation are insufficient to meet this requirement.

In its protest, AIX \nalleges that \u201cDSG \u2019s proposal could not have met all of the RFP requirements at such a \nlow price\u201d and asserts that DSG \u2019s proposal could not have warranted ratings of high \nconfidence.  Protest at 10.  AIX notes that the RFP required DISA to assess  whether an \nofferor \u2019s proposal allowed for continuity of support and included an appropriate mix of  \nlabor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours , and the protester claims DSG \ncould not have met these requirements at the low price proposed.   Id. at 10- 11.  In \naddition, AIX contends that DSG\u2019s low price demonstrates that it does not understand the requirements, or, in the alternative, if DSG\u2019s technical\/management proposal \ndemonstrated an understanding of the requirements, its price proposal does not align with its technical\/management  proposal.  Id.  at 19.      \n DISA requests dismissal, arguing \u201c[t]he entirety of this argument rests i n the fact that \nDSG \u2019s proposal was lower price d than AIX \u2019s proposal,\u201d and \u201cAIX provides utterly  no \nallegations concerning the actual contents of DSG \u2019s proposal and its staffing approach.\u201d  \nReq. for Dismissal at 2 -3.  The protester responds that it satisfied our  Office \u2019s pleading \nstandards \u201cby making allegations that if uncontradicted establish the likelihood that [the] \nprotest ground [] will prevail.\u201d  Protester \u2019s Resp. at 4- 5.      \n Here,  AIX\u2019s  allegations are speculative because they are based on an unreasonable \ninference, as opposed to any credible evidence, and such speculative allegations do not \nprovide a valid basis of protest .  As noted above, protest allegations based on \nspeculation, factual inaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions fail to meet the requirements of our regulations .  Chugach Logistics -Facility Servs., supra; Chags \nHealth, supra; Xenith Grp., supra.   AIX\u2019s entire argument rests on a comparison of  \nDSG \u2019s lower price to its own pric e, as well as a comparison of the adjectival ratings \nassigned to each offeror\u2019s proposal .  Based on these comparison s, AIX infers that \nDSG \u2019s technical proposal could not have met the agency\u2019s requirements.  Protest at 10.  \nAIX, however, fails to establish why its own price is the valid benchmark for a technical proposal demonstrating an understanding of the agency\u2019s requirements , or why DSG\u2019s  \ntechnical proposal  is not capable of being rated as high confidence at the price \nproposed.  Instead, AIX offers bald characterizations of DSG\u2019s price as being too low in relation to its own price.  For example, t he protester claims that given \u201cDSG \u2019s unduly \nlow price,\u201d it could not have proposed comparable staff or hours to those proposed by \nAIX.  Id.  at 12.  Again, AIX does not provide any other actual evidence to substantiate \nits claim that DSG price was so low that it could not have proposed qualified staff or a \nsufficient number of labor hours  other than referencing its own price.    \n  Page 6    B-423417  et al.  The inference AIX attempts to draw  is particularly problematic in the context of this \nprocurement.

The problem with the \nprotester\u2019s argument is that the decisions AIX cites in support of this argument all involve procurements where the agency was required to conduct a cost realism analysis, which requires assessing whether the proposed cost elements  \u201care consistent \nwith the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror \u2019s \ntechnical proposal. \u201d  FAR 15.404- 1(d).  Here, however, t he agency was not required to \nconduct a realism analysis for this fixed- price task order, and the protester has not \nidentified any language in the RFP that otherwise required such analysis.   Accordingly, \nwe consider the argument also legally insufficient.  \n All in all, AIX\u2019s various challenges concerning the agency\u2019s evaluation of DSG\u2019s \ntechnical\/management proposal and understanding of the requirements are dismissed as insufficient and speculative.  \n \nPrice Evaluation Challenges   \n \nWe next address AIX \u2019s challenge to DISA \u2019s price evaluation.  The protester argues the \nprice evaluation was unreasonable because the agency failed to meaningfully compare \nthe offerors \u2019 proposed labor hours and labor categories --as required by the RFP.  \nProtest at  13.

In this regard, the protester maintains \nthat its proposal was technically superior  to DSG \u2019s, and the agency was therefore \nrequired to consider whether the superiority  warranted a price premium.  Id. at 20-21.   \n We dismiss this allegation.  The only evidence that AIX identifies  in support of the \nallegation that its proposal was technically superior  are its arguments challenging the \nagency \u2019s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal, which we have dis missed  for the reasons \ndiscussed above.\n8  With no evidence that DISA improperly relied on price in making the \naward decision, the allegation is factually insufficient.

The technical\/management approach factor consisted of the \nfollowing four subfactors, listed in descending order of importance:  program and project \nplanning and execution and risk management  (referred to here as the program and \nproject planning subfactor) ; change and configuration management; knowledge \nmanagement division support; and task order management.

DISA concluded that DSG \u2019s proposal represented the \nbest value, and it issued the task order to DSG.  \n After requesting and receiving a debriefing, AIX filed this protest.\n4 \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \nAIX protests various aspects of the agency \u2019s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal under the \ntechnical\/management  approach subfactors  and price, as well as the best -value tradeoff \ndecision.5  Additionally, AIX contends that DSG failed to disclose-- and DISA failed to \nassess--a conflict of interest arising out of a personal relationship between an owner of LightGrid ( a joint venture member of DSG) and an agency employee.

In its initial protest, AIX challenges DISA\u2019 s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal, \narguing that DISA unreasonably rated DSG \u2019s proposal as high confidence under the \ntechnical\/management approach subfactors , the evaluation was unequal,  the price \nevaluation was flawed, and DISA did not assess the risks associated with DSG \u2019s \nproposal  or its understanding of the requirements.  Protest at 19.  AIX also protest s the \nagency \u2019s best -value tradeoff decision.  Id.  at 19- 22.    \n Before filing the agency report, DISA requested that our Office dismiss these protest \ngrounds  as speculative, factually inaccurate, and failing to set forth a legally sufficient \nbasis of protest .

In its protest, AIX \nalleges that \u201cDSG \u2019s proposal could not have met all of the RFP requirements at such a \nlow price\u201d and asserts that DSG \u2019s proposal could not have warranted ratings of high \nconfidence.  Protest at 10.  AIX notes that the RFP required DISA to assess  whether an \nofferor \u2019s proposal allowed for continuity of support and included an appropriate mix of  \nlabor categories, labor skill mix, and number of hours , and the protester claims DSG \ncould not have met these requirements at the low price proposed.   Id. at 10- 11.  In \naddition, AIX contends that DSG\u2019s low price demonstrates that it does not understand the requirements, or, in the alternative, if DSG\u2019s technical\/management proposal \ndemonstrated an understanding of the requirements, its price proposal does not align with its technical\/management  proposal.  Id.  at 19.      \n DISA requests dismissal, arguing \u201c[t]he entirety of this argument rests i n the fact that \nDSG \u2019s proposal was lower price d than AIX \u2019s proposal,\u201d and \u201cAIX provides utterly  no \nallegations concerning the actual contents of DSG \u2019s proposal and its staffing approach.\u201d  \nReq. for Dismissal at 2 -3.  The protester responds that it satisfied our  Office \u2019s pleading \nstandards \u201cby making allegations that if uncontradicted establish the likelihood that [the] \nprotest ground [] will prevail.\u201d  Protester \u2019s Resp. at 4- 5.      \n Here,  AIX\u2019s  allegations are speculative because they are based on an unreasonable \ninference, as opposed to any credible evidence, and such speculative allegations do not \nprovide a valid basis of protest .  As noted above, protest allegations based on \nspeculation, factual inaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions fail to meet the requirements of our regulations .  Chugach Logistics -Facility Servs., supra; Chags \nHealth, supra; Xenith Grp., supra.   AIX\u2019s entire argument rests on a comparison of  \nDSG \u2019s lower price to its own pric e, as well as a comparison of the adjectival ratings \nassigned to each offeror\u2019s proposal .  Based on these comparison s, AIX infers that \nDSG \u2019s technical proposal could not have met the agency\u2019s requirements.  Protest at 10.  \nAIX, however, fails to establish why its own price is the valid benchmark for a technical proposal demonstrating an understanding of the agency\u2019s requirements , or why DSG\u2019s  \ntechnical proposal  is not capable of being rated as high confidence at the price \nproposed.  Instead, AIX offers bald characterizations of DSG\u2019s price as being too low in relation to its own price.  For example, t he protester claims that given \u201cDSG \u2019s unduly \nlow price,\u201d it could not have proposed comparable staff or hours to those proposed by \nAIX.  Id.  at 12.  Again, AIX does not provide any other actual evidence to substantiate \nits claim that DSG price was so low that it could not have proposed qualified staff or a \nsufficient number of labor hours  other than referencing its own price.    \n  Page 6    B-423417  et al.  The inference AIX attempts to draw  is particularly problematic in the context of this \nprocurement.  As noted above, t he RFP indicated that the procurement was \u201ca \nperformance- based acquisition\u201d and encouraged offerors to develop their staffing level \nand approaches  based on \u201c their unique approaches to performing the work.\u201d   RFP at 8.  \nGiven that the solicitation contemplated different and unique approaches and solutions, \nit comes as no surprise that two offerors such as AIX and DSG might have different soluti ons and different prices, and that those differences might be significant.  \nAccordingly, w e consider  these protest grounds speculative because they require us to \ninfer that the agency unreasonably evaluated DSG \u2019s proposal based entirely on the \nsingular fact that DSG\u2019s price  was lower than that proposed by AIX .\n7  See International \nCtr. for Language Studies, Inc. --Recon. , B-418916.2 , Sept. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 294 \nat 4-5 (denying a request for reconsideration of decision that our Office  dismissed as \nspeculative because the protester \u2019s allegations of unreasonable agency evaluation were \nbased on the awardee\u2019 s lower price).  \n Although the protester\u2019s  arguments are styled as challenges to the technical merit of \nDSG\u2019s  proposal , they essentially are arguments that the agency failed to conduct an \nappropriate price realism analysis.

Without any evidence to support these \n \n7 In a corollary argument, AIX contends that the assignment of ratings of high \nconfidence to DSG \u2019s proposal indicates disparate treatment.  The protester asserts:  \n\u201cThe Agency must have disparately evaluated DSG and AIX Tech against the evaluation criteria in order to assess the same ratings for the non- price factors.\u201d  Protest \nat 13.  AIX does not claim that the agency unreasonably assessed weaknesses or failed \nto assess strengths  for aspects of its proposal that were substantively indistinguishable \nfrom, or nearly identical to, those contained in another proposal --as is required to allege \ndisparate treatment .  See Cognosante MVH, LLC , B-418986 et al.  Nov. 13, 2020, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 3 at 5.   Instead, AIX asserts that \u201cit is not logical\u201d for  the agency to have \nassigned the proposals identical ratings in light of DSG\u2019s  lower price.  Protest at  14.  \nAIX\u2019s specul ative allegation is, again, based on the awardee\u2019s low price and  does not \nidentify any factual evidence demonstrating unequal treatment.

See International \nCtr. for Language Studies, Inc. --Recon. , supra at 4-5. \n \nAs a final matter , as an alternative argument, AIX contends that the agency failed to \nconsider whether DSG\u2019s technical approach aligned with its price proposal.  Protest at 19 (citing  Earl Indus., LLC , B-309996, B -309996.4, Nov. 5, 2007, 2007 CPD \u00b6 203; \nInformation Ventures,  Inc., B-297276.2 et al. , Mar.  1, 2006, 2006 CPD \u00b6 45; Honeywell \nTech.

The problem with the \nprotester\u2019s argument is that the decisions AIX cites in support of this argument all involve procurements where the agency was required to conduct a cost realism analysis, which requires assessing whether the proposed cost elements  \u201care consistent \nwith the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror \u2019s \ntechnical proposal. \u201d  FAR 15.404- 1(d).  Here, however, t he agency was not required to \nconduct a realism analysis for this fixed- price task order, and the protester has not \nidentified any language in the RFP that otherwise required such analysis.   Accordingly, \nwe consider the argument also legally insufficient.  \n All in all, AIX\u2019s various challenges concerning the agency\u2019s evaluation of DSG\u2019s \ntechnical\/management proposal and understanding of the requirements are dismissed as insufficient and speculative.  \n \nPrice Evaluation Challenges   \n \nWe next address AIX \u2019s challenge to DISA \u2019s price evaluation.  The protester argues the \nprice evaluation was unreasonable because the agency failed to meaningfully compare \nthe offerors \u2019 proposed labor hours and labor categories --as required by the RFP.  \nProtest at  13.  The agency counters that the protester \u2019s arguments conflate the \nevaluation criteria for the task order management subfactor with the evaluation criteria for the price factor .  Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4. \n As noted above, a protest must include a sufficiently detailed statement of the grounds \nsupporting the protest allegations, and the grounds stated must be legally sufficient.   \n4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.1(c)(4),  (f).  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency \naction ( e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.   \nEagle Hill Consulting, LLC , B-421938.2, B -421938.3, Dec. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 288 \nat 4 (dismissing protest ground as legally insufficient where the protester did not identify \nan evaluation criterion with which the agency failed to comply).  \n Here, the RFP provided that DISA would evaluate price proposals to determine if they \nwere reasonable and complete, with reasonableness assessed using the price analysis \ntechniques described in FAR section 15.404.  RFP at 10.  The price evaluation criteria did not contemplate a comparison of proposed labor hours and categories.  Rather, as  \nthe RFP states, such a comparison was required for the task order management \nsubfactor.  Id.  at 8-9.  Consequently, AIX\u2019s argument that the price  evaluation was  Page 8    B-423417  et al.  inconsistent with the terms of the solicitation because the agency did not conduct a \ncomparative analysis of the offerors \u2019 proposed labor hours and labor categories  fails to \nstate a legally sufficient basis of protest.   The argument is dismissed.   Eagle Hill \nConsulting, supra.  \n   \nChallenge to Best -Value Tradeoff Decision  \n Finally, we address AIX \u2019s protest of the best -value tradeoff decision.  The protester \nargues that DISA disregarded the RFP and issued the task order to DSG on a lowest -\nprice technically acceptable basis.  Protest at 20.   In this regard, the protester maintains \nthat its proposal was technically superior  to DSG \u2019s, and the agency was therefore \nrequired to consider whether the superiority  warranted a price premium.  Id. at 20-21.   \n We dismiss this allegation.  The only evidence that AIX identifies  in support of the \nallegation that its proposal was technically superior  are its arguments challenging the \nagency \u2019s evaluation of DSG \u2019s proposal, which we have dis missed  for the reasons \ndiscussed above.\n8  With no evidence that DISA improperly relied on price in making the \naward decision, the allegation is factually insufficient.

Asia Res . Partners , supra at 3-4.  Those facts \nare not present here, as discussed below .  \n11 Although the protester repeatedly asserts that the agency \u2019s investigation of the \nalleged conflict of interest was unreasonable because it occurred after AIX filed its protest (Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 2, 9, 13), our Office has recognized that an \nagency may investigate a possible conflict of interest  after the filing of a bid protest.   \n(continued...)   Page 11    B-423417  et al.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at 5.  Specifically, the contracting officer \nrequested statements from the technical evaluation team members and the contracting officer \u2019s representative concerning their communications with Ms. X about the \nsolicitation.  Id.   The contracting officer found that the evaluators  and the contracting \nofficer \u2019s representative did not have any communications with Ms. X concerning the \nprocurement.  Id.  Similarly, the contracting officer stated that she had not previously \nworked with Ms. X nor had any discussions with Ms. X about this requirement.  Id. at 8.   \n The contracting officer further considered that, as part of an annual financial disclosure process, Ms. X had disclosed her relationship with Mr. X to DISA and been prohibited from participating in matters involving LightGrid without prior authorization.  Consistent with that process, the contracting officer further confirmed that the agency did not  \nauthoriz e Ms. X to participate in this procurement.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest \nMemorandum at  5.  Additionally, the contracting officer obtained a declarat ion from Ms. \nX in which she stated that she did not have \u201cany involvement of any kind with, the RFP or this procurement effort ,\u201d she had no knowledge of the procurement, and she did not \nshare any information concerning the procurement with anyone.  Id. ; AR, Tab  1n, Decl. \nof Ms. X \u00b6 7.  She also wrote that she had  not communicated with Mr. X or any \nemployee of LightGrid about the procurement.  Id.  \u00b6 9.   \n The contracting officer also request ed and received an audit of the agency \u2019s electronic \ndocument management system , and that audit indicated that Ms. X had not access ed or \nviewed any documents pertaining to the RFP.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at 5.  In addition, DISA conducted a search of Ms. X \u2019s emails and \ndetermined that she did not share any information about the procurement with Mr. X or \nany other LightGrid employees.  Id.  at 6.  After conducting this investigation, the \ncontracting officer determined that no conflict of interest existed, and DSG was eligible for award.  Id.  at 9. \n Although the agency concluded that there was no conflict of interest, AIX complains that the agency \u2019s investigation was insufficient because the agency narrowly focused on \nwhether there was  any unequal access to information on the part of DSG , and the \n\u201c[contracting officer] failed to determine if there was a personal conflict of interest  or if \nthere were acts that would affect personal financial interest  associated with award to \nDSG.\u201d  Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest at 2.  We reject this argument because, as \ndiscussed above, the contracting officer investigated and found that Ms. X had no role in the procurement whatsoever.  See generally  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest \nMemorandum.   \n Ms. X was not involved in drafting the solicitation documents, she was not involved in the evaluation, she did not communicate with the DISA personnel responsible for those functions, and she did not access any of the documents for the procurement.

Additionally, the contracting officer responsible for the procurement is \nlocated in a different state from Ms. X and is assigned to a different branch of the agency.  AR, Tab 1, Conflict of Interest Memorandum at  8; Supp. MOL at  4.  In sum, the \ncontracting officer found M s. X was not involved in the instant procurement , did not \nhave access to associated procurement materials , and therefore could not have \nprovided the awardee with any possible advantage.   We find no basis to question the \ncontracting officer\u2019s investigation.  The protester has not established that the \nrelationship between Mr. and Ms. X r esulted in favoritism toward DSG in this \nprocurement . \n In our view, the facts here do not establish any impropriety requiring the exclusion of the \nawardee, or otherwise reflect that the alleged conflict existed and prejudiced the protester .

We find no support for the protester \u2019s \nallegation that the procurement was tainted by a conflict of interest , and we deny this \nprotest ground.\n  \n The protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

Protest s challenging the cancelation of the solicitation, the failure to amend the \nsolicitation, and the establishment of blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) are \ndismissed as untimely.  \n 2.  Allegation that the call order was outside the scope of the BPA is dismissed for failure to state a valid basis of protest where the protester overlooked that the agency \nhad amended the scope of the BPA.  \n 3.

Protest that the agency failed to abide by a stay ordered by the Small Business \nAdministration\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals is dismissed for failure to state a valid basis of protest . \nDECISION  \n CueBid Technologies, Inc., doing business as CueBid BioDefense, a small business of Edinburg, Texas,  protests the Department of the Army\u2019s decision to cancel , rather than \namend, request for quotations (RFQ)  No. W9115125Q0005 for equipment washdown \nservices.  CueBid also protests the establishment of several  blanket purchase \nagreements  (BPA) and the issuance of a call order for equipment sanitization services \nunder the BPA issued  to Titan Associates Group, Inc., of Athens, Tennessee.  The  Page 2 B-423161.7  protester further  asserts that the Army failed to stay performance of the equipment \nwashdown services , as required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) in \nresponse to its earlier protest  of the terms of solicitation No. W9115125Q0005.  The \nprotester also contends that the agency\u2019s issuance of the call order to Titan violated the \nstay of performance put in place by the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Office of \nHearings and Appeals (OHA)  in response to CueBid\u2019s  North American Industry \nClassifica tion System (NAICS) code challenge to that office.  \n \nWe dismiss  the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n When a unit deploys overseas, the Army must wash its equipment to remove debris and hazardous material from all surfaces before disinfecting the equipment to specific agricultural sanitation and disinfection customs standards.  Req. for Dismissal at 2.   On \nNovember 4, 2024, in preparation for a December 2024 deployment, the Army  issued \nRFQ No. W9115125Q0005,  with the intent to award one fixed- price contract for  \noperational washdown services for Army equipment.\n1  Protest, exh. 3, RFQ amend. \n00001 at 1; Req. for Dismissal at 3 .  The closing date for receipt of quotations was \nNovember 8, and the period of performance was November 12- 15.  Id.   \n On November  6, CueBid protested the terms of  the solicitation  with our Office , assert ing \nthat the RFQ  requirements were  ambiguous  and violate d procurement law and \nregulation.   See Protest, exh. 11, Initial Protest.  On November 13 , CueBid challenged  \nthe NAICS code assigned to the solicitation with SBA\u2019s OHA.  Protest, exh. 8, CueBid \nNAICS Appeal; see also exh. 10, OHA Order at 1 n.1 (noting that the after -hours filing \non November 12 was counted as having been filed on November 13).  On \nNovember  15--one week after the November 8 closing date for receipt of quotations --\nOHA ordered a stay of the closing date of receipt of quotations  pending the resolution of \nthe NAICS code challenge.  Protest, exh. 10, OHA Order at 2.   \n Rather than amend the RFQ, the Army used troop labor to accomplish the washdown services.  Req. for Dismissal at 3.  On November 15, after Army personnel had \ncompleted washing the machinery, the Army issued a call order for sanitation services \nto Titan under an existing BPA.\n2  Req. For Dismissal, exh. 1, BPA Call Order at 1.  That \n \n1 The parties briefed at length differing views on whether the RFQ included only \nwashing services or both washing and sanitizing services.  Compare Protest at 9 (\u201c[t]he \ninitial solicitation required washing and sanitizing 276 pieces of equipment\u201d) with Req. \nfor Dismissal at 2 (stating that \u201crequest for quotations no. W91151- 25-Q-0005\u201d was for \n\u201coperational washdown services \u201d).  We need not consider this issue because it has no \nrelevance to our resolution of the protest.  \n \n2 On June 16, 2023, the Army established three BPAs ( Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001, -2002, \nand -2003)  with economically disadvantaged women- owned businesses, including \nTitan.  Reply to Objection at 7.   BPA No. W91248- 23-A-2001 was issued to Titan.   Page 3 B-423161.7  same day, the Army posted notice of the issuance of a  call order to Titan on FPDS .gov--\nthe Federal Procurement Data System .  See Protest, exh. 13, Notice of Award of BPA \nCall Order .  On November 21, the Army requested dismissal of CueBid\u2019s protest \nbecause the agency had used troop labor to perform the washing requirement  and was \ncancelling the solicitation.  Req. for Dismissal, exh. 2, Req. to Dismiss Initial Protest \nat 1.  On November 25, this Office dismissed th e protest .  See CueBid Technologies, \nInc. d\/ b\/a CueBid BioDefense, B -423161 et al., Nov. 25, 2024 (unpublished decision).3   \n \nOn February 19,  2025, CueBid learned of the issuance of the call order to Titan for the \nsanitation services .  Protest at 2.  CueBid filed this protest March 3,  asserting various \nviolations of procurement law and regulation.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nCueBid  alleg es that the agency unreasonably canceled-- and failed to amend--the RFQ  \nand that  the agency\u2019s establishment of the three BPAs  was improper .  We dismiss \nthose allegations as untimely.  We dismiss as failing to state a valid basis of protest the \nallegation that the issuance of a call order to satisfy this  requirement was outside the \nscope of the of the BPA .  CueBid argues that the issuance of the call  order to Titan was \nimproper ; the protester is not an interested party to bring that  challenge, and we dismiss \nit on that basis.  Finally, CueBid alleges that the agency improperly failed to leave in \nplace the stay s of performance required under CICA and by OHA.   We dismis s the \nallegation related to the CICA stay as not for GAO\u2019s consideration and dismiss the allegation regarding the OHA stay as failing to state a valid basis of protest.\n4   \n \nTimeliness of Challenges to the Cancelation of the Solicitation  \n \nThe Army argues that any challenges to the agency\u2019s decision not to amend the RFQ --\nand to cancel it instead--are untimely.  Reply to Objection at 12- 13, citing  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(2)  (a protest must generally be filed no later than 10 days after the protester \n \n \n3 CueBid request ed reconsideration of that dismissal, asserting that the agency had \nonly stated its intent to cancel the RFQ, but had not yet canceled it .  See  CueBid \nBioDefense--Recon. , B-423161.6, Dec. 30, 2024 (unpublished decision)  at 1.  The \nprotester also assert ed that the individual who signed the memorandum stating that the \nArmy would cancel the solicitation lacked the authority to cancel the RFQ .  See id . at 2.  \nGAO found no legal or factual error that would warrant reconsideration of our decision \ndismissing the protest, and we denied the protester\u2019s request that we reconsider that decision.  Id.  at 3. \n \n4 Over the course of record development, CueBid produced approximately 120 exhibits \nto support a myriad of allegations concerning improper agency conduct .  While we do \nnot address each allegation, we have considered ever y protest ground and find none \nprovides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  \n  Page 4 B-423161.7  knew or should have known the basis of protest).  The agency notes that it posted \nnotice of the cancelation to SAM.gov on November 26, 2024.5  Req. for Dismissal, \nexh. 7, Notice of Cancelation.  The Army  contends that CueBid thus knew on \nNovember  26 the basis for its protest, namely, that instead of amending the solicitation \nthe agency had canceled it.  CueBid did not respond to the agency\u2019s argument  that \nthese allegations are untimely.  See Resp. to Agency Reply (not addressing any issues \nof timeliness) .  Because CueBid did not protest the Army\u2019s November 26, 2024, \ncancelation of the RFQ until March  3, 2025, we agree with the Army that the allegations \nrelated to the cancelation are untimely  and dismiss them .6  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2) . \n \nAllegations Regarding the Establishment of the BPAs  \n \nCueBid asserts various challenges to the establishment of BPA s with Titan and two \nother firms .  The Army contends these  allegations are likewise untimely.  Reply to \nObjection at 16, citing  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).   The record includes CueBid\u2019s search of \nFPDS, using \u201c W9124823A2001\u201d as the search term.  Protest, exh. 12a, FP DS Award \nRecords, Feb. 18, 2025.  That identifier --W9124823A2001--is the number of the BPA \nthe Army issued Titan.  Protest, exh. 12a, FPDS Award Records, Feb. 18, 2025,  at 1.  It \nis thus clear from the record that CueBid  knew of the establishment of the BPA with \nTitan no later than February  18.  Any challenge to the establishment of the BPA w as \ntimely only if filed within 10 days of February 18, or February 28.  Because CueBid\u2019s \nchallenges  were filed on March 3, we agree with the agency that these allegations are \nalso untimely, and we dismiss them.   \n \n \n5 SAM.gov (System for Award Management) is the current governmentwide point of \nentry and serves as the single point where government business opportunities greater \nthan $25,000, including synopses of proposed contract actions, solicitations, and associated information, can be accessed electronic ally by the public.  Federal \nAcquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101; Correct Sols., LLC , B-421533, May 31, 2023, 2023 \nCPD \u00b6 133 at 2 n.1.  \n \n6 We also note that the Army\u2019s rationale for canceling the RFQ in lieu of amending it \nwas that there was insufficient time to amend the RFQ and then wash, sanitize, inspect, \ntransport, and load for shipment 276 pieces of equipment in time for the planned deployment.  Reply to Objection at 9- 10.  We have previously found a similar rationale \nfor canceling a solicitation reasonable.  Henry's Aerial Serv., Inc.; Evergreen Flying Servs., Inc ., B-414238.7, B -414238.9, Aug.  10, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  257 at 8  (denying \nprotest of an agency \u2019s cancellation of a solicitation in response to a prior protest where \nthe agency had insufficient time to conduct a reevaluation of proposals before its time-sensitive requirements changed and where another procurement vehicle was available to fulfill its needs).    Page 5 B-423161.7  Allegation that Requirement Being Satisfied Was Out of Scope of BPA  \n \nCueBid asserts that, in issuing call order No. W9115125F0010 to Titan, the Army \nunreasonably used a BPA intended for use by the XVIII Airborne Corps to support a requirement of the III  Armored Corps, thus exceeding the scope of the procurement \nvehicle.  Protest at 15.  T he Army explains , however,  that the agency amended the \nBPAs to add III Armored Corps as an additional location.  Reply to Objection at 7, citing  \nReq. for Dismissal, exh. 5, BPA amend. P0001 at 5 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this modification is to add III Corps locations and include a list of authorized users\u201d).  The protester does not dispute these facts.  See  Resp. to Agency Reply.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.1(c)(4) and (f), require that a protest include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  These requirements contemplate that protes ters \nwill provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  As noted above, the Army amended the BPA to specifically inc lude support for \nthe III Armored Corps.  As such, the protester relies upon an incorrect fact (the BPA does not authorize support for the III Armored Corps) to support its allegation.  Because the protester\u2019s allegation contains a material factual error, we dismiss th is allegation for \nfailure to state a valid basis of protest.     \n Allegations Regarding the Issuance of the Call Order to Titan \n CueBid asserts other various violations of procurement law and regulation regarding the \nissuance of the call order No. W9115125F0010 for sanitation work to Titan, including, \nfor instance,  that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis .  \nProtest at 11 .  As discussed below, we di smiss the allegation on the basis the protester \nis not an interested party to bring it .   \n Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a), provide that only an \u201cinterested party, \u201d that is, an actual offeror or quoter whose direct economic interest \nwould be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract, may file a protest.   Where a firm would not be in line for the award of a contract (or in this \ninstance, the establishment of a BPA  or the issuance of task orders) even if its protest \nwere sustained, the firm is not an interested party within the meaning of our Bid Protest Regulations.  Foxhole Tech., LLC , B-420718, July 29, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6  203 at 3.  \n Here, the agency limited the competition for the call order to holders of the BPA.  See  \nReply to Objection, exh. 1, decl. of Contracting Officer  at 2 (noting that the agency \u201csent \nRFQs to holders of BPA Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001 P1, - 2002 P1, and - 2003 P1 for the \nsanitation and disinfection of the washed equipment\u201d).  CueBid is not one of the three \nfirms that hold the requisite BPA  and was therefore not included in the competition for \nthe BPA call order that the Army issued to Titan.  As a  non-participant, CueB id had no \ndirect economic interest that was affected by the evaluation error CueBid alleges because it would not have been in line for award even if its allegation was sustained.   Page 6 B-423161.7  Consequently, we dismiss  its argument that the agency failed to perform a proper price \nreasonableness analysis before issuing the call order to Titan on the basis that CueBid \nis not an interested party to bring that  allegation.7  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a).  \n \nChallenges to the Army\u2019s Conduct Regarding the CICA and OHA Stays  \n \nCueBid contends that the agency overrode the CICA stay of performance of the RFQ \nwithout following proper protocol and that issuance of the call  order  to Titan violated the \nOHA stay.   Protest at 5, 7 (\u201cContract Award in Violation of SBA OHA Stay Order \u201d).  The \nprotester argues that \u201c[t]he mandatory stay mechanism is intended to prevent contract \nexecution that would moot a protest or undermine fair competition.\u201d  Protest at  8. \n \nUnder certain circumstances, a protest to this Office triggers what is known as a CICA \nstay of performance.  31 U .S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1).  Unless the head of a procuring activity \nwaives compliance with the required stay, the agency may not award a contract in a procurement after the federal agency \u201chas received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.\u201d  Id .  \nSection 3553(c)(1) only prohibits the agency from awarding a contract resulting from the protested procurement.  AeroSage LLC , B-410648.2, B -410648.3, Mar. 20, 2015, 2015 \nCPD \u00b6 111 at 3.  That regulation does not prohibit the agency from satisfying the same \nor related requirements  included in the procurement through other means.  Id.      \n It is well settled that an agency\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory CICA stay \nrequirement is not a valid basis of protest  to our Office .  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.6 (\u201cGAO does not \nadminister the requirements to withhold award or suspend contract performance.\u201d); \nAeroSage, LLC , B-418292 et al., Feb. 27, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  77 at  11 (an agency\u2019s \nalleged failure to comply with the requirement to withhold award fails to state a valid \nbasis of protest); AeroSage,  LLC; SageCare, Inc. , B-415267.13, B -415267.14, Mar. 19, \n2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6  114 at 5 (same).   The allegation that the Army improperly \ncircumvented the CICA stay of  performance of  the RFQ requirement, while it has no \nsupport  in the record, is not for GAO\u2019s consideration, and we dismiss it.\n8  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.6; AeroSage, LLC , supra.     \n \n \n7 The protester complains of a lack of notice in establishing the underlying BPAs, \nasserting that an \u201cinvitation only vehicle\u201d  circumvents the full and open competition \nrequirement of CICA.  Protest at 16.  Again, challenges to the establishment of the BPAs are untimely.  \n8 Moreover, as noted above, an agency may not award a contract in a procurement \nafter the federal agency \u201chas received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.\u201d  31 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(c)(1).

A n agency\u2019s failure to suspend performance is a \nprocedural defect that does not affect the validity of an award and therefore does not \nprovide a basis to sustain a protest.

Protest that the agency unreasonably issued a call order under the BPA is dismissed \nwhere the protester is not an interested party to assert the allegations.  \n 4.

CueBid also protests the establishment of several  blanket purchase \nagreements  (BPA) and the issuance of a call order for equipment sanitization services \nunder the BPA issued  to Titan Associates Group, Inc., of Athens, Tennessee.  The  Page 2 B-423161.7  protester further  asserts that the Army failed to stay performance of the equipment \nwashdown services , as required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) in \nresponse to its earlier protest  of the terms of solicitation No. W9115125Q0005.  The \nprotester also contends that the agency\u2019s issuance of the call order to Titan violated the \nstay of performance put in place by the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Office of \nHearings and Appeals (OHA)  in response to CueBid\u2019s  North American Industry \nClassifica tion System (NAICS) code challenge to that office.  \n \nWe dismiss  the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n When a unit deploys overseas, the Army must wash its equipment to remove debris and hazardous material from all surfaces before disinfecting the equipment to specific agricultural sanitation and disinfection customs standards.  Req. for Dismissal at 2.   On \nNovember 4, 2024, in preparation for a December 2024 deployment, the Army  issued \nRFQ No. W9115125Q0005,  with the intent to award one fixed- price contract for  \noperational washdown services for Army equipment.\n1  Protest, exh. 3, RFQ amend. \n00001 at 1; Req. for Dismissal at 3 .  The closing date for receipt of quotations was \nNovember 8, and the period of performance was November 12- 15.  Id.   \n On November  6, CueBid protested the terms of  the solicitation  with our Office , assert ing \nthat the RFQ  requirements were  ambiguous  and violate d procurement law and \nregulation.   See Protest, exh. 11, Initial Protest.  On November 13 , CueBid challenged  \nthe NAICS code assigned to the solicitation with SBA\u2019s OHA.  Protest, exh. 8, CueBid \nNAICS Appeal; see also exh. 10, OHA Order at 1 n.1 (noting that the after -hours filing \non November 12 was counted as having been filed on November 13).  On \nNovember  15--one week after the November 8 closing date for receipt of quotations --\nOHA ordered a stay of the closing date of receipt of quotations  pending the resolution of \nthe NAICS code challenge.  Protest, exh. 10, OHA Order at 2.   \n Rather than amend the RFQ, the Army used troop labor to accomplish the washdown services.  Req. for Dismissal at 3.  On November 15, after Army personnel had \ncompleted washing the machinery, the Army issued a call order for sanitation services \nto Titan under an existing BPA.\n2  Req. For Dismissal, exh. 1, BPA Call Order at 1.  That \n \n1 The parties briefed at length differing views on whether the RFQ included only \nwashing services or both washing and sanitizing services.  Compare Protest at 9 (\u201c[t]he \ninitial solicitation required washing and sanitizing 276 pieces of equipment\u201d) with Req. \nfor Dismissal at 2 (stating that \u201crequest for quotations no. W91151- 25-Q-0005\u201d was for \n\u201coperational washdown services \u201d).  We need not consider this issue because it has no \nrelevance to our resolution of the protest.  \n \n2 On June 16, 2023, the Army established three BPAs ( Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001, -2002, \nand -2003)  with economically disadvantaged women- owned businesses, including \nTitan.  Reply to Objection at 7.   BPA No. W91248- 23-A-2001 was issued to Titan.

See Protest, exh. 13, Notice of Award of BPA \nCall Order .  On November 21, the Army requested dismissal of CueBid\u2019s protest \nbecause the agency had used troop labor to perform the washing requirement  and was \ncancelling the solicitation.  Req. for Dismissal, exh. 2, Req. to Dismiss Initial Protest \nat 1.  On November 25, this Office dismissed th e protest .  See CueBid Technologies, \nInc. d\/ b\/a CueBid BioDefense, B -423161 et al., Nov. 25, 2024 (unpublished decision).3   \n \nOn February 19,  2025, CueBid learned of the issuance of the call order to Titan for the \nsanitation services .  Protest at 2.  CueBid filed this protest March 3,  asserting various \nviolations of procurement law and regulation.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nCueBid  alleg es that the agency unreasonably canceled-- and failed to amend--the RFQ  \nand that  the agency\u2019s establishment of the three BPAs  was improper .  We dismiss \nthose allegations as untimely.  We dismiss as failing to state a valid basis of protest the \nallegation that the issuance of a call order to satisfy this  requirement was outside the \nscope of the of the BPA .  CueBid argues that the issuance of the call  order to Titan was \nimproper ; the protester is not an interested party to bring that  challenge, and we dismiss \nit on that basis.  Finally, CueBid alleges that the agency improperly failed to leave in \nplace the stay s of performance required under CICA and by OHA.   We dismis s the \nallegation related to the CICA stay as not for GAO\u2019s consideration and dismiss the allegation regarding the OHA stay as failing to state a valid basis of protest.\n4   \n \nTimeliness of Challenges to the Cancelation of the Solicitation  \n \nThe Army argues that any challenges to the agency\u2019s decision not to amend the RFQ --\nand to cancel it instead--are untimely.  Reply to Objection at 12- 13, citing  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(2)  (a protest must generally be filed no later than 10 days after the protester \n \n \n3 CueBid request ed reconsideration of that dismissal, asserting that the agency had \nonly stated its intent to cancel the RFQ, but had not yet canceled it .  See  CueBid \nBioDefense--Recon. , B-423161.6, Dec. 30, 2024 (unpublished decision)  at 1.  The \nprotester also assert ed that the individual who signed the memorandum stating that the \nArmy would cancel the solicitation lacked the authority to cancel the RFQ .  See id . at 2.  \nGAO found no legal or factual error that would warrant reconsideration of our decision \ndismissing the protest, and we denied the protester\u2019s request that we reconsider that decision.  Id.  at 3. \n \n4 Over the course of record development, CueBid produced approximately 120 exhibits \nto support a myriad of allegations concerning improper agency conduct .  While we do \nnot address each allegation, we have considered ever y protest ground and find none \nprovides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  \n  Page 4 B-423161.7  knew or should have known the basis of protest).  The agency notes that it posted \nnotice of the cancelation to SAM.gov on November 26, 2024.5  Req. for Dismissal, \nexh. 7, Notice of Cancelation.  The Army  contends that CueBid thus knew on \nNovember  26 the basis for its protest, namely, that instead of amending the solicitation \nthe agency had canceled it.  CueBid did not respond to the agency\u2019s argument  that \nthese allegations are untimely.  See Resp. to Agency Reply (not addressing any issues \nof timeliness) .  Because CueBid did not protest the Army\u2019s November 26, 2024, \ncancelation of the RFQ until March  3, 2025, we agree with the Army that the allegations \nrelated to the cancelation are untimely  and dismiss them .6  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2) . \n \nAllegations Regarding the Establishment of the BPAs  \n \nCueBid asserts various challenges to the establishment of BPA s with Titan and two \nother firms .  The Army contends these  allegations are likewise untimely.  Reply to \nObjection at 16, citing  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).   The record includes CueBid\u2019s search of \nFPDS, using \u201c W9124823A2001\u201d as the search term.  Protest, exh. 12a, FP DS Award \nRecords, Feb. 18, 2025.  That identifier --W9124823A2001--is the number of the BPA \nthe Army issued Titan.  Protest, exh. 12a, FPDS Award Records, Feb. 18, 2025,  at 1.  It \nis thus clear from the record that CueBid  knew of the establishment of the BPA with \nTitan no later than February  18.  Any challenge to the establishment of the BPA w as \ntimely only if filed within 10 days of February 18, or February 28.  Because CueBid\u2019s \nchallenges  were filed on March 3, we agree with the agency that these allegations are \nalso untimely, and we dismiss them.   \n \n \n5 SAM.gov (System for Award Management) is the current governmentwide point of \nentry and serves as the single point where government business opportunities greater \nthan $25,000, including synopses of proposed contract actions, solicitations, and associated information, can be accessed electronic ally by the public.

Reply to Objection at 9- 10.  We have previously found a similar rationale \nfor canceling a solicitation reasonable.  Henry's Aerial Serv., Inc.; Evergreen Flying Servs., Inc ., B-414238.7, B -414238.9, Aug.  10, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  257 at 8  (denying \nprotest of an agency \u2019s cancellation of a solicitation in response to a prior protest where \nthe agency had insufficient time to conduct a reevaluation of proposals before its time-sensitive requirements changed and where another procurement vehicle was available to fulfill its needs).    Page 5 B-423161.7  Allegation that Requirement Being Satisfied Was Out of Scope of BPA  \n \nCueBid asserts that, in issuing call order No. W9115125F0010 to Titan, the Army \nunreasonably used a BPA intended for use by the XVIII Airborne Corps to support a requirement of the III  Armored Corps, thus exceeding the scope of the procurement \nvehicle.  Protest at 15.  T he Army explains , however,  that the agency amended the \nBPAs to add III Armored Corps as an additional location.  Reply to Objection at 7, citing  \nReq. for Dismissal, exh. 5, BPA amend. P0001 at 5 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this modification is to add III Corps locations and include a list of authorized users\u201d).  The protester does not dispute these facts.  See  Resp. to Agency Reply.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.1(c)(4) and (f), require that a protest include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  These requirements contemplate that protes ters \nwill provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  As noted above, the Army amended the BPA to specifically inc lude support for \nthe III Armored Corps.  As such, the protester relies upon an incorrect fact (the BPA does not authorize support for the III Armored Corps) to support its allegation.  Because the protester\u2019s allegation contains a material factual error, we dismiss th is allegation for \nfailure to state a valid basis of protest.     \n Allegations Regarding the Issuance of the Call Order to Titan \n CueBid asserts other various violations of procurement law and regulation regarding the \nissuance of the call order No. W9115125F0010 for sanitation work to Titan, including, \nfor instance,  that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis .  \nProtest at 11 .  As discussed below, we di smiss the allegation on the basis the protester \nis not an interested party to bring it .   \n Our Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a), provide that only an \u201cinterested party, \u201d that is, an actual offeror or quoter whose direct economic interest \nwould be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract, may file a protest.   Where a firm would not be in line for the award of a contract (or in this \ninstance, the establishment of a BPA  or the issuance of task orders) even if its protest \nwere sustained, the firm is not an interested party within the meaning of our Bid Protest Regulations.  Foxhole Tech., LLC , B-420718, July 29, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6  203 at 3.  \n Here, the agency limited the competition for the call order to holders of the BPA.  See  \nReply to Objection, exh. 1, decl. of Contracting Officer  at 2 (noting that the agency \u201csent \nRFQs to holders of BPA Nos. W91248- 23-A-2001 P1, - 2002 P1, and - 2003 P1 for the \nsanitation and disinfection of the washed equipment\u201d).  CueBid is not one of the three \nfirms that hold the requisite BPA  and was therefore not included in the competition for \nthe BPA call order that the Army issued to Titan.  As a  non-participant, CueB id had no \ndirect economic interest that was affected by the evaluation error CueBid alleges because it would not have been in line for award even if its allegation was sustained.   Page 6 B-423161.7  Consequently, we dismiss  its argument that the agency failed to perform a proper price \nreasonableness analysis before issuing the call order to Titan on the basis that CueBid \nis not an interested party to bring that  allegation.7  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.0(a)(1), 21.1(a).  \n \nChallenges to the Army\u2019s Conduct Regarding the CICA and OHA Stays  \n \nCueBid contends that the agency overrode the CICA stay of performance of the RFQ \nwithout following proper protocol and that issuance of the call  order  to Titan violated the \nOHA stay.   Protest at 5, 7 (\u201cContract Award in Violation of SBA OHA Stay Order \u201d).  The \nprotester argues that \u201c[t]he mandatory stay mechanism is intended to prevent contract \nexecution that would moot a protest or undermine fair competition.\u201d  Protest at  8. \n \nUnder certain circumstances, a protest to this Office triggers what is known as a CICA \nstay of performance.  31 U .S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1).  Unless the head of a procuring activity \nwaives compliance with the required stay, the agency may not award a contract in a procurement after the federal agency \u201chas received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.\u201d  Id .  \nSection 3553(c)(1) only prohibits the agency from awarding a contract resulting from the protested procurement.  AeroSage LLC , B-410648.2, B -410648.3, Mar. 20, 2015, 2015 \nCPD \u00b6 111 at 3.  That regulation does not prohibit the agency from satisfying the same \nor related requirements  included in the procurement through other means.  Id.      \n It is well settled that an agency\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory CICA stay \nrequirement is not a valid basis of protest  to our Office .  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.6 (\u201cGAO does not \nadminister the requirements to withhold award or suspend contract performance.\u201d); \nAeroSage, LLC , B-418292 et al., Feb. 27, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  77 at  11 (an agency\u2019s \nalleged failure to comply with the requirement to withhold award fails to state a valid \nbasis of protest); AeroSage,  LLC; SageCare, Inc. , B-415267.13, B -415267.14, Mar. 19, \n2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6  114 at 5 (same).   The allegation that the Army improperly \ncircumvented the CICA stay of  performance of  the RFQ requirement, while it has no \nsupport  in the record, is not for GAO\u2019s consideration, and we dismiss it.\n8  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.6; AeroSage, LLC , supra.     \n \n \n7 The protester complains of a lack of notice in establishing the underlying BPAs, \nasserting that an \u201cinvitation only vehicle\u201d  circumvents the full and open competition \nrequirement of CICA.  Protest at 16.  Again, challenges to the establishment of the BPAs are untimely.  \n8 Moreover, as noted above, an agency may not award a contract in a procurement \nafter the federal agency \u201chas received notice of a protest with respect to such procurement from the Comptroller General and while the protest is pending.\u201d  31 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(c)(1).

        "Summary":"1.  Protest that solicitation i s restrictive of competition filed after the closing date for the \nreceipt of proposals is dismissed as untimely.   \n 2.  Discussions with protester were meaningful where agency notified protester of the \nareas in its proposal that failed to comply with the solicitation, established a common cut-off date for revised proposals, and indicated that no further opportunity to submit \nrevisions would be provided.    3.  Agency is not required to reopen discussions to permit offeror to addres s deficiency \nfirst introduced in its final proposal revision.   \nDECISION  \n Scott Investigations & Research, LLC, of Omaha, Nebraska, protests the rejection of its  \nproposal submitted in response to request for proposals (RFP) No. SPE3S1- 24-R- 0011, \nissued by the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), for water \ndrinking pouches.  Scott asserts that the solicitation was unnecessarily restrictive, and \nthat the agency failed to provide it with meaningful discussions.    We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation for emergency water pouches on September 13, 2024, as a small business set -aside.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 1.  On  Page 2 B-423342  October 22 , the agency issued amendment 4 to the solicitation,  which changed the \nsolicitation from a small business set -aside, to allow for full and open competition.  AR, \nTab 5, RF P, amend. 4.  The closing date for the receipt of proposals was extended to \nNovember 12.  Id.  \n \nThe solicitation provided for the award of an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity \ncontract to the offeror that submitted the low est-priced, technically acceptable proposal.   \nWith respect to the technical evaluation,  offerors were required to submit a product \ndemonstration model (PDM).  AR, Tab 2, RFP, amend. 1 at 11.  Id.   The PDMs were to \nbe evaluated based on organoleptic qualities such as taste, color, texture, appearance, and overall quality as well as compliance with specifications, including a requirement for a center spout on the water pouch and sterilization requirements.  Id. at 11, 13.  \nOfferors were also required to submit a business proposal for evaluation with a food \ndefense plan, an integrated pest program, and a quality system plan.  Id.  at 11 -12.  For \nprice, offerors were required to provide prices for five tiers , each representing a 1 -year \nperiod of performance.  RFP at 5.   Eight offerors, including Scott, submitted proposals in response to the solicitation.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 5.  Scott \nsubmitted a business proposal, but did not submit a PDM.  Id.  at 5.  Because Scott \nfailed to submit a PDM, Scott\u2019s proposal was not evaluated and was given a rating of \u201cReject .\u201d  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter s at 1.  Subsequently, the agency \nopened discussions , and on December 18 sent Scott  the following notice : \n \nPursuant to [Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR)] 15.307(b), this is the \ngovernment \u2019s formal written notification that discussions are opened . . . .   \nYour firm is afforded the opportunity to address these areas of concern identified by the government.  In addition . . .  Scott Investigations & \nResearch, LLC, may submit any revision, clarification, explanation, or additional information . . . that it may wish to provide at this time.  If your \nfirm does not respond to this notice by the specified date and time, your offer will be evaluated based upon its original submission.  \n    \n* * * * * \n Technical \/PDM:  \n \nPDM evaluation was not conducted. . . .  Scott Investigations & Research, \nLLC did not submit signed amendment or PDMs prior to the time set for \nclosing of offers.   Scott Investigations & Research, LLC is given a rating of \n\u201cReject\u201d as this PDM was not received at DLA Troop Support or DEVCOM \nSC. \n \n* * * * * \n \n  Page 3 B-423342   \nFailure to address the above aspects of your proposal correctly and completely could lead to your company\u2019s proposal being considered technically unacceptable, and therefore not evaluated further for purposes of the award.  \n \n* * * * * \n Submission of any proposal revisions must be received by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time, on or before January 7, 2025 to be considered.   \n Id. at 1-2.   \n Scott submitted its final proposal revision which included a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable.  COS\/MOL at 6; AR, Tab 16, PDM Eval. at 1.  The agency determined that the offered water pouch was unacceptable because it did not have a center spout, and the water  had a plastic chemical flavor.  Id.  On \nFebruary 20, the agency awarded the contract to Ameri Qual Packaging.  AR, \nTab 20, Contract.  Scott was provided a debriefing on February 21 and submitted this protest to our Office the same day.   \n DISCUSSION  Scott protests that the solicitation was restrictive of competition, and that the \nagency failed to engage in meaningful discussions.  As discussed below, Scott\u2019s \nprotest is without merit.\n1 \n \nSolicitation Challenges  \n Scott protests that the sterilization requirements are restrictive of competition because, according to Scott, only Ameri Qual can comply with them.  Scott also \nprotests that the evaluation of the PDMs was improperly based on subjective \norganoleptic qualities  such as taste, instead of the purity of the drinking water.  \n These bases of protest are untimely.  Under our Bid Protest Regulations, a protest challenging an impropriety apparent from the face of the solicitation must be filed prior to the closing date for the receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. 21.2(a)( 1).  \nHere, the sterilization requirements and the fact that the evaluation would be based on organoleptic factors were evident from the solicitation as issued,  and \nthe closing date for the receipt of proposals was November 12, 2024.  Since \n \n1 Scott has raised numerous corollary arguments.  We have considered each of them \nand find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  Our decision discusses the \nprimary issues  raised by Scott .    Page 4 B-423342  Scott did not first raise these issues until its February 21, 2025,  protest with our \nOffice, they are untimely  and are dismissed.   \n \nMeaningful Discussions  \n Scott also protests that the agency failed to hold meaningful discussions.  Scott \nasserts that the agency never  indicated that negotiations were completed or \nallowed Scott to submit a final proposal revision.  Scott states that after \nsubmitting its proposal revision on January 7, it conducted further research and was ready to continue negotiations.  The protester  complains that it wanted the \nopportunity to submit a second PDM  that would meet the solicitation \nrequirements .  Scott notes that the solicitation provided that if an offeror \nsubmitted a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable, and negotiations were held, the offeror would be permitted to submit a second PDM.  The protester asserts that negotiations  were held and Scott\u2019s PDM was evaluated as \nunacceptable so in accordance with the solicitation the agency was required to permit Scott to submit a second PDM.  \n The agency disputes Scott\u2019s allegations.  The agency asserts that it informed Scott  of the deficiencies in its initial proposal, including Scott\u2019s failure to provide a \nPDM, and provided Scott with the opportunity to correct those deficiencies.  COS\/MOL  at 10.  The agency also notes that it provided all offerors a common \ncut-off date to submit final proposal revisions, and did not indicate that further \ndiscussions should be anticipated.  Id.  The agency further asserts that since \nScott failed to provide a PD M with its initial proposal, after the PDM that Scott \nsubmitted with its final proposal revision was evaluated as unacceptable, the \nagency was not required to allow Scott to submit a second PDM.  Id. at 13.   \n On this record, w e find that the agency held meaningful discussions with Scott.   \nDiscussions, when conducted, must identify proposal deficiencies and significant weaknesses that could be addr essed to materially enhance the offeror \u2019s potential \nfor receiving award.   Serco Inc. , B-405280, Oct. 12, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 237 at 1 1.  \nHowever, agencies are not required to reopen discussions to afford an offeror an \nadditional opportunity to revise its proposal where a weakness or deficiency is first introduced in the firm \u2019s revised proposal.   MetalCraft Marine, Inc.,  B-410199,  \nB-410199.2, Nov. 13, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 338 at 10;  Raytheon Co. , B-403110.3, \nApr. 26, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 96 at 7.    \n Scott \u2019s initial proposal  was evaluated as unacceptable because Scott did not \nprovide, among other things, the required PDM.  The agency opened discussions and advised Scott that it was required to submit a PDM and  provided Scott the \nopportunity to submit a revised proposal , including a PDM,  that complied with the \nsolicitation requirements.

The \nagency therefore advised Scott of the deficiency in its proposal and provided Scott the opportunity to correct it, thus meeting its obligation to hold meaningful discussions.

Curcio , Esq., and John Sorrenti, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, \nparticipated in the preparation of the decision.  \nDIGEST  \n 1.  Protest that solicitation i s restrictive of competition filed after the closing date for the \nreceipt of proposals is dismissed as untimely.   \n 2.  Discussions with protester were meaningful where agency notified protester of the \nareas in its proposal that failed to comply with the solicitation, established a common cut-off date for revised proposals, and indicated that no further opportunity to submit \nrevisions would be provided.    3.  Agency is not required to reopen discussions to permit offeror to addres s deficiency \nfirst introduced in its final proposal revision.   \nDECISION  \n Scott Investigations & Research, LLC, of Omaha, Nebraska, protests the rejection of its  \nproposal submitted in response to request for proposals (RFP) No. SPE3S1- 24-R- 0011, \nissued by the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), for water \ndrinking pouches.  Scott asserts that the solicitation was unnecessarily restrictive, and \nthat the agency failed to provide it with meaningful discussions.    We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation for emergency water pouches on September 13, 2024, as a small business set -aside.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 1.  On  Page 2 B-423342  October 22 , the agency issued amendment 4 to the solicitation,  which changed the \nsolicitation from a small business set -aside, to allow for full and open competition.  AR, \nTab 5, RF P, amend. 4.  The closing date for the receipt of proposals was extended to \nNovember 12.  Id.  \n \nThe solicitation provided for the award of an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity \ncontract to the offeror that submitted the low est-priced, technically acceptable proposal.   \nWith respect to the technical evaluation,  offerors were required to submit a product \ndemonstration model (PDM).  AR, Tab 2, RFP, amend. 1 at 11.  Id.   The PDMs were to \nbe evaluated based on organoleptic qualities such as taste, color, texture, appearance, and overall quality as well as compliance with specifications, including a requirement for a center spout on the water pouch and sterilization requirements.  Id. at 11, 13.  \nOfferors were also required to submit a business proposal for evaluation with a food \ndefense plan, an integrated pest program, and a quality system plan.  Id.  at 11 -12.  For \nprice, offerors were required to provide prices for five tiers , each representing a 1 -year \nperiod of performance.  RFP at 5.   Eight offerors, including Scott, submitted proposals in response to the solicitation.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 5.  Scott \nsubmitted a business proposal, but did not submit a PDM.  Id.  at 5.  Because Scott \nfailed to submit a PDM, Scott\u2019s proposal was not evaluated and was given a rating of \u201cReject .\u201d  AR, Tab 11, Final Proposal Revision Letter s at 1.  Subsequently, the agency \nopened discussions , and on December 18 sent Scott  the following notice : \n \nPursuant to [Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR)] 15.307(b), this is the \ngovernment \u2019s formal written notification that discussions are opened . . . .   \nYour firm is afforded the opportunity to address these areas of concern identified by the government.  In addition . . .  Scott Investigations & \nResearch, LLC, may submit any revision, clarification, explanation, or additional information . . . that it may wish to provide at this time.  If your \nfirm does not respond to this notice by the specified date and time, your offer will be evaluated based upon its original submission.  \n    \n* * * * * \n Technical \/PDM:  \n \nPDM evaluation was not conducted. . . .  Scott Investigations & Research, \nLLC did not submit signed amendment or PDMs prior to the time set for \nclosing of offers.   Scott Investigations & Research, LLC is given a rating of \n\u201cReject\u201d as this PDM was not received at DLA Troop Support or DEVCOM \nSC. \n \n* * * * * \n \n  Page 3 B-423342   \nFailure to address the above aspects of your proposal correctly and completely could lead to your company\u2019s proposal being considered technically unacceptable, and therefore not evaluated further for purposes of the award.  \n \n* * * * * \n Submission of any proposal revisions must be received by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time, on or before January 7, 2025 to be considered.   \n Id. at 1-2.   \n Scott submitted its final proposal revision which included a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable.  COS\/MOL at 6; AR, Tab 16, PDM Eval. at 1.  The agency determined that the offered water pouch was unacceptable because it did not have a center spout, and the water  had a plastic chemical flavor.  Id.  On \nFebruary 20, the agency awarded the contract to Ameri Qual Packaging.  AR, \nTab 20, Contract.  Scott was provided a debriefing on February 21 and submitted this protest to our Office the same day.   \n DISCUSSION  Scott protests that the solicitation was restrictive of competition, and that the \nagency failed to engage in meaningful discussions.  As discussed below, Scott\u2019s \nprotest is without merit.\n1 \n \nSolicitation Challenges  \n Scott protests that the sterilization requirements are restrictive of competition because, according to Scott, only Ameri Qual can comply with them.  Scott also \nprotests that the evaluation of the PDMs was improperly based on subjective \norganoleptic qualities  such as taste, instead of the purity of the drinking water.  \n These bases of protest are untimely.  Under our Bid Protest Regulations, a protest challenging an impropriety apparent from the face of the solicitation must be filed prior to the closing date for the receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. 21.2(a)( 1).  \nHere, the sterilization requirements and the fact that the evaluation would be based on organoleptic factors were evident from the solicitation as issued,  and \nthe closing date for the receipt of proposals was November 12, 2024.  Since \n \n1 Scott has raised numerous corollary arguments.  We have considered each of them \nand find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  Our decision discusses the \nprimary issues  raised by Scott .    Page 4 B-423342  Scott did not first raise these issues until its February 21, 2025,  protest with our \nOffice, they are untimely  and are dismissed.   \n \nMeaningful Discussions  \n Scott also protests that the agency failed to hold meaningful discussions.  Scott \nasserts that the agency never  indicated that negotiations were completed or \nallowed Scott to submit a final proposal revision.  Scott states that after \nsubmitting its proposal revision on January 7, it conducted further research and was ready to continue negotiations.  The protester  complains that it wanted the \nopportunity to submit a second PDM  that would meet the solicitation \nrequirements .  Scott notes that the solicitation provided that if an offeror \nsubmitted a PDM that was evaluated as unacceptable, and negotiations were held, the offeror would be permitted to submit a second PDM.  The protester asserts that negotiations  were held and Scott\u2019s PDM was evaluated as \nunacceptable so in accordance with the solicitation the agency was required to permit Scott to submit a second PDM.  \n The agency disputes Scott\u2019s allegations.  The agency asserts that it informed Scott  of the deficiencies in its initial proposal, including Scott\u2019s failure to provide a \nPDM, and provided Scott with the opportunity to correct those deficiencies.  COS\/MOL  at 10.  The agency also notes that it provided all offerors a common \ncut-off date to submit final proposal revisions, and did not indicate that further \ndiscussions should be anticipated.  Id.  The agency further asserts that since \nScott failed to provide a PD M with its initial proposal, after the PDM that Scott \nsubmitted with its final proposal revision was evaluated as unacceptable, the \nagency was not required to allow Scott to submit a second PDM.  Id. at 13.   \n On this record, w e find that the agency held meaningful discussions with Scott.   \nDiscussions, when conducted, must identify proposal deficiencies and significant weaknesses that could be addr essed to materially enhance the offeror \u2019s potential \nfor receiving award.   Serco Inc. , B-405280, Oct. 12, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 237 at 1 1.  \nHowever, agencies are not required to reopen discussions to afford an offeror an \nadditional opportunity to revise its proposal where a weakness or deficiency is first introduced in the firm \u2019s revised proposal.

The agency opened discussions and advised Scott that it was required to submit a PDM and  provided Scott the \nopportunity to submit a revised proposal , including a PDM,  that complied with the \nsolicitation requirements.

        "Summary":"1.  Protest that awardee has disqualifying organizational conflicts of interest is sustained where the record shows that the agency unreasonably concluded there was no possibility of a potential conflict arising from the awardee\u2019s performance of a related task order.  \n 2.  Protest challenging agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals is denied where the record shows that the evaluation was reasonable, consistent with the stated evaluation criteria, and adequately documented.  \nDECISION  \n DirectViz Solutions, LLC, of Vienna, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to Peraton, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, under task order proposal request (TOPR) \nNo. W91RUS- 24-R- GCCC, issued by the Department of the Army for information \ntechnology support services for the Army\u2019s Global Cyber Center (GCC).  The protester \nchallenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals and award decision, including the agency\u2019s evaluation of Peraton\u2019s organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs).  \n We sustain the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423366 et al.  BACKGROUND  \n \nThe Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army\u2019s GCC.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 7; Agency  Report (AR), \nTab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.\n1  The \nsolicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army\u2019s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services (CHESS- ITESS) multiple -award, \nindefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation \nanticipated issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort task order with a 1-\nmonth phase- in period, an 11- month base period of performance, three 1 -year option \nperiods, and one additional 6- month option.  Id.  at 2. \n The task order\u2019s scope of work encompassed \u201coperations and maintenance [] functions, as well as integration of emerging and directed technology adoption\u201d for the Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM), as well as \u201ccommon service support, capability management support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  \nAs relevant here, GCC was previously known as the Regional Cyber Center -Continental \nUnited States (RCC- CONUS), one of five Regional Cyber Cent ers (RCCs) under \nNETCOM.\n2  Protest at 1-2; COS\/MOL at  3-4.  The solicitation advised that \u201c[t] here is a \npossibility that this follow- on requirement for GCC will not exercise all of the options and \nwill merge into a separate competed acquisition for a global, consolidated contract\/task order for support across all [ RCCs ].\u201d  TOPR at 1.  In this regard, the solicitation further \nspecified that \u201cpotential, anticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning [RCC- CONUS] from a[n] RCC to a [GCC] that helps support better \ncoordination of digital oper ations across the world.\u201d  TOPR at  1.  The agency states that \nthe purpose of the task order is to build a new GCC that will \u201cultimately replace and \nsubsume the work of the standalone RCCs.\u201d   COS\/MOL at  3. \n The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; \n(4) betterment; and (5) cost\/price.  TOPR at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost\/price \nfactors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost\/price factors, taken \ntogether, were significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation \nof the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign \n \n1 The solicitation was amended four times.  Unless otherwise noted, citations to the \nsolicitation are to the final amended version of the TOPR provided in tab 25 of the \nagency report.  Citations to agency report documents are to the internal page numbers marked in the documents; for documents without consecutive page numbers, we cite to \nthe Adobe PDF page numbers.  \n2 DirectViz was the incumbent contractor for the predecessor task order for \ncybersecurity information technology support services at the RCC -CONUS.   Page 3 B-423366 et al.  confidence ratings (high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence), reflecting the \nagency\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror \u201c understands the requirement, proposes a \nsound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract .\u201d  Id.  at 20.  The \nsolicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence for any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. \n The solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 3, 6-18.  Under phase I, \nofferors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  For demonstrated prior experience, \nofferors were required to provide \u201cup to three contracts\/orders\u201d performed within the past seven years to demonstrate experience applicable to the PWS for this requirement, specifically \u201cPWS 3.0 Technical Requ irements through 3.6.1.14.2.\u201d  Id. at 10.  The \nTOPR informed offerors that referenced contracts \u201cshould be the Offeror\u2019s own experience as a prime or subcontractor\u201d and that \u201cexperience from a proposed subcontractor should not be submitted.\u201d  Id.  A detailed narrative was required to \ndescribe  \u201chow the company\u2019s experience for these contracts\/orders in supporting similar \nefforts in size (approximately 300 [full -time equivalents]  supporting 550,000 customers), \ncomplexity, and scope supporting Federal Government organizations is like this requirement .\u201d  Id.  The solicitation advised that the agency would evaluate offerors\u2019 \nsubmissions under the experience factor by assessing the government\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform the requirements.  Id.  at 20. \n For the key personnel factor, the solicitation required offerors to provide resumes for seven key positions identified in the solicitation that \u201cclearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, \ncertifications, and qualifications.\u201d  Id.  at 10-11.  The agency would assess its level of \nconfidence that the offeror had identified and committed key personnel with appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications based on, among other things, the \u201cTable 2 \nExpert -Level Position Requirements and Table 3 Key Technical Personnel \nCertifications\u201d provided in the PWS.  Id. at 20. \n Only those offerors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both the experience and key personnel factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.  Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and \ncost\/price proposals, and provide oral presentations.  Id. at 11-18.   \n Under the betterment factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose any \u201cbetterments,\u201d defined as \u201cany instance where the proposed solution exceeds the Government\u2019s requirement in a way that is meaningful for the Government.\u201d  Id. at 16, 20.  Offerors were instructed to \u201cprovide information explaining the promise of the \nbetterment and the betterment\u2019s value to the Government.\u201d  Id.  at 16.  The agency \nwould then evaluate \u201cthe value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate \ncyber space operations across the world and all five of the RCCs.\u201d  Id. at 20. \n  Page 4 B-423366 et al.  For oral presentations, offerors were required to \u201cprovide an oral presentation based on \nthe questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 16.  Offerors were further informed that they should be \u201cprepared to \ndiscuss their solutions . . . for Technical Approach and Staffing\u201d to fulfill the government\u2019s requirement.  Id.  As relevant here, the solicitation also stated that oral \npresentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government.\u201d  Id.  In addition, the \nsolicitation noted that oral presentations were intended to be \u201can interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government\u201d and that these exchanges would be \u201cviewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute discussions.\u201d  Id. \nat 17.  The agency would \u201cnot ask questions that will invite or allow the Offeror to \nchange its Proposal\u201d and warned offerors to \u201cnot volunteer any information that might be construed as changing its Proposal.\u201d  Id.  Oral presentations would be evaluated by \nassessing the government\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements \u201cbased on the answers provided to the questions provided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 20.  If an offeror did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral \npresentation, the offeror would not be considered for award.  Id.  at 18.   \n Seven offerors, including DirectViz and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS\/MOL at 20.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the \nagency conducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for offerors to update their phase I \nsubmissions.  Id. at 21; AR, Tab 52, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating \nthe updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including DirectViz and \nPeraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II \nproposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  23; AR, Tab 65, Task \nOrder Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   \n As relevant here, the agency decided not to record the oral presentations, but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) took contemporaneous notes.  COS\/MOL at 23; see AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Evaluators\u2019 Oral Presentation Notes.  \nFollowing the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors\u2019 oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  23; AR, \nTab 64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1.   \n Following the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of DirectViz and Peraton were assigned the following final ratings:  \n \n DirectViz  Peraton  \nDemonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nKey Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nOral Presentation  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nBetterment s 1 1 \nTotal Evaluated Cost\/Price  $225,833,063  $225,089,343  \n AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.    Page 5 B-423366 et al.   \nThe contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the PEB\u2019s technical evaluation reports and concurred with its findings.  Id.  at 1, 12.  The \nSSA then conducted a tradeoff analysis of offerors\u2019 proposals under each technical factor and selected Peraton\u2019s proposal for award, finding that DirectViz\u2019s proposal was \u201cnot sufficiently more advantageous to the Government to warrant payi ng\u201d the price \npremium of $743,719.  Id.  at 39-40.  The SSA noted that, while the two offerors w ere \nassigned the same ratings of high confidence under each of the first three non-cost\/price factors, with one betterment each, Peraton\u2019s proposal provided a better \nvalue.  Id.  at 40.  Specifically, the SSA found that Peraton demonstrated prior \nexperience on contracts with \u201ca larger size, complexity, and scope\u201d and its proposed betterment of automated workflows increased the agency\u2019s confidence that Peraton would provide \u201cexcept ional value\u201d for transitioning the RCC for the continental United \nStates into a GCC.  Id.  Based on these findings, the Army selected Peraton for \nissuance of the task order.  Id. \n The Army provided a debriefing to DirectViz, and this protest followed.\n3   \n DISCUSSION  DirectViz raises numerous challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision.  First, the protester contends that Peraton is precluded from award because of unmitigated OCIs.  The protester also asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposal s under each evaluation factor and failed to sufficiently document offerors\u2019 oral \npresentations.  Finally, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff \ndecision was flawed.   \nAs detailed below, we find that the agency\u2019s OCI analysis of Peraton was unreasonable \nand sustain the protest on that basis.  We have also considered all of the remaining \nissues raised by DirectViz and, while we do not discuss every argument, we find no additional basis on which to sustain the protest.\n4    \n Organizational Conflict of Interest  \n DirectViz contends that the agency failed to meaningfully consider and sufficiently investigate unmitigated OCIs arising from Peraton\u2019s performance under a separate task \n \n3 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this \nprotest is within our Office\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the \nauthority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n4 In addition, we do not discuss here the protester\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s \nbest-value tradeoff analysis, which are rendered academic in light of our decision \nsustaining the challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s OCI.

The protester argues that Peraton improperly failed to \ndisclose these conflicts, and that the agency failed to reasonably investigate them.  Id.  \nAs discussed below, based on our review of the record, we find that the agency failed to \nadequately consider an impaired objectivity OCI arising from Peraton\u2019s work under the ARCYBER task order.  \n The FAR requires contracting officials to identify and evaluate organization conflicts of interests as early as possible, and to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts so as to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the existenc e of conflicting \nroles that might impair a contractor\u2019s objectivity.  FAR 9.504(a), 9.505.  The identification of conflicts of interest is a fact -specific inquiry that requires the exercise of \nconsiderable discretion.  MANDEX, Inc., B -421664 et al., Aug.  16, 2023, 2023 CPD \n\u00b6 201 at  5.  To successfully allege a conflict of interest, a protester must identify hard \nfacts that indicate the existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough.  AAR Mfg. Inc., d\/b\/a AAR Mobility Sys ., B-418339, Mar.  17, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  106 at  5.  Our Office reviews OCI \ninvestigations for reasonableness, and where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether a significant conflict of interest exists, we will not substitute our judgment for  the agency\u2019s absent clear evidence that the agency\u2019s conclusion is \nunreasonable.  Inquiries, Inc.,  B-417415.2, Dec.  30, 2019, 2020 CPD \u00b6  54 at  6. \n  Additional Background \n As noted above, the awardee will be required to provide cybersecurity information \ntechnology support services for the GCC.  The scope of the work, as described in the \nPWS, encompasses \u201coperation and maintenance [] functions, as well as [the] integration of emerging and directed technology adoption, . . . common service support, capability \nmanagement support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  The \nwide range of technical support envisioned also includes capability management support for NETCOM and enterprise services division to provide secure operations for the enterprise network infrastructure.  Id. at 3-9.   \n On December 7, 2023, Peraton was awarded a separate Army task order, under the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated \n \n5 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to consider OCIs arising from \nPeraton\u2019s performance on the predecessor task order to the current ARCYBER task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 73 74.  After reviewing the supplemental agency report,  the protester withdrew its allegation of an impaired objectivity OCI based \non this predecessor task order but maintained that Peraton had biased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  Supp. Comments at 38 n.9.  For the same reasons discussed herein with respect to the allegations of biased ground rules and unequal access OCIs arising from the ARCYBER task order, we find no merit to these OCI assertions arising from the predecessor task order.

The expansive requirements under the \nARCYBER task order include the provision of:  overarching program management support; intelligence support; cyberspace operations support; planning, strategy, policy, and doctrine support; DODIN mi ssion support; readiness, training, and exercises \nsupport; and communication and collaboration support.

Peraton also \n\u201cprovide[s] cyberspace operations support,\u201d not only \u201cfor ARCYBER Headquarters,\u201d but also for \u201cARCYBER subordinate components, service component partners of USCYBERCOM, and other cyber mission partners.\u201d  Id. at 8.   \n In explaining the relevant command relationship between ARCYBER and GCC, the GCC task order PWS explains that ARCYBER is the \u201cprimary Army headquarters responsible for cyberspace operations in support of Army and Joint requirements\u201d and that it serves as t he single point of contact \u201cfor reporting and assessing Army \ncyberspace incidents, events, and operations in Army networks, and for synchronizing and integrating Army responses thereto.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.

Id.  GCC is part of t he 7th Signal Command.  Id.  The GCC PWS further explains \nthat \u201cARCYBER plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, directs, and conducts an integrated defense within all Army networks, and as directed, within the DODIN.\u201d  Id.   \n As relevant here, the solicitation required offerors to \u201cdisclose complete information of any work performed by their company that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition or which could result in a potential [OCI].\u201d  TOPR at  9.  An OCI \nmitigation plan was only required if the firm identified an actual or potential OCI.  Id.  \nPeraton\u2019s proposal stated that it was \u201cnot currently aware of any facts which create any actual or potential [OCI] relating to this opportunity\u201d and thus did not prov ide any OCI \nmitigation plan.  AR, Tab 38, Peraton Proposal General Vol. at  5.   \n Based on DirectViz\u2019s allegations in its initial and second supplemental protests, the contracting officer conducted two rounds of  investigations into potential OCIs arising \nfrom Peraton\u2019s performance of the ARCYBER task order.   COS\/MOL at 27; see \ngenerally, AR, Tab  71, OCI Determination.   After reviewing relevant documents --\nincluding the PWS of each task order, declarations from the technical lead for the GCC task order and the acquisition chief for the ARCYBER task order, and Peraton\u2019s responses to OCI questionnaires --the contracting officer concluded that no OCIs \nexisted.  AR, Tab 71, OCI Determination at  2.  DirectViz disputes this conclusion and \nargues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton\u2019s potential OCIs.  Comments & 2nd Supp.  Protest at 44- 73; Supp. Comments at  48-53.  Page 8 B-423366 et al.    \nImpaired Objectivity OCI  \n The protester argues that Peraton has an unmitigated impaired objectivity OCI.\n6  Our \nOffice has explained that an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm\u2019s ability to \nrender impartial advice to the government would be undermined by the firm\u2019s competing interests.  FAR 9.505(a); AT&T Corp ., B-417107.4, July  2, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  283 at  6.  \nHere, the protester asserts that an OCI arises from the broad cyber support that Peraton provides to ARCYBER, including support for the GCC, one of ARCYBER\u2019s subordinate components.  Protest at  26-30.  In this regard, the protester points to \nspecific provisions in the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton to assist ARCYBER with \n \n6 The protester also alleges that Peraton\u2019s work on the ARCYBER task order also raises \nbiased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  A  biased ground rules \nOCI arises where a firm, as part of its performance of a government contract, has in some sense set the ground rules for the competition for another government contract .  \nFAR 9.505- 1, 9.505- 2.  In these cases, the primary concern is that the firm could skew \nthe competition, whether intentionally or not, in favor of itself.   Systems Made Simple, \nInc., B-412948.2, July  20, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 207 at 6.  DirectViz, however, does not \nprovide any support for its argument that Peraton actually participated in any activity that could have shaped or skewed the requirements for the GCC task order in its favor.  The protester\u2019s inference based on the portions of the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton\u2019s support to develop agency -wide cyber policy and strategy, without more, does \nnot constitute the hard facts  required to evidenc e Peraton\u2019s participation in activities \ngiving rise to a biased ground rules OCI .  See Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, \nSept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  332 at  8 (protester s must identify hard facts that show the \nexistence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough).  \nWe likewise find no basis to sustain the protester\u2019s allegation of an unequal access to information OCI.  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract.  FAR 9.505(b), 9.505- 4; Cyberdata Techs., Inc. , \nB-411070 et al., May  1, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6  150 at  6.  Other than general conjecture \nabout overarching policy and strategic information that Peraton could have encountered \nat planning meetings, DirectViz does not describe any specific information that reasonably constitutes non- public information that could have provided Peraton with a \ncompetitive advantage.  Moreover, with respect to high- level knowledge of the agency\u2019s \ngeneral priorities, the protester has not shown that such information is beyond the unique information, advantages, and capabilities  that a vendor may possess  due to its \nprior experience under a government contract .  The government is not necessarily \nrequired to equalize competition to compensate for such normally occurring \nadvantages , unless there is evidence of preferential treatment or other improper action.  \nSee Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, Sept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  332 at  6; CACI, Inc. -\nFed.,  B-403064.2, Jan.  28, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6  31 at  10.    Page 9 B-423366 et al.  shaping overarching cyber policies and plans for its subordinate components, which \ninclude GCC, creating opportunities for Peraton to influence decisions at the ARCYBER level to benefit Peraton\u2019s work at the GCC.  Id.   The protester also asserts that \nPeraton\u2019s role under the ARCYBER task order allows Peraton to provide biased advice to ARCYBER about deliverables Peraton would provide under the GCC task order.  Id.     \n Based on our review of the record, we agree with the protester that a significant potential conflict  of interest arises from Peraton\u2019s competing roles  under the ARCYBER \nand GCC task orders, which might impair Peraton\u2019s  objectivity  in the performance of its \nobligations under the two task orders.  In this regard, we find that the contracting officer\u2019s conclusions that Peraton is \u201cnot authorized to structure policies for the GCC Government personnel on the ARCYBER Task Order\u201d and \u201cdoes not provide guidance\/advice on how the GCC Task Order [contractor] handles its cyber operations,\u201d  \nsee AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11, are not supported by the record, \nspecifically the express terms of the PWS for the respective task orders.    \n For example, the cyberspace operational support task of the ARCYBER task order explains that ARCYBER cyberspace operations \u201cmaintain[] Operational Control [] over the RCCs\u201d\n7 and \u201cmonitor[] and ingest[] information throughout the RCCs and facilitate[] \ninformation flow directly to the ARCYBER Commander.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  33.  Under this task, however, Peraton as the ARCYBER contractor must \n\u201cassist in cyberspa ce operations planning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing, and \nconducting cyberspace operations and defense of the Army networks,\u201d as well as \u201cdevelop and maintain [standard operating procedures (SOP)] and [tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)]  pertinent to all cyberspace operations services.\u201d  Id.  Peraton \nmust also \u201c[r]eview, assess, and recommend courses of action in response to confirmed, potential threat activity, and unknown\/new vulnerabilities.\u201d  Id.  at 35.   \n At the same time, under the GCC task order, Peraton would support \u201cservices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational support services for both the GCC and the Warfighter.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  28.  Within this task, Peraton would be \nrequir ed to \u201cperform cybersecurity services to secure DODIN -[Army] information \nsystems and networks\u201d as dictated by applicable DOD and Army security policies and procedures, as well as \u201cestablish vulnerability management process to identify, classify, prioritize , remediate and\/or mitigate, verify, and document existing vulnerabilities to the \nnetwork and information systems.\u201d  Id.   \n These overlapping responsibilities set up an inherent conflict of interest and provide an incentive for Peraton to provide biased advice to the government.  For instance, while Peraton assists ARCYBER to develop SOPs and TTPs that would govern cyberspace \noperations at the GCC, Peraton has an incentive to align these policies and procedures \nwith its own capabilities to perform cybersecurity services under the GCC task order.  Moreover, even as Peraton establishes a vulnerability management process for DODIN \n \n7 As explained above, GCC is considered one of the RCCs for the purpose of the \ncommand relationship with respect to ARCYBER.   Page 10 B-423366 et al.  under the GCC task order, it would be in position to \u201c[r]eview, assess, and recommend \ncourses of action in response to . . . vulnerabilities\u201d under the ARCYBER task order, where Peraton would have the opportunity and incentive to favorably assess the vulnerability management process at GCC.  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35. \n As another example, Peraton is required to \u201cassist in planning, coordinating, and synchronizing DODIN operations\u201d under the ARCYBER task order, which includes the responsibility not only to \u201carchitect, build, configure, secure, operate, maintain, and susta in networks and information,\u201d but also to \u201csupport mission assurance efforts, to \ninclude the assessment and implementation of cybersecurity policies [and] programs.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  40.  As part of this effort, Peraton must \n\u201c[c]onduct network and infrastructure plans and assessments  for the adoption and \nimplementation of enterprise services, such as cybersecurity\u201d and \u201c[p]rovide weekly updates\u201d on the \u201cstatus of the implementation plans.\u201d  Id.   \n Under the GCC task order, however, Peraton is responsible for \u201csecur[ing], operat[ing], and maintain[ing]\u201d DODIN\u2019s internet protocol networks in accordance with ARCYBER -\ndeveloped policies and programs, and for providing \u201cOperational Oversight\u201d for the \u201c[c]oordination, partnering, and reporting through other DODIN -[Army] service \nproviders,\u201d including ARCYBER.  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  4, 17.  Thus, as Peraton carries \nout its duty under the ARCYBER task order to assess and implement cybersecurity policies for DODIN operations, it is in a position to favorably assess and report on \nGCC\u2019s implementation of cybersecurity plans, which have been performed by Peraton under the GCC task order.   \n \nA similar conflict arises from Peraton\u2019s duties under the information assurance task of the ARCYBER task order, which include \u201creal -time management and surveillance of the \nArmy\u2019s portion of the DODIN,\u201d and require Peraton to \u201c[c]oordinate with . . . RCCs .  . . \non outages and matters that require escalation to resolve technical deficiencies.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35.  Mirroring this requirement, the GCC task order \nrequires the awardee to provide \u201c24\/7 operational oversight, support, and maintenance of all GCC- managed services residing on the Army\u2019s . . . portion of the DODIN -[Army],\u201d \nincluding the responsibility to \u201ctrack and report incidents\/outages as outlined in the established SOPs, policy, and guidance.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  16.  The GCC contractor \nis also required to \u201cdevelop [after action reports] to document the entirety of the issue, response, and remediation from a holistic perspective across the DODIN which is inclusive of all relevant Service Providers (e.g., . . . ARCYBER . . .).\u201d  Id.  Under these \ninterrelated tasks, it is seemingly possible for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to be put in the position of determining and reporting on whether an outage incident at the GCC --as managed by Peraton as the GCC contractor --requires \n\u201cescalation to resolve technical deficiencies.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order \nat 35.  In such a scenario, Peraton would have both the incentive and the opportunity to \nskew its ARCYBER report to put its work under the GCC task order in the most  \nfavorable light rather than objectively assessing the effectiveness of its own work.  \n  Page 11 B-423366 et al.  The above examples illustrate just a few instances where the interplay between the \nARCYBER task order and the GCC task order could potentially create an impaired objectivity OCI for a contractor performing on both task orders.  In this regard, our Office has sustained allegations of impaired objectivity OCI where the terms of a previously \nawarded contract or task order would require a contractor to advise the agency on work in which it has a competing interest because of its role in the protested award.  Se e \nMANDEX, Inc., supra at 11-12.   \n In MANDEX, we found that the agency\u2019s determination (that there was no impaired \nobjectivity OCI) was unreasonable where the contracting officer failed to consider the full scope of PWS provisions requiring the awardee, performing under a previously awarded task order, to provide input about its work and performance under the protested award.  See id.  In Inquiries, Inc., we sustained an allegation of an impaired \nobjectivity OCI where the role of the awardee\u2019s subcontractor under the protested contract would affect its ability to provide unbiased services under a project \nmanagement task order previously awarded to the subcontractor.  See Inquiries, Inc., \nsupra at 8-9.  Similarly, here, we find that the plain terms of the two task orders\u2019 \nperformance requirements raise a significant potential impaired objectivity OCI, where Peraton\u2019s ability to provide unbiased advice under the ARCYBER task order is impaired by its competing interest as the contractor performing the GCC task order.  \n  Inadequate OCI Investigation  \n The protester also argues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton\u2019s OCI because the contracting officer did not examine the work Peraton performs under \nthe ARCYBER task order in relation to the work it would perform under the GCC task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  44-46, 62- 70.  Based on our review of the \nrecord before us, we agree.   \n Despite the contracting officer\u2019s conclusion that no OCI arises from Peraton\u2019s roles under the two task orders, neither of the two OCI determinations show any analysis with respect to the work required to be performed under the PWSs of the respective task orders.  In this regard, although the contracting officer conducted two rounds of OCI investigations based on the protest allegations, neither OCI determination addresses any of the specific sections of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC PWS that the protester cites as potentially giving rise to an impaired objectivity OCI.  See generally,  \nAR, Tab  71, OCI Determination; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination.  Instead, the \ncontracting officer\u2019s analysis of an impaired objectivity OCI relies entirely on:  (1) conclusory declarations of the contracting officer representative (COR) for the GCC \ntask order and an acquisition official for ARCYBER; (2) self -serving statements from \nPeraton that patently conflict with the plain terms of the PWSs; and (3)  the role of \ngovernment officials providing final sign- off on contractor work products.  See AR, \nTab 71, OCI Determination at  9-10; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11-14.  As \nfurther discussed below, we find the contracting officer\u2019s reliance on these aspects of its investigation without an independent analysis of the respective PWSs to be unreasonable.   Page 12 B-423366 et al.   \nFirst, the record shows that the declarations provided by the GCC task order COR and the ARCYBER acquisition official were entirely conclusory and, like the contracting officer\u2019s OCI determinations, lacked any analysis of the specific PWS provisions, including those painstakingly enumerated by the protester.  See AR, Tab 71w, Decl. of \nGCC COR at  1-2; AR, Tab 71x, Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-2; AR, Tab  81, 2nd \nDecl. of GCC COR at 1 -3; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-4.  For \nexample, both the GCC COR and the ARCYBER Official conclude, without any documented analysis of specific PWS sections, that \u201cARCYBER does not provide guidance or advice on how the GCC handles its cyber operations . . . . [and] ARCYBER does not dictate how the GCC execute any part of its mission.\u201d  AR, Tab 81, 2nd Decl. \nof GCC COR at 2; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  2.  The contracting \nofficer, in his OCI determinations, adopts these conclusory statements without any additional analysis of the work required t o be performed by Peraton under the two task \norders.  However, as discussed above, the declarants\u2019 conclusory remarks are belied by the ARCYBER PWS provisions requiring Peraton to assist ARCYBER in developing policies and strategies governing the cyber operations at the GCC level, as well as the GCC PWS requiring the GCC contractor to take operational direction from ARCYBER.  Thus, we find unreasonable the contracting officer\u2019s wholesale adoption of these declarants\u2019 conclusory statements without independently analyzing the work required under the two task orders.  \n Second, we also find unreasonable the contracting officer\u2019s reliance on Peraton\u2019s responses to OCI questions where the responses plainly conflicted with the terms of the respective PWS.  In this regard, in responding \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking whether \nPeraton \u201cthrough the ARCYBER task order provide[s] advice about GCC cyber \noperations,\u201d Peraton provided a list of areas where it only provides technical support for \u201can inherent Governmental function and responsibility performed only by Government personnel.\u201d   Tab 71y, Peraton Responses to OCI Questions at  3-4.  The plain terms of \nthe ARCYBER task order, however, list those same tasks as part of the contractor\u2019s responsibility.  For example, Peraton states that \u201c Government personnel  in ARCYBER \nHQs are responsible for providing intelligence support to the RCCs\/GCC and for conducting all -source analysis and production support for full spectrum cyberspace \noperations and planning.\u201d  Id. at 4 (emphasis added).  The ARCYBER PWS, however, \nprovides that \u201c[t]he contractor  shall provide all -source intelligence support for the RCCs\u201d \nand \u201c[c]onduct all -source analysis and production support to full spectrum cyberspace \noperations and planning at the RCCs .\u201d  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  25 \n(emphasis added).  The contracting officer\u2019s OCI determination relies on the awardee\u2019s \nself-serving responses without meaningfully considering the actual PWS provisions that \ngave rise to the OCI concerns  and, in so doing, fails to note the inconsistenc ies \nbetween Peraton\u2019s statements a nd the clearly stated PWS requirements under the \nARCYBER task order .  See AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-14.   \n Third, in light of the contracting officer\u2019s failure to recognize any potential OCI from Peraton\u2019s competing roles under the two task orders --as well as Peraton\u2019s statement \nthat it has no OCIs to disclose or mitigate, see AR, Tab  38, Peraton Proposal General  Page 13 B-423366 et al.  Vol. at  5--we find that the OCI concerns here are not mitigated by the contracting \nofficer\u2019s general reliance on the role of agency officials.  In this regard, the contracting \nofficer explains that \u201cany input received [by GCC] from ARCYBER would be from Government personnel only\u201d and that \u201ceven if Peraton did provide support for [the GCC] \ntask order, any product that GCC sends to ARCYBER has to be coordinated and approved\u201d by government officials.  AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12.  The \ncontracting officer further concludes that, because \u201cPeraton\u2019s advice to GCC would be limited to technical, objective advice reviewed by Government personnel,\u201d it \u201ccould not give rise to an opportunity for Peraton to shade that advice to benefit its other contract team .\u201d  Id. at 13.   \n Our Office has explained, however, that the fact that agency officials must approve any recommendations from the contractor does not inherently mitigate the risk that the advice received from the contractor could be biased.  See Inquiries, Inc., supra at  10 \n(\u201cWe conclude that the contracting officer\u2019s blanket reliance on the requirement that changes must be approved by government personnel does not reasonably show that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to the risk of impaired objectivity  \nOCIs.\u201d).  As noted, the purpose of an OCI review is to determine whether a firm\u2019s advice to the government would be impaired by conflicting duties or interests.  AT&T Corp ., \nsupra.   Here, as discussed above, the expansive contractor  responsibilities under the \nARCYBER task order require Peraton to \u201c[p]rovide assistance in the development, inspection, evaluation, and oversight of cybersecurity policies and procedures\u201d for the ARCYBER headquarters and its subordinate components that specifically include the GCC.  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order  at 41.  We conclude that the final approval \nof government personnel for these policies and procedures before they are deployed to \nGCC does not resolve the risk that Peraton\u2019s ability to provide objective advice on such policies and procedures might be impaired by its interest in benefiting Peraton\u2019s work under the GCC task order.  \n Finally, to the extent the contracting officer relied on the fact that the two task orders are administered by two different acquisition offices or the statement that Peraton would not be involved in evaluating contractor performance, we find such reliance to be \nmisplaced.  In this regard, the contracting officer concluded that there is no opportunity for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to direct its work under the GCC task order because the ARCYBER task order was issued under GSA\u2019s OASIS IDIQ contract, which was managed by a contracting office separate from the one managing the GCC task order issued under the Army\u2019s CHESS -ITESS IDIQ contract.  \nAR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-13.  The contracting officer further concluded  \nthat Peraton would not be evaluating its own work because the evaluation of contractor performance in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) \nwill be completed by government personnel without any contractor input or access .  Id. \nat 13-14.   \nIn light of the circumstances here, we find that both of these lines of inquiry are irrelevant  to determining whether there is an impaired objectivity OCI.  Again, the \npurpose of an impaired objectivity OCI review is to determine whether the firm\u2019s advice to the government  in the performance of the requirements would be impaired by  Page 14 B-423366 et al.  conflicting duties or interests.  Here, the fact that the two task orders were issued under \ndifferent contract vehicles or are administered by different contracting offices has no bearing on whether the ability of the same contractor to render objective services under one task order may be impaired by its competing interest in performing the other task order.  Likewise, when questioning whether the contractor would be evaluating its own work, the concern is not with the evaluation of contractor performance in CPARS, but on whether the contractor, during the performance of its duties under one contract, would be tasked with evaluating or assessing its own product or services provided under a different contract.   \n In sum, we find that the contracting officer unreasonably failed to meaningfully consider whether the work Peraton is required to perform under the terms of the respective PWSs of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC task order would impair Peraton\u2019s ability  to provide objective and unbiased services to the agency.  As discussed above, \nthe plain terms of the respective PWSs include several overlapping responsibilities with significant potential for an impaired objectivity OCI in Peraton\u2019s performance of both task orders, yet the contracting officer\u2019s OCI investigation did not address any of these PWS provisions.  In light of this missing analysis, we have no basis to conclude that the OCI determination was reasonable or sufficient .  We therefore sustain the protest on \nthis basis.  \n Demonstrated Prior Experience  \n The protester argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals under the demonstrated prior experience factor.  Specifically, the protester contends that the \nagency failed to give sufficient credit for DirectViz\u2019s highly relevant experience under the incumbent task order.  The protester also asserts that the agency improperly credited the awardee\u2019s proposal for the experience of its subsidiary entities.  Based on our review of the record, we find no merit to these arguments.  \n The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency\u2019s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc., \nB-419271.5 et al., Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  191 at  7.  In reviewing protests of an \naward in a task order competition, we do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria and applicable \nprocurement laws and regulations.  Technatomy Corp.,  B-411583, Sept.  4, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 282 at 4- 5.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation \njudgment, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  \n  Protester\u2019s Incumbent Experience  \n The protester first asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to identify additional distinguishing benefits for DirectViz\u2019s demonstrated prior experience as the contractor  Page 15 B-423366 et al.  currently performing the incumbent effort under the predecessor task order.  Protest \nat 33-40.  In this regard, the protester argues that aspects of its highly similar work \nperformed on the incumbent effort deserved more recognition in the agency\u2019s evaluat ion \nand best -value tradeoff.  Id.; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  15-16.   \n The agency responds that it evaluated the protester\u2019s experience submission reasonably and in accordance with the solicitation.  Specifically, the agency contends that the protester received the highest possible rating based on its incumbent experience and was not entitled to receive any additional credit.  COS\/MOL at  48-50.   \n The record shows that the protester submitted one experience reference in its proposal, describing its incumbent effort on the predecessor task order supporting the Army\u2019s RCC- CONUS.  AR, Tab  27, DirectViz Experience Proposal at  7.  In assigning the \nhighes t rating possible, high confidence, the agency noted that DirectViz\u2019s experience \n\u201cdemonstrated that it is familiar with the Global Cyber Center [] mission.\u201d  AR, Tab 60, \nDirectViz Experience Evaluation at  1.  The agency also found that DirectViz \n\u201cdemonstra ted experience on a contract of similar size and scope with the services \nidentified in [PWS] para[graphs] 3.0 to 3.6.1.14.2.\u201d  Id.  In the comparative analysis of \nDirectViz and Peraton\u2019s proposals, however, the SSA noted that while both offerors received the rating of high confidence under the demonstrated prior experience factor, Peraton\u2019s experience under a contract with the Navy\u2019s  Next Generation Enterprise \nNetwork (NGEN) had \u201ca larger size, complexity, and scope than\u201d the instant requirement.  AR, Tab 65, TODD at  39. \n On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s \nincumbent experience.  First, our Office has explained that there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  Candor Sols., LLC , \nB-417950.5, B -417950.6, May  10, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  199 at  15.  An offeror\u2019s belief that \nits incumbency status entitles it to higher ratings or additional assessed strengths does not provide a basis for finding that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  See id.  \n In addition, the agency explains that the scope of work under the instant solicitation was anticipated to include work beyond the scope of the incumbent task order.  COS\/MOL at 3-5, 48- 49.  In this regard, the solicitation specified that \u201c[a] dditional potential, \nanticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning from a \nRCC to a [GCC] that helps support better coordination of digital operations across the \nworld .\u201d  TOPR at  1; see also id. at 16, 20 (requiring proposed betterments to exceed \nrequirements in a way that is meaningful for the agency \u201cfor transitioning from [a RCC] to a [GCC] that coordinates better digital operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.\u201d).  Based on this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s conclusion that the protester\u2019s incumbent experience did not warrant any extra recognition beyond the assigned rating of high confidence.  \n  Awardee\u2019s Affiliate Experience  \n  Page 16 B-423366 et al.  The protester also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s demonstrated \nprior experience, alleging that the agency improperly credited Peraton for the experience of the firm\u2019s affiliate entities.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  6-15.  The \nrecord shows that Perat on submitted two experience references, both performed by its \nwholly owned subsidiary entities --Peraton Technology Services, Inc. and Peraton \nEnterprise Solutions, LLC.  AR, Tab 39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  The \nprotester argues that Peraton\u2019s proposal did not warrant this credit because it did not clearly show these affiliates\u2019 involvement in the performance of the task order.  Id.   The \nagency responds that the solicitation did not prohibit the submission of affiliate experience as an offeror\u2019s own experience and that Peraton\u2019s proposal sufficiently described the commitment of its affiliate resources for performing the instant requi rement.  Supp. COS\/MOL at  7-30.  Based on our review of the record, we agree \nwith the agency.  \n An agency properly may attribute the experience or past performance of a parent or affiliated company to an offeror where the firm\u2019s proposal demonstrates that the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  Alutiiq Pac., \nLLC, B-409584, B -409584.2, June 18, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6  196 at  4.  The relevant \nconsideration is whether the resources of the parent or affiliated company --its workforce, \nmanagement, facilities or other resources --will be provided or relied upon for contr act \nperformance such that the parent or affiliate will have meaningful involvement in contract performance.  Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023  CPD \u00b6 92.  \n Here, the awardee\u2019s proposal reflects the meaningful involvement of its affiliate entities.  Specifically, Peraton\u2019s demonstrated experience volume explained that Peraton \n\u201cmanages its combined business, including all subsidiaries , with a centralized \nleadership structure, consolidated business systems, and common practices, personnel, and other resources to effectively serve multiple government customers worldwide.\u201d  AR, Tab  39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  Moreover, the proposal expressly \nstated as follows:  \n \n. . . the personnel, resources, and qualifications offered and committed in this proposal, including those in the corporate experience and past performance citations relied on herein--specifically, ARCYBER [Cyberspace Operations Support] Contract, held by Peraton subsidiary Peraton Technology Services Inc., and NGEN Contract, held by Peraton \nsubsidiary Peraton Enterprise Solutions LLC, under its former name, \nPerspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC --are fully available and attributable to \nPeraton for the successf ul performance of the requirements of this \nsolicitation.  \n  Page 17 B-423366 et al.  Id.8  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably relied on the stated \nperformance commitment of Peraton\u2019s affiliate resources to attribute the experience of \nthose affiliated companies to the awardee.    The protester argues that the agency\u2019s arguments in this regard should be disregarded as impermissible post hoc rationalizations because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not include any discussion of Peraton\u2019s affiliate entities.  Supp. Comments at  13-19.  To support its post -protest explanations, the agency submitted a \ndeclaration from the technical chai r of the PEB stating that the evaluators \u201creviewed the \ninformation submitted regarding Peraton\u2019s corporate acquisitions and structure,\u201d and \u201cconcluded that Peraton had demonstrated sufficient integration and reliance on the \naffiliates\u2019 resources to treat their experience as the offeror\u2019s own.\u201d  AR, Tab  83, \nTechnical Chair Decl. at  2-3. \n Our Office has explained that, in reviewing an agency\u2019s evaluation, we will not limit our review to contemporaneously documented evidence, but instead will consider all the information provided, including a party\u2019s arguments and explanations.  American Sys. Corp ., B-420132 et al., Dec. 13, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  387 at  10.  Although we generally \ngive little or no weight to reevaluations and judgments prepared in the heat of the adversarial process, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed rationale for \ncontemporaneous conclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded details, will generally be considered in our review, as long as those explanations are credible and  \nconsistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id.  Here, we find the agency\u2019s post -\nprotest explanation to be credible and consistent with the contemporaneous evaluation \nrecord, which does not include any reason to call into question the commitment of these \naffiliate resources in the performance of the t ask order.\n9 \n \n \n8 Since the solicitation did not require a technical approach proposal, Peraton\u2019s \ncommitment of its subsidiary resources was provided as part of the demonstrated \nexperience volume of its proposal.  \n9 DirectViz also contends that it was improper for the agency to consider one of \nPeraton\u2019s two experience references because it was for work performed under an IDIQ contract rather than an individual task order under that contract.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  12-15.  As the agency points out, however, the solicitation required \nofferors to submit \u201cup to three contracts\/orders\u201d performed within the past seven years to demonstrate their prior experience and to describe how the firm\u2019s \u201cexperience for these contracts\/orders in supporting similar efforts\u201d is like the instant requirement.  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 25; see TOPR at  10.  The language of the solicitation, therefore, \npermitted offerors to submit references by describing work performed at the IDIQ contract level.  Accordingly, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s consideration of Peraton\u2019s experience under an IDIQ contract.   Page 18 B-423366 et al.  Key Personnel Resumes  \n \nThe protester next argues that the agency erroneously assigned a rating of high confidence to the awardee\u2019s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor when Peraton\u2019s proposed virtualization\/cloud computing senior subject matter expert (SME) did not meet the minimum certification requirement.  Protest at  45-47; Comments & 2nd \nSupp. Protest at  16-20.  Specifically, the protester asserts that the solicitation required a \n\u201cVMware Certified Advanced Professional\u201d for this position, but Peraton\u2019s proposed key  \nperson was only a \u201cVMware Certified Professional.\u201d  Id.  The agency responds that the \nprotester mistakenly refers to the requirement for a different position.  In this regard, the Army asserts that the solicitation only required a \u201cVMware Certified Professional\u201d certification (without the \u201cadvanced\u201d designation)  for the  proposed virtualization\/cloud \ncomputing senior SME.  COS\/MOL at  52-54.   \n The solicitation here required offerors to submit resumes for seven key positions, including a \u201c Virtualization\/Cloud Computing Senior [SME] .\u201d  TOPR at  10.  The solicitation \nadvised that submitted resumes \u201cshall clearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications\u201d based on two PWS -provided tables: table 2, expert -level positions \nrequirements, and table 3, key technical personnel certifications.  Id.  at 10-11.  The \nvirtualization\/cloud computing senior SME position only appears on table 3.  AR, Tab 22, \nPWS at  52.  As listed in table 3, the position required a \u201cVMware Certified Professional\u201d \ncertification, as well as a number of cloud- related certifications.  Id .   \n On the other hand, table 2, which described \u201csome functional areas [that] require expert \nlevel expertise,\u201d included the position of a \u201cVirtualization Infrastructure Senior [SME]\u201d among the 16 functional areas\/positions.  Id.  at 50-51.  Table 2 specified that the \nvisualization infrastructure senior SME be a \u201cVMware Certified Advanced Professional.\u201d  \nId. at 51 (emphasis added).  Although the protester argues that the virtualization \ninfrastructure  senior SME in table 2 and the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME \nin table 3 are one and the same key position, the plain reading of the solicitation language does not support this interpretation.  \n Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s actual requirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.  Karthik Consulting, LLC, B -421610.2, May  31, \n2023, 2023  CPD \u00b6 134 at  2.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning \nof solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; t o be reasonable, and therefore \nvalid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole \nand in a reasonable manner.  Crew Training Int \u2019l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb. 7, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6 53 at 4.  An ambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations \nof the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible; a patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error.  FFLPro, LLC,  \nB-411427.2, Sept.  22, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6  289 at  10.  Where a patent ambiguity is not \nchallenged prior to the submission of solicitation responses, we will not consider  Page 19 B-423366 et al.  subsequent untimely arguments asserting the protester\u2019s own interpretation of the \nambiguous provisions.  Id.  \n As an initial matter, we note that the solicitation here required resumes for seven key personnel positions.  However, table 2 lists 16 (not 7) positions and specifies that these positions are for functional areas that require \u201cexpert level expertise.\u201d  AR , Tab 22, PWS \nat 50.  With respect to these positions, the PWS notes that the contractor would be \nrequired to \u201cretain personnel with management and technical knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience needed to accomplish the performance of work under this task order,\u201d but contains no specific proposal submission requirements.  Id.  The PWS \nalso specifically notes that \u201c[s]ome, but not[] all[,] expert -level positions will also be \nidentified as key technical positions.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, a review of the two tables shows little \noverlap between the 16 positions listed in table 2 and the 7 \u201cKey Technical Personnel\u201d \npositions listed in table 3.  Compare id.  at 50-51 with id.  at 52.  For example, the \nrequired key positions of network senior SME and cyber security senior SME are listed among the key personnel positions in table 3 without any directly equivalent positions \namong the expert -level positions in table 2.  Id.  \n Further, the record shows that the two positions --virtualization infrastructure senior SME \nand virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME --have materially different certification \nrequirements in addition to the VMware certification.  The virtualization infrastructure senior SME position requires a \u201c[Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)]:  Core Infrastructure\u201d certification , while the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME requires \na cloud- related certification of \u201cAzure Administrator Associate OR  AWS Certified \nSolutions Architect --Associate . . . OR CompTIA Cloud+\u201d or \u201cMCSE Cloud Platform & \nInfrastructure.\u201d  Id. at 51-52.   \n Reading the solicitation as a whole in a manner that gives effect to these provisions, the only reasonable interpretation is that the virtualization infrastructure senior SME detailed in table 2 and the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME in table 3 are two different \npositions.  Of the two, only the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME is designated \nas a key person to be evaluated under the key personnel resume factor, and this position requires a VMware certification without the \u201cadvanced\u201d designation.  Moreover, even if it was reasonable for the protester to interpret the two positions to be one and the same, solicitation terms providing different certification requirements for the same position would be an obvious or glaring error that constitutes a patent ambiguity, which should have been protested prior to the submission of solicitation responses.  FFLPro, LLC,  supra.   We will not now consider the protester\u2019s untimely arguments asserting its \nown interpretation of the patently ambiguous provisi on.  \n The record here shows --and the protester does not dispute--that Peraton\u2019s resume for \nits proposed virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME had the VMware certified \nprofessional certification.  See AR, Tab  40, Peraton\u2019s Key Personnel Proposal at  13.  \nAccordingly, we find nothing unreasonable in the agency\u2019s finding that the awardee\u2019s proposed virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME satisfied the solicitation\u2019s \ncertification requirement.     Page 20 B-423366 et al.  Betterment  \n \nThe protester next asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to credit DirectViz\u2019s proposal for multiple additional betterments.  Protest at  59-64.  The protester also \ncontends that the agency treated offerors disparately by crediting Peraton with a betterment for proposing data- driven dashboards while failing to credit DirectViz for a \nsimilar aspect of its proposal.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency \nresponds that it evaluated the offerors\u2019 proposed betterments in accordance with the solicitation and asserts that the protester\u2019s arguments amount to nothing more than \ndisagreement with the agency\u2019s reasonable judgment.  COS\/MOL at  73-76; Supp. \nCOS\/MOL at 39-43.  Based on our review of the record, we agree with the agency.  \n As noted above, the solicitation instructed offerors to propose \u201cbetterments,\u201d defined as any instance where the proposed solution exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  TOPR at  16, 20.  Proposed betterments would be evaluated \nfor \u201cthe value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate cyber space operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.\u201d  Id.  at 20.  In evaluating m ultiple \nbetterments listed in DirectViz\u2019s proposal, the agency found that only one of them offered a betterment that exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  See AR, Tab  63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1-2.  While the protester \nclaims that all of its proposed betterments deserved credit, the record provides no basis for questioning the agency\u2019s evaluative judgment.  \n For example, the agency declined to find a betterment in the protester\u2019s proposal of a \ncentralized service delivery for a global network because \u201cit is currently a requirement under [PWS] paragraph 3.3.3.1.\u201d  Id.  at 1.  The agency supplements this record by \nfurther explaining that the protester\u2019s description of its centralized service delivery did not meaningfully exceed the cited PWS requirement for the contractor to \u201cperform . . . support functions to remotely operate, monitor, sustain, and secure the Ent erprise \nnetwork within GCC responsibility boundaries.\u201d  AR, Tab 83, Technical Evaluation \nBoard (TEB) Chair Decl. at  6; AR, Tab 22, PWS  \u00a7 3.3.3.1.  While the protester \ndisagrees with this assessment, it does not meaningfully explain how its proposed betterm ent exceeded the PWS requirement.   \n   \nThe protester also asserts that the agency treated DirectViz and Peraton disparately when the agency credited a betterment for Peraton\u2019s proposed dashboard approach while declining to credit a betterment for a similar aspect of DirectViz\u2019s proposal.  Comme nts & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency responds that the difference in \nthe evaluation is directly attributable to the differences in the offerors\u2019 proposals.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 39-41.   \n It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must treat all  offerors  equally and evaluate proposals  evenhandedly against the solicitation\u2019 s \nrequirements and evaluation criteria.  See UltiSat, Inc., B-416809 et al., Dec.  18, 2018, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 6 at 9.  Where a protester  alleges unequal treatment in a technical  Page 21 B-423366 et al.  evaluation, it must show that the differences in the evaluation did not stem  from \ndifferences between the proposals .  See Camber Corp., B -413505, Nov. 10, 2016, 2016 \nCPD \u00b6 350 at  8.  To prevail on an allegation of disparate treatment, a protester must \nshow that the agency  unreasonably downgraded its proposal  for aspects that were \nsubstantively indistinguishable from, or nearly  identical to, those contained in other \nproposals .  See Battelle Mem'l Inst., B -418047.3, B -418047.4, May  18, 2020,  2020 CPD \n\u00b6 176 at  5. \n \nHere, the agency found one betterment in each of DirectViz\u2019s and Peraton\u2019s proposals.  See AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.  Peraton\u2019s betterment was assessed for the firm\u2019s \napproach to automated workflows, which \u201cuses the Army\u2019s existing tool suite . . . to create data- driven dashboards that enable the Army to fuse, interpret, and visualize \nlarge amount s of data.\u201d  AR, Tab 62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  The \nevaluators detailed their rationale for this finding as follows:  \n \nAs the [GCC] scope of responsibilities grows in breadth and depth, responding to the Army\u2019s information technology needs will become more demanding.  This value- added method provides the GCC with additional \ntechnical experience in the tool suite identified above in the Offeror\u2019s \nproposal.  Also, the method leans on software tools provided by existing systems of record, such as Army 365, thereby preventing further tools adoption ( i.e. tool bloat).  Employing methods that augment system of \nrecords, such as Ar my Enterprise Service Management Platform \n(AESMP), will enable the GCC to perform newer obligations more effectively and efficiently.  This is above what is required in the PWS, \nAppendix C, Table 2: Incident Management Standards, (1)  Critical Incident \nResp onse rates of 94 [percent] within an hour, (2) High-  and medium -\npriority incidents exceed response rates of 92 [percent] within 2 core hours and 5 core hours, respectively.  \n Id.     \n While the protester asserts that it also deserved credit for proposing data- driven \ndashboards, Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32, the record does not support this \nassertion.  In this regard, the agency considered DirectViz\u2019s proposed approach of proposing a \u201c[DELETED]\u201d that will provide \u201c[DELETED],\u201d allowing \u201c[DELETED].\u201d  AR, Tab 63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1 (quoting AR, Tab  33, DirectViz \nBetterment Proposal at  1).  In declining to assess a betterment for this approach, the \nevaluators found that DirectViz\u2019s solution was \u201ccurrently a requirement under PWS paragraph 3.4.2.6, \u201d which required \u201c[c] oordination with Web Services personnel to \ndevelop and maintain visualizations and dashboards in support of operations .\u201d  Id.; \nsee AR, Tab  22, PWS \u00a7  3.4.2.6.   \n The TEB chair further explains the difference between the offerors\u2019 approaches by stating that DirectViz\u2019s dashboard approach was \u201climited to a [DELETED], and did not improve response times for incident management standards.\u201d  AR, Tab 83, TEB Chair  Page 22 B-423366 et al.  Decl. at  6.  In contrast, as noted in the contemporaneous evaluation documentation and \nfurther explained by the TEB chair, Peraton\u2019s proposal \u201cdescribed the implementation of \na Real -Time Performance Monitor dashboard[]\u201d that went beyond the PWS -required \n[DELETED] to provide \u201cimprove[d] response times for incident management standards.\u201d  \nId. at 5; see AR, Tab  62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  Although the protester \ndisagrees with the agency\u2019s assessment of the value in improved response times for incident management, Supp. Comments at  35-38, such disagreement alone does not \nestablish that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  Accordingly, we find no basis to sustain the protester\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation under this factor.  \n Oral Presentations  \n The protester next asserts that the agency failed to maintain an adequate record of oral presentations.  Specifically, DirectViz contends that the Army failed to document the content of oral presentations such that the record lacks an adequate basis on whi ch to \nassess the agency\u2019s evaluation.  Protest at  58-59; Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest \nat 20-28.  The protester also disagrees with several of the agency\u2019s unfavorable findings \nas noted in the agency\u2019s documented evaluation of DirectViz\u2019s oral presentation.   \nProtest at  50-53.  We find the protester\u2019s arguments to be without merit.  \n As an initial matter, in challenging the agency\u2019s documentation of oral presentations, the protester cites to FAR section 15.102(e), which requires agencies to maintain a record \nof oral presentations, and relies in part on our decision in HomeSafe Alliance, LLC , \nB-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  350.  We find, however, that the \nprotester\u2019s reliance on that FAR provision and our decision in HomeSafe  is misplaced \nbecause the procurement at issue here was a task order competition conducted under the procedures of FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task \norder competition under FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less rigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B-421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., \nB-419210, B -419210.2, Dec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 409 at  4-5.   \n Unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted under FAR \npart 15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral presentations \nin task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare \nFAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) \nprovides that contracting officers may \u201cexercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures,\u201d \u201ckeep submission requirements to a minimum,\u201d and \u201cuse streamlined procedures including oral presentations.\u201d  With respect \nto the required documentation in task order competitions, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  \nrequires agencies  only to \u201c document in the contract file the rationale for placement and \nprice of each order, including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs \namong cost or price and non- cost considerations in making the award decision.\u201d   \n Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government,\u201d and, in fact, the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16;  Page 23 B-423366 et al.  COS\/MOL at 62.  The agency instead documented the oral presentations by retaining \nthe contemporaneous handwritten notes of the contracting officer and the three TEB \nmembers, who later convened a panel to prepare a consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  62; see AR, Tab  64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation \nReport; AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Individual Evaluator Notes.\n10   \n Based on our review of this record, we find sufficient contemporaneous documentation of the agency\u2019s evaluative judgments of the offerors\u2019 oral presentations.  Moreover, while the evaluators\u2019 notes do not document every aspect of the offerors\u2019 oral \npresent ations, they do provide the agency\u2019s documentation of the particular aspects of \nthe offerors\u2019 presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluation \njudgments.\n11  Where the solicitation specifically advised offerors that the agency may \nnot record the oral presentations, we see nothing in the applicable laws or regulations that required the agency to go further and record or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR \nsubpart 16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, \nNov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 365 at 7 (\u201cWe see no requirement in law or regulation that an \nagency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart 8.4, and it is not our role to impose one where the FAR does not.\u201d).  \n In addition, while the protester generally challenges every unfavorable finding noted in the evaluation of its oral presentation, we find that the protester\u2019s assertions offer nothing more than its disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluative judgments.  See \nProtest at  50-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  20-28.  The record shows that the \nagency documented several areas that DirectViz\u2019s presentation did not address before \nultimately assigning it the highest possible rating of high confidence.  See AR, Tab  64, \nOral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 12-16.  Despite asserting that it \u201cdisagrees \nwith these findings,\u201d the protester does not offer any specific statements to counter the \nagency\u2019s evaluation conclusions other than to generally aver that the protester \u201cbelieves it fully responded to each oral presentation question and fully addressed every \n \n10 In response to the protester\u2019s complaint that \u201c[m]uch of the evaluators\u2019 notes are \nillegible,\u201d Comments & Supp. Protest at  21, our Office requested that the agency \nprovide typed transcriptions of the evaluators\u2019 handwritten notes, and the agency supplemen ted the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  70a(1), \n70b(1), 70c(1), Transcribed Individual Evaluator Notes.  \n11 We also reject the protester\u2019s assertion that the documentation is inadequate \nbecause the content of the evaluators\u2019 notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments & 2nd Supp. \nProtest at  23-27; Supp. Comments at  33.  It is well -settled that, following discussions \namong evaluators, an agency may reach consensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator\u2019s assessment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; \nsee e.g. , Unitec Distribution Sys ., B-419874, B -419874.2, Aug. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD \n\u00b6 307 at  4; Resource Applications, Inc ., B-274943.3, Mar. 5, 1997, 97- 1 CPD \u00b6 137 at  5.   Page 24 B-423366 et al.  requirement.\u201d  Protest at  50.  Although the protester faults the agency\u2019s failure to \nsufficiently record the details of the oral presentation and argues that the \ncontemporaneous evaluation is unclear and contradictory, the protester does not present any al ternative recollections of the content of its presentation to rebut the \nagency\u2019s documented evaluation.  On this record, we find no basis to fault the agency\u2019s evaluation of DirectViz\u2019s oral presentation.  \n The protester also contends that the agency\u2019s conduct of the oral presentations constituted discussions because, by asking a follow -up question at the end of each oral \npresentation, the agency allowed offerors to revise or add to what was presented, which amounted to allowing revised proposals.  Protest at  51-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. \nProtest at  28-30.  The protester argues that these alleged discussions were misleading \nand not meaningful because the agency asked only one question without affording DirectViz  an opportunity to address other \u201costensible gaps in DVS\u2019s oral presentation.\u201d  \nProtest at  52.  Based on the record before us, we find no merit to the protester\u2019s \ncontention that the agency\u2019s conduct of oral presentations constituted discussions.    As discussed above, the instant task order procurement was conducted under FAR subpart  16.5, and the solicitation specifically warned offerors that \u201cthe contracting \ntechniques under FAR part 15.3 do not apply\u201d and that \u201cFAR 15.3 procedures will not be utilized to review any subsequent award.\u201d  TOPR at  4.  With respect to oral \npresentations, the solicitation advised that the oral presentation was intended to be \u201can interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government,\u201d which would be \u201cviewed as a component of the oral presentation itself [that did] not constitute discussions.\u201d  Id. at 17.  The solicitation further stated that the agency \u201cwill not ask \nquestions that will invite or allow the Offeror to change its Proposal\u201d and prohibited offerors from \u201cvolunteer[ing] any information that might be construed as changing its proposal.\u201d  Id. \n Each of the offerors were asked one follow -up question during oral presentations.  \nCOS\/MOL at 63; see AR, Tab  70d, Contracting Officer\u2019s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.  \nThe agency asserts that these limited follow -up questions were not discussions \nbecause they were specifically limited to clarifying the evaluators\u2019 understanding of the solution presented du ring the presentation and did not permit any proposal revisions.  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 38-39.  For example, the agency asked DirectViz to \u201cexpand upon \n[its] model to deny access to the remaining 550,000 end[ -]user devices for the same \ntouch- labor administrators,\u201d thus seeking more information on the model DirectViz \npresented in response to the third oral presentation question.  AR, Tab 70d, Contracting \nOfficer\u2019 s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.   \n While the protester argues that this question allowed DirectViz to supplement its oral presentations and thus constituted discussions, the protester does not elaborate on how--or even whether --its response to the follow -up question revised its presented \nsolution to the scenario- based oral presentation question.  As the protester points out, \nthe consensus evaluation report did not specifically  discuss DirectViz\u2019s response to the \nfollow- up question, but instead stated the evaluation conclusion that DirectViz  Page 25 B-423366 et al.  \u201cexplained an applicable solution to the problem presented in this question with an \nexpert level of understanding of the Entra ID system.\u201d  AR, Tab 64, Oral Presentation \nFinal Evaluation Report at  12.  The agency further found that DirectViz \u201ccorrectly \nidentified several key areas such as [DELETED], [DELETED], and [DELETED].\u201d  Id.  \nThe protester makes no showing--or even allegation--that it provided any information during the question- and-answer portion of the oral presentation that substantively \nrevised it s proposed solution or the agency\u2019s evaluation thereof.  On this record, we see \nno basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s carefully limited follow -up question constituted \ndiscussions.\n12  Accordingly, since the agency did not engage in discussions, we \nconclude the protester\u2019s allegation that the agency engaged in misleading discussions is without merit.  \n Cost Evaluations  \n The protester also asserts that the agency\u2019s cost realism analysis failed to consider offerors\u2019 unique technical approaches.  Protest at  64-66; Comments & 2nd Supp. \nProtest at  37-39.  We find no basis to sustain this protest ground.  \n When an agency evaluates proposals for the award of a cost -reimbursement contract or \ntask order, it must perform a cost realism analysis to determine the extent to which an offeror\u2019s proposed costs are realistic for the work to be performed.  FAR 15.305(a) (1), \n15.404- 1(d); IAP-C4ISR, LLC, B -421726.2 et al. , Feb.  12, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6  52 at  10.  \nAn offeror\u2019s costs are not dispositive because, regardless of the costs proposed, the government is bound to pay the contractor its actual and allowable costs.  FAR 16.505(b)(3); 15.305(a)(1); Engility Corp ., B-413120.3 et al., Feb.  14, 2017, 2017 CPD \n\u00b6 70 at 18.  An agency\u2019s cost realism analysis requires the exercise of informed \njudgment, and we review an agency\u2019s judgment in this area only to see that the analysis was reasonably based and not arbitrary.  Id .  The analysis need not achieve scientific \ncertainty; rather, the methodology used must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the agency\u2019s conclusions about the most probable costs for  \nan offeror\u2019s proposal are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency at the time of its evaluation.  TeleCommunication \nSys., Inc ., B-413265, B -413265.2, Sept.  21, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  266 at  10. \n In challenging the agency\u2019s cost realism analysis, the protester essentially asserts that the agency\u2019s methodology  was flawed because the Army did not have offerors\u2019 \ntechnical approaches to compare against their respective cost proposals.  We note, however, that the solicitation did not require the submission of an offeror\u2019s technical \n \n12 We note, at any rate, that even if we were to conclude that the agency\u2019s limited \nfollow- up question constituted discussions, the protester does not explain how the \ndiscussions were misleading or not meaningful.  Specifically, while the protester takes issue with each unfavorable finding noted in the agency\u2019s evaluation of DirectViz\u2019s oral \npresentation, the protester does not explain why the agency was required to raise those findings in discussions when they were not significant enough to prevent the agenc y \nfrom assigning a high confidence rating to DirectViz\u2019s oral presentation.   Page 26 B-423366 et al.  approach for performing the requirement.  Instead, the non- cost\/price portion of offerors\u2019 \nproposals was comprised of prior experience, key personnel resumes, proposed \nbetterments, and oral presentations responding to scenario- based problems.  TOPR \nat 9-18.  With respect to the assessment of cost realism, the solicitation set out the \nfollowing specific methodology:  \n \nThe Government\u2019s objective for cost realism is to utilize Economic Research Institute\u2019s [(ERI)] Salary Assessor tool unburdened hourly rates using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 using Tucson, Arizona locality based on the years of \nexperience proposed for that ERI labor category at the 50th Percentile for each Offeror for direct rate [Most Probable Cost] adjustments for evaluation purposes for the Labor Categories specified in Attachment V GCC Cost WorkBook.  Offerors are c autioned that proposing unburdened \nhourly rates less than the 50th Percentile (ERI Survey Mean Hourly Salary) using NAICS 541519 for Tucson, Arizona may be determined high risk on maintaining the current staff; may have a MPC adjustment performed; and\/or m ay be determined unrealistic and ineligible based on \nGovernment discretion.  \n Id. at 21.   \n As an initial matter, we find no merit to the protester\u2019s argument that the oral presentations constituted the offerors\u2019 unique technical approaches that the agency was required to consider in its cost realism analysis.  In this regard, we note that offerors \nwere required to prepare their oral presentations \u201cbased on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.\u201d  TOPR at  16.  \nAlthough offerors were instructed to \u201cbe prepared to discuss their solutions to the questions and problem statements received,\u201d the solicitation did not require offerors to present their technical approaches for performing the overall requirement.  See id.   \nThus, nothing in the solicitation informed offerors that the content of their oral presentations would be considered their unique technical approach upon which the agency would base any cost -realism adjustments made.   \n Moreover, we note that the protester does not challenge the solicitation\u2019s stated methodology of using ERI labor rates for purposes of the cost realism analysis, nor does the protester point to any error in the agency\u2019s extensive cost realism analysis using those rates.  See generally, AR, Tab  56, Cost Evaluation Report.  Instead, the \nprotester generally avers that \u201c[i]f the Agency performed the required analysis\u201d of considering offerors\u2019 unique technical approaches, \u201cit likely would have adjusted Peraton\u2019s  proposed costs upward or, alternatively, adjusted [DirectViz\u2019s] proposed costs \ndownward, thereby narrowing or eliminating Peraton\u2019s limited 0.3 percent cost advantage.\u201d  Protest at  65.  The protester, however, fails to specifically allege any \nparticular aspect of its own--or the awardee\u2019s --unique technical approach that should \nhave resulted in an adjustment of proposed costs.  See Protest at 64-66; Comments & \n2nd Supp. Protest at  37-39.  Therefore, we dismiss this ground for failure to state a  Page 27 B-423366 et al.  sufficient factual or legal basis of protest.  4  C.F.R. \u00a7  21.5(f) ; see Midwest Tube \nFabricators, Inc.,  B-407166, B -407167, Nov.  20, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 324 at 3 (explaining \nthat our Bid Protest Regulations \u201ccontemplate that protesters will provide, at a minimum, \neither allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action\u201d).    In addition, we find that the solicitation clearly advised offerors of the methodology by which the agency planned to evaluate cost realism in the absence of a technical approach submission.  To the extent the protester argues that the agency\u2019s cost realis m \nanalysis should have included more--such as requiring the submission of technical approach proposals --we find such arguments to be untimely.  Our Bid Protest \nRegulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests and our timeliness rules specifically require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation \nthat are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1); see Quadrant Training Sols. , JV, B-422339, May  7, \n2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6  116 at  7.  Since DirectViz did not challenge these terms before the \ninitial closing date for proposals, any such challenge now would be untimely.   \n CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the agency\u2019s OCI evaluation of Peraton\u2019s proposal was unreasonable.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will only sustain a protest where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving \nthe award.  OGSystems, LLC , B-417026 et al., Jan.  22, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6  66 at  18.  \nHere, in light of the agency\u2019s unreasonable OCI review, we find that DirectViz has established the requisite competitive prejudice as the offeror next in line for award in the event Peraton is disqualified due to an unmitigated OCI.  \n We recommend that the agency, consistent with our decision, meaningfully consider, evaluate, and document its findings about whether Peraton possesses an OCI arising from its performance of the ARCYBER task order.  In the event the agency identifies an OCI, it should either determine what actions would be appropriate to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the identified OCI, or determine that a waiver of the identified OCI would be \nappropriate.  We also recommend that the protester be reimbursed for its costs of filing \nand pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.  4  C.F.R. \u00a7  21.8(d).  The  \nprotester\u2019s certified claims for such costs, detailing the time expended and costs incurred, must be submitted directly to the agency within 60 days after receipt of this decision.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.8(f).  \n The protest is sustained.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

The protester \nchallenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals and award decision, including the agency\u2019s evaluation of Peraton\u2019s organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs).  \n We sustain the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423366 et al.  BACKGROUND  \n \nThe Army issued the solicitation on October 25, 2024, seeking proposals to provide cybersecurity information technology support services for the Army\u2019s GCC.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 7; Agency  Report (AR), \nTab 25, TOPR at 1; AR, Tab 22, Performance Work Statement  (PWS) at 2.\n1  The \nsolicitation was issued, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to firms holding the Army\u2019s Computer Hardware Enterprise and Solutions Information Technology Enterprise Solutions -Services (CHESS- ITESS) multiple -award, \nindefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract.  TOPR at 1, 4.  The solicitation \nanticipated issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee and level -of-effort task order with a 1-\nmonth phase- in period, an 11- month base period of performance, three 1 -year option \nperiods, and one additional 6- month option.  Id.  at 2. \n The task order\u2019s scope of work encompassed \u201coperations and maintenance [] functions, as well as integration of emerging and directed technology adoption\u201d for the Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM), as well as \u201ccommon service support, capability management support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  \nAs relevant here, GCC was previously known as the Regional Cyber Center -Continental \nUnited States (RCC- CONUS), one of five Regional Cyber Cent ers (RCCs) under \nNETCOM.\n2  Protest at 1-2; COS\/MOL at  3-4.  The solicitation advised that \u201c[t] here is a \npossibility that this follow- on requirement for GCC will not exercise all of the options and \nwill merge into a separate competed acquisition for a global, consolidated contract\/task order for support across all [ RCCs ].\u201d  TOPR at 1.  In this regard, the solicitation further \nspecified that \u201cpotential, anticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning [RCC- CONUS] from a[n] RCC to a [GCC] that helps support better \ncoordination of digital oper ations across the world.\u201d  TOPR at  1.  The agency states that \nthe purpose of the task order is to build a new GCC that will \u201cultimately replace and \nsubsume the work of the standalone RCCs.\u201d   COS\/MOL at  3. \n The solicitation advised that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value after a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1) demonstrated prior experience; (2)  key personnel resumes; (3)  oral presentation; \n(4) betterment; and (5) cost\/price.  TOPR at 18-20.  For the tradeoff, all non- cost\/price \nfactors were of relatively equal importance, while the non- cost\/price factors, taken \ntogether, were significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  at 18.  For the evaluation \nof the first three factors, the solicitation provided that the agency would assign \n \n1 The solicitation was amended four times.

The \nsolicitation also informed offerors that proposals rated as either low or some confidence for any of the first three factors would not be considered for award.  Id. at 18. \n The solicitation provided for a two- phased evaluation.  Id.  at 3, 6-18.  Under phase I, \nofferors were to submit proposals for the demonstrated prior experience factor and the key personnel resumes factor.  Id.  at 10-11.  For demonstrated prior experience, \nofferors were required to provide \u201cup to three contracts\/orders\u201d performed within the past seven years to demonstrate experience applicable to the PWS for this requirement, specifically \u201cPWS 3.0 Technical Requ irements through 3.6.1.14.2.\u201d  Id. at 10.  The \nTOPR informed offerors that referenced contracts \u201cshould be the Offeror\u2019s own experience as a prime or subcontractor\u201d and that \u201cexperience from a proposed subcontractor should not be submitted.\u201d  Id.  A detailed narrative was required to \ndescribe  \u201chow the company\u2019s experience for these contracts\/orders in supporting similar \nefforts in size (approximately 300 [full -time equivalents]  supporting 550,000 customers), \ncomplexity, and scope supporting Federal Government organizations is like this requirement .\u201d  Id.  The solicitation advised that the agency would evaluate offerors\u2019 \nsubmissions under the experience factor by assessing the government\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform the requirements.  Id.  at 20. \n For the key personnel factor, the solicitation required offerors to provide resumes for seven key positions identified in the solicitation that \u201cclearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, \ncertifications, and qualifications.\u201d  Id.  at 10-11.  The agency would assess its level of \nconfidence that the offeror had identified and committed key personnel with appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications based on, among other things, the \u201cTable 2 \nExpert -Level Position Requirements and Table 3 Key Technical Personnel \nCertifications\u201d provided in the PWS.  Id. at 20. \n Only those offerors whose phase I proposals were assigned a rating of high confidence for both the experience and key personnel factors would be invited to submit phase II proposals.  Id. at 11.  Under phase II, offerors were to submit their betterment and \ncost\/price proposals, and provide oral presentations.  Id. at 11-18.   \n Under the betterment factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose any \u201cbetterments,\u201d defined as \u201cany instance where the proposed solution exceeds the Government\u2019s requirement in a way that is meaningful for the Government.\u201d  Id. at 16, 20.  Offerors were instructed to \u201cprovide information explaining the promise of the \nbetterment and the betterment\u2019s value to the Government.\u201d  Id.  at 16.  The agency \nwould then evaluate \u201cthe value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate \ncyber space operations across the world and all five of the RCCs.\u201d  Id. at 20. \n  Page 4 B-423366 et al.  For oral presentations, offerors were required to \u201cprovide an oral presentation based on \nthe questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 16.  Offerors were further informed that they should be \u201cprepared to \ndiscuss their solutions . . . for Technical Approach and Staffing\u201d to fulfill the government\u2019s requirement.  Id.  As relevant here, the solicitation also stated that oral \npresentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government.\u201d  Id.  In addition, the \nsolicitation noted that oral presentations were intended to be \u201can interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government\u201d and that these exchanges would be \u201cviewed as a component of the oral presentation itself and do not constitute discussions.\u201d  Id. \nat 17.  The agency would \u201cnot ask questions that will invite or allow the Offeror to \nchange its Proposal\u201d and warned offerors to \u201cnot volunteer any information that might be construed as changing its Proposal.\u201d  Id.  Oral presentations would be evaluated by \nassessing the government\u2019s level of confidence that the offeror would successfully perform all requirements \u201cbased on the answers provided to the questions provided the day of the oral presentation, and any exchanges that occur within the oral presentation.\u201d  Id. at 20.  If an offeror did not receive a rating of high confidence for its oral \npresentation, the offeror would not be considered for award.  Id.  at 18.   \n Seven offerors, including DirectViz and Peraton, submitted phase I proposals.  COS\/MOL at 20.  After completing initial evaluations of the phase I proposals, the \nagency conducted interchanges with all offerors under FAR section 16.505 by issuing evaluation notices and providing an opportunity for offerors to update their phase I \nsubmissions.  Id. at 21; AR, Tab 52, Decision for Interchanges at  1-2.  After evaluating \nthe updated phase I proposals, the agency invited five offerors, including DirectViz and \nPeraton, to proceed to phase II evaluations; all five offerors submitted phase II \nproposals and participated in oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  23; AR, Tab 65, Task \nOrder Decision Document (TODD) at  13.   \n As relevant here, the agency decided not to record the oral presentations, but each member of the technical proposal evaluation board (PEB) took contemporaneous notes.  COS\/MOL at 23; see AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Evaluators\u2019 Oral Presentation Notes.  \nFollowing the oral presentations, the PEB members conducted a panel discussion to establish consensus ratings for the offerors\u2019 oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  23; AR, \nTab 64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation Report at  1.   \n Following the evaluation of phase II proposal submissions, the proposals of DirectViz and Peraton were assigned the following final ratings:  \n \n DirectViz  Peraton  \nDemonstrated Prior Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nKey Personnel Resumes  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nOral Presentation  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nBetterment s 1 1 \nTotal Evaluated Cost\/Price  $225,833,063  $225,089,343  \n AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.    Page 5 B-423366 et al.   \nThe contracting officer, who was also the source selection authority (SSA), reviewed the PEB\u2019s technical evaluation reports and concurred with its findings.  Id.  at 1, 12.  The \nSSA then conducted a tradeoff analysis of offerors\u2019 proposals under each technical factor and selected Peraton\u2019s proposal for award, finding that DirectViz\u2019s proposal was \u201cnot sufficiently more advantageous to the Government to warrant payi ng\u201d the price \npremium of $743,719.  Id.  at 39-40.  The SSA noted that, while the two offerors w ere \nassigned the same ratings of high confidence under each of the first three non-cost\/price factors, with one betterment each, Peraton\u2019s proposal provided a better \nvalue.  Id.  at 40.  Specifically, the SSA found that Peraton demonstrated prior \nexperience on contracts with \u201ca larger size, complexity, and scope\u201d and its proposed betterment of automated workflows increased the agency\u2019s confidence that Peraton would provide \u201cexcept ional value\u201d for transitioning the RCC for the continental United \nStates into a GCC.  Id.  Based on these findings, the Army selected Peraton for \nissuance of the task order.  Id. \n The Army provided a debriefing to DirectViz, and this protest followed.\n3   \n DISCUSSION  DirectViz raises numerous challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision.  First, the protester contends that Peraton is precluded from award because of unmitigated OCIs.  The protester also asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposal s under each evaluation factor and failed to sufficiently document offerors\u2019 oral \npresentations.  Finally, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff \ndecision was flawed.   \nAs detailed below, we find that the agency\u2019s OCI analysis of Peraton was unreasonable \nand sustain the protest on that basis.  We have also considered all of the remaining \nissues raised by DirectViz and, while we do not discuss every argument, we find no additional basis on which to sustain the protest.\n4    \n Organizational Conflict of Interest  \n DirectViz contends that the agency failed to meaningfully consider and sufficiently investigate unmitigated OCIs arising from Peraton\u2019s performance under a separate task \n \n3 The awarded value of the task order at issue exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this \nprotest is within our Office\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve protests in connection with the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under the \nauthority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n4 In addition, we do not discuss here the protester\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s \nbest-value tradeoff analysis, which are rendered academic in light of our decision \nsustaining the challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s OCI.   Page 6 B-423366 et al.  order supporting the Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER).5  Protest at  26-32; Comments \n& 2nd Supp. Protest at  46-73.  The protester argues that Peraton improperly failed to \ndisclose these conflicts, and that the agency failed to reasonably investigate them.  Id.  \nAs discussed below, based on our review of the record, we find that the agency failed to \nadequately consider an impaired objectivity OCI arising from Peraton\u2019s work under the ARCYBER task order.  \n The FAR requires contracting officials to identify and evaluate organization conflicts of interests as early as possible, and to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts so as to prevent an unfair competitive advantage or the existenc e of conflicting \nroles that might impair a contractor\u2019s objectivity.  FAR 9.504(a), 9.505.  The identification of conflicts of interest is a fact -specific inquiry that requires the exercise of \nconsiderable discretion.  MANDEX, Inc., B -421664 et al., Aug.  16, 2023, 2023 CPD \n\u00b6 201 at  5.  To successfully allege a conflict of interest, a protester must identify hard \nfacts that indicate the existence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough.  AAR Mfg. Inc., d\/b\/a AAR Mobility Sys ., B-418339, Mar.  17, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  106 at  5.  Our Office reviews OCI \ninvestigations for reasonableness, and where an agency has given meaningful consideration to whether a significant conflict of interest exists, we will not substitute our judgment for  the agency\u2019s absent clear evidence that the agency\u2019s conclusion is \nunreasonable.  Inquiries, Inc.,  B-417415.2, Dec.  30, 2019, 2020 CPD \u00b6  54 at  6. \n  Additional Background \n As noted above, the awardee will be required to provide cybersecurity information \ntechnology support services for the GCC.  The scope of the work, as described in the \nPWS, encompasses \u201coperation and maintenance [] functions, as well as [the] integration of emerging and directed technology adoption, . . . common service support, capability \nmanagement support, enterprise services support, operational support, secure operations support, and sustainment services support.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.  The \nwide range of technical support envisioned also includes capability management support for NETCOM and enterprise services division to provide secure operations for the enterprise network infrastructure.  Id. at 3-9.   \n On December 7, 2023, Peraton was awarded a separate Army task order, under the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated \n \n5 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to consider OCIs arising from \nPeraton\u2019s performance on the predecessor task order to the current ARCYBER task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at 73 74.  After reviewing the supplemental agency report,  the protester withdrew its allegation of an impaired objectivity OCI based \non this predecessor task order but maintained that Peraton had biased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  Supp. Comments at 38 n.9.  For the same reasons discussed herein with respect to the allegations of biased ground rules and unequal access OCIs arising from the ARCYBER task order, we find no merit to these OCI assertions arising from the predecessor task order.

The expansive requirements under the \nARCYBER task order include the provision of:  overarching program management support; intelligence support; cyberspace operations support; planning, strategy, policy, and doctrine support; DODIN mi ssion support; readiness, training, and exercises \nsupport; and communication and collaboration support.

Peraton also \n\u201cprovide[s] cyberspace operations support,\u201d not only \u201cfor ARCYBER Headquarters,\u201d but also for \u201cARCYBER subordinate components, service component partners of USCYBERCOM, and other cyber mission partners.\u201d  Id. at 8.   \n In explaining the relevant command relationship between ARCYBER and GCC, the GCC task order PWS explains that ARCYBER is the \u201cprimary Army headquarters responsible for cyberspace operations in support of Army and Joint requirements\u201d and that it serves as t he single point of contact \u201cfor reporting and assessing Army \ncyberspace incidents, events, and operations in Army networks, and for synchronizing and integrating Army responses thereto.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  2.

Id.  GCC is part of t he 7th Signal Command.  Id.  The GCC PWS further explains \nthat \u201cARCYBER plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes, directs, and conducts an integrated defense within all Army networks, and as directed, within the DODIN.\u201d  Id.   \n As relevant here, the solicitation required offerors to \u201cdisclose complete information of any work performed by their company that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition or which could result in a potential [OCI].\u201d  TOPR at  9.  An OCI \nmitigation plan was only required if the firm identified an actual or potential OCI.  Id.  \nPeraton\u2019s proposal stated that it was \u201cnot currently aware of any facts which create any actual or potential [OCI] relating to this opportunity\u201d and thus did not prov ide any OCI \nmitigation plan.  AR, Tab 38, Peraton Proposal General Vol. at  5.   \n Based on DirectViz\u2019s allegations in its initial and second supplemental protests, the contracting officer conducted two rounds of  investigations into potential OCIs arising \nfrom Peraton\u2019s performance of the ARCYBER task order.   COS\/MOL at 27; see \ngenerally, AR, Tab  71, OCI Determination.   After reviewing relevant documents --\nincluding the PWS of each task order, declarations from the technical lead for the GCC task order and the acquisition chief for the ARCYBER task order, and Peraton\u2019s responses to OCI questionnaires --the contracting officer concluded that no OCIs \nexisted.  AR, Tab 71, OCI Determination at  2.  DirectViz disputes this conclusion and \nargues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton\u2019s potential OCIs.  Comments & 2nd Supp.  Protest at 44- 73; Supp. Comments at  48-53.  Page 8 B-423366 et al.    \nImpaired Objectivity OCI  \n The protester argues that Peraton has an unmitigated impaired objectivity OCI.\n6  Our \nOffice has explained that an impaired objectivity OCI arises where a firm\u2019s ability to \nrender impartial advice to the government would be undermined by the firm\u2019s competing interests.  FAR 9.505(a); AT&T Corp ., B-417107.4, July  2, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  283 at  6.  \nHere, the protester asserts that an OCI arises from the broad cyber support that Peraton provides to ARCYBER, including support for the GCC, one of ARCYBER\u2019s subordinate components.  Protest at  26-30.  In this regard, the protester points to \nspecific provisions in the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton to assist ARCYBER with \n \n6 The protester also alleges that Peraton\u2019s work on the ARCYBER task order also raises \nbiased ground rules and unequal access to information OCIs.  A  biased ground rules \nOCI arises where a firm, as part of its performance of a government contract, has in some sense set the ground rules for the competition for another government contract .  \nFAR 9.505- 1, 9.505- 2.  In these cases, the primary concern is that the firm could skew \nthe competition, whether intentionally or not, in favor of itself.   Systems Made Simple, \nInc., B-412948.2, July  20, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 207 at 6.  DirectViz, however, does not \nprovide any support for its argument that Peraton actually participated in any activity that could have shaped or skewed the requirements for the GCC task order in its favor.  The protester\u2019s inference based on the portions of the ARCYBER PWS that require Peraton\u2019s support to develop agency -wide cyber policy and strategy, without more, does \nnot constitute the hard facts  required to evidenc e Peraton\u2019s participation in activities \ngiving rise to a biased ground rules OCI .  See Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, \nSept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  332 at  8 (protester s must identify hard facts that show the \nexistence or potential existence of a conflict; mere inference or suspicion of an actual or potential conflict is not enough).  \nWe likewise find no basis to sustain the protester\u2019s allegation of an unequal access to information OCI.  An unequal access to information OCI exists where a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract, and where that information may provide the firm an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract.  FAR 9.505(b), 9.505- 4; Cyberdata Techs., Inc. , \nB-411070 et al., May  1, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6  150 at  6.  Other than general conjecture \nabout overarching policy and strategic information that Peraton could have encountered \nat planning meetings, DirectViz does not describe any specific information that reasonably constitutes non- public information that could have provided Peraton with a \ncompetitive advantage.  Moreover, with respect to high- level knowledge of the agency\u2019s \ngeneral priorities, the protester has not shown that such information is beyond the unique information, advantages, and capabilities  that a vendor may possess  due to its \nprior experience under a government contract .  The government is not necessarily \nrequired to equalize competition to compensate for such normally occurring \nadvantages , unless there is evidence of preferential treatment or other improper action.  \nSee Bland & Assocs., PC, B -419924, Sept.  28, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  332 at  6; CACI, Inc. -\nFed.,  B-403064.2, Jan.  28, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6  31 at  10.    Page 9 B-423366 et al.  shaping overarching cyber policies and plans for its subordinate components, which \ninclude GCC, creating opportunities for Peraton to influence decisions at the ARCYBER level to benefit Peraton\u2019s work at the GCC.  Id.   The protester also asserts that \nPeraton\u2019s role under the ARCYBER task order allows Peraton to provide biased advice to ARCYBER about deliverables Peraton would provide under the GCC task order.  Id.     \n Based on our review of the record, we agree with the protester that a significant potential conflict  of interest arises from Peraton\u2019s competing roles  under the ARCYBER \nand GCC task orders, which might impair Peraton\u2019s  objectivity  in the performance of its \nobligations under the two task orders.  In this regard, we find that the contracting officer\u2019s conclusions that Peraton is \u201cnot authorized to structure policies for the GCC Government personnel on the ARCYBER Task Order\u201d and \u201cdoes not provide guidance\/advice on how the GCC Task Order [contractor] handles its cyber operations,\u201d  \nsee AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11, are not supported by the record, \nspecifically the express terms of the PWS for the respective task orders.    \n For example, the cyberspace operational support task of the ARCYBER task order explains that ARCYBER cyberspace operations \u201cmaintain[] Operational Control [] over the RCCs\u201d\n7 and \u201cmonitor[] and ingest[] information throughout the RCCs and facilitate[] \ninformation flow directly to the ARCYBER Commander.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  33.  Under this task, however, Peraton as the ARCYBER contractor must \n\u201cassist in cyberspa ce operations planning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing, and \nconducting cyberspace operations and defense of the Army networks,\u201d as well as \u201cdevelop and maintain [standard operating procedures (SOP)] and [tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)]  pertinent to all cyberspace operations services.\u201d  Id.  Peraton \nmust also \u201c[r]eview, assess, and recommend courses of action in response to confirmed, potential threat activity, and unknown\/new vulnerabilities.\u201d  Id.  at 35.   \n At the same time, under the GCC task order, Peraton would support \u201cservices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational support services for both the GCC and the Warfighter.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  28.  Within this task, Peraton would be \nrequir ed to \u201cperform cybersecurity services to secure DODIN -[Army] information \nsystems and networks\u201d as dictated by applicable DOD and Army security policies and procedures, as well as \u201cestablish vulnerability management process to identify, classify, prioritize , remediate and\/or mitigate, verify, and document existing vulnerabilities to the \nnetwork and information systems.\u201d  Id.   \n These overlapping responsibilities set up an inherent conflict of interest and provide an incentive for Peraton to provide biased advice to the government.  For instance, while Peraton assists ARCYBER to develop SOPs and TTPs that would govern cyberspace \noperations at the GCC, Peraton has an incentive to align these policies and procedures \nwith its own capabilities to perform cybersecurity services under the GCC task order.  Moreover, even as Peraton establishes a vulnerability management process for DODIN \n \n7 As explained above, GCC is considered one of the RCCs for the purpose of the \ncommand relationship with respect to ARCYBER.   Page 10 B-423366 et al.  under the GCC task order, it would be in position to \u201c[r]eview, assess, and recommend \ncourses of action in response to . . . vulnerabilities\u201d under the ARCYBER task order, where Peraton would have the opportunity and incentive to favorably assess the vulnerability management process at GCC.  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35. \n As another example, Peraton is required to \u201cassist in planning, coordinating, and synchronizing DODIN operations\u201d under the ARCYBER task order, which includes the responsibility not only to \u201carchitect, build, configure, secure, operate, maintain, and susta in networks and information,\u201d but also to \u201csupport mission assurance efforts, to \ninclude the assessment and implementation of cybersecurity policies [and] programs.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  40.  As part of this effort, Peraton must \n\u201c[c]onduct network and infrastructure plans and assessments  for the adoption and \nimplementation of enterprise services, such as cybersecurity\u201d and \u201c[p]rovide weekly updates\u201d on the \u201cstatus of the implementation plans.\u201d  Id.   \n Under the GCC task order, however, Peraton is responsible for \u201csecur[ing], operat[ing], and maintain[ing]\u201d DODIN\u2019s internet protocol networks in accordance with ARCYBER -\ndeveloped policies and programs, and for providing \u201cOperational Oversight\u201d for the \u201c[c]oordination, partnering, and reporting through other DODIN -[Army] service \nproviders,\u201d including ARCYBER.  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  4, 17.  Thus, as Peraton carries \nout its duty under the ARCYBER task order to assess and implement cybersecurity policies for DODIN operations, it is in a position to favorably assess and report on \nGCC\u2019s implementation of cybersecurity plans, which have been performed by Peraton under the GCC task order.   \n \nA similar conflict arises from Peraton\u2019s duties under the information assurance task of the ARCYBER task order, which include \u201creal -time management and surveillance of the \nArmy\u2019s portion of the DODIN,\u201d and require Peraton to \u201c[c]oordinate with . . . RCCs .  . . \non outages and matters that require escalation to resolve technical deficiencies.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  35.  Mirroring this requirement, the GCC task order \nrequires the awardee to provide \u201c24\/7 operational oversight, support, and maintenance of all GCC- managed services residing on the Army\u2019s . . . portion of the DODIN -[Army],\u201d \nincluding the responsibility to \u201ctrack and report incidents\/outages as outlined in the established SOPs, policy, and guidance.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, PWS at  16.  The GCC contractor \nis also required to \u201cdevelop [after action reports] to document the entirety of the issue, response, and remediation from a holistic perspective across the DODIN which is inclusive of all relevant Service Providers (e.g., . . . ARCYBER . . .).\u201d  Id.  Under these \ninterrelated tasks, it is seemingly possible for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to be put in the position of determining and reporting on whether an outage incident at the GCC --as managed by Peraton as the GCC contractor --requires \n\u201cescalation to resolve technical deficiencies.\u201d  AR, Tab 71u, ARCYBER Task Order \nat 35.  In such a scenario, Peraton would have both the incentive and the opportunity to \nskew its ARCYBER report to put its work under the GCC task order in the most  \nfavorable light rather than objectively assessing the effectiveness of its own work.  \n  Page 11 B-423366 et al.  The above examples illustrate just a few instances where the interplay between the \nARCYBER task order and the GCC task order could potentially create an impaired objectivity OCI for a contractor performing on both task orders.  In this regard, our Office has sustained allegations of impaired objectivity OCI where the terms of a previously \nawarded contract or task order would require a contractor to advise the agency on work in which it has a competing interest because of its role in the protested award.  Se e \nMANDEX, Inc., supra at 11-12.   \n In MANDEX, we found that the agency\u2019s determination (that there was no impaired \nobjectivity OCI) was unreasonable where the contracting officer failed to consider the full scope of PWS provisions requiring the awardee, performing under a previously awarded task order, to provide input about its work and performance under the protested award.  See id.  In Inquiries, Inc., we sustained an allegation of an impaired \nobjectivity OCI where the role of the awardee\u2019s subcontractor under the protested contract would affect its ability to provide unbiased services under a project \nmanagement task order previously awarded to the subcontractor.  See Inquiries, Inc., \nsupra at 8-9.  Similarly, here, we find that the plain terms of the two task orders\u2019 \nperformance requirements raise a significant potential impaired objectivity OCI, where Peraton\u2019s ability to provide unbiased advice under the ARCYBER task order is impaired by its competing interest as the contractor performing the GCC task order.  \n  Inadequate OCI Investigation  \n The protester also argues that the agency failed to meaningfully investigate Peraton\u2019s OCI because the contracting officer did not examine the work Peraton performs under \nthe ARCYBER task order in relation to the work it would perform under the GCC task order.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  44-46, 62- 70.  Based on our review of the \nrecord before us, we agree.   \n Despite the contracting officer\u2019s conclusion that no OCI arises from Peraton\u2019s roles under the two task orders, neither of the two OCI determinations show any analysis with respect to the work required to be performed under the PWSs of the respective task orders.  In this regard, although the contracting officer conducted two rounds of OCI investigations based on the protest allegations, neither OCI determination addresses any of the specific sections of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC PWS that the protester cites as potentially giving rise to an impaired objectivity OCI.  See generally,  \nAR, Tab  71, OCI Determination; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination.  Instead, the \ncontracting officer\u2019s analysis of an impaired objectivity OCI relies entirely on:  (1) conclusory declarations of the contracting officer representative (COR) for the GCC \ntask order and an acquisition official for ARCYBER; (2) self -serving statements from \nPeraton that patently conflict with the plain terms of the PWSs; and (3)  the role of \ngovernment officials providing final sign- off on contractor work products.  See AR, \nTab 71, OCI Determination at  9-10; AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  11-14.  As \nfurther discussed below, we find the contracting officer\u2019s reliance on these aspects of its investigation without an independent analysis of the respective PWSs to be unreasonable.   Page 12 B-423366 et al.   \nFirst, the record shows that the declarations provided by the GCC task order COR and the ARCYBER acquisition official were entirely conclusory and, like the contracting officer\u2019s OCI determinations, lacked any analysis of the specific PWS provisions, including those painstakingly enumerated by the protester.  See AR, Tab 71w, Decl. of \nGCC COR at  1-2; AR, Tab 71x, Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-2; AR, Tab  81, 2nd \nDecl. of GCC COR at 1 -3; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  1-4.  For \nexample, both the GCC COR and the ARCYBER Official conclude, without any documented analysis of specific PWS sections, that \u201cARCYBER does not provide guidance or advice on how the GCC handles its cyber operations . . . . [and] ARCYBER does not dictate how the GCC execute any part of its mission.\u201d  AR, Tab 81, 2nd Decl. \nof GCC COR at 2; AR, Tab  82, 2nd Decl. of ARCYBER Official at  2.  The contracting \nofficer, in his OCI determinations, adopts these conclusory statements without any additional analysis of the work required t o be performed by Peraton under the two task \norders.  However, as discussed above, the declarants\u2019 conclusory remarks are belied by the ARCYBER PWS provisions requiring Peraton to assist ARCYBER in developing policies and strategies governing the cyber operations at the GCC level, as well as the GCC PWS requiring the GCC contractor to take operational direction from ARCYBER.  Thus, we find unreasonable the contracting officer\u2019s wholesale adoption of these declarants\u2019 conclusory statements without independently analyzing the work required under the two task orders.  \n Second, we also find unreasonable the contracting officer\u2019s reliance on Peraton\u2019s responses to OCI questions where the responses plainly conflicted with the terms of the respective PWS.  In this regard, in responding \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking whether \nPeraton \u201cthrough the ARCYBER task order provide[s] advice about GCC cyber \noperations,\u201d Peraton provided a list of areas where it only provides technical support for \u201can inherent Governmental function and responsibility performed only by Government personnel.\u201d   Tab 71y, Peraton Responses to OCI Questions at  3-4.  The plain terms of \nthe ARCYBER task order, however, list those same tasks as part of the contractor\u2019s responsibility.  For example, Peraton states that \u201c Government personnel  in ARCYBER \nHQs are responsible for providing intelligence support to the RCCs\/GCC and for conducting all -source analysis and production support for full spectrum cyberspace \noperations and planning.\u201d  Id. at 4 (emphasis added).  The ARCYBER PWS, however, \nprovides that \u201c[t]he contractor  shall provide all -source intelligence support for the RCCs\u201d \nand \u201c[c]onduct all -source analysis and production support to full spectrum cyberspace \noperations and planning at the RCCs .\u201d  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order at  25 \n(emphasis added).  The contracting officer\u2019s OCI determination relies on the awardee\u2019s \nself-serving responses without meaningfully considering the actual PWS provisions that \ngave rise to the OCI concerns  and, in so doing, fails to note the inconsistenc ies \nbetween Peraton\u2019s statements a nd the clearly stated PWS requirements under the \nARCYBER task order .  See AR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-14.   \n Third, in light of the contracting officer\u2019s failure to recognize any potential OCI from Peraton\u2019s competing roles under the two task orders --as well as Peraton\u2019s statement \nthat it has no OCIs to disclose or mitigate, see AR, Tab  38, Peraton Proposal General  Page 13 B-423366 et al.  Vol. at  5--we find that the OCI concerns here are not mitigated by the contracting \nofficer\u2019s general reliance on the role of agency officials.  In this regard, the contracting \nofficer explains that \u201cany input received [by GCC] from ARCYBER would be from Government personnel only\u201d and that \u201ceven if Peraton did provide support for [the GCC] \ntask order, any product that GCC sends to ARCYBER has to be coordinated and approved\u201d by government officials.  AR, Tab 85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12.  The \ncontracting officer further concludes that, because \u201cPeraton\u2019s advice to GCC would be limited to technical, objective advice reviewed by Government personnel,\u201d it \u201ccould not give rise to an opportunity for Peraton to shade that advice to benefit its other contract team .\u201d  Id. at 13.   \n Our Office has explained, however, that the fact that agency officials must approve any recommendations from the contractor does not inherently mitigate the risk that the advice received from the contractor could be biased.  See Inquiries, Inc., supra at  10 \n(\u201cWe conclude that the contracting officer\u2019s blanket reliance on the requirement that changes must be approved by government personnel does not reasonably show that the contracting officer gave meaningful consideration to the risk of impaired objectivity  \nOCIs.\u201d).  As noted, the purpose of an OCI review is to determine whether a firm\u2019s advice to the government would be impaired by conflicting duties or interests.  AT&T Corp ., \nsupra.   Here, as discussed above, the expansive contractor  responsibilities under the \nARCYBER task order require Peraton to \u201c[p]rovide assistance in the development, inspection, evaluation, and oversight of cybersecurity policies and procedures\u201d for the ARCYBER headquarters and its subordinate components that specifically include the GCC.  AR, Tab  71u, ARCYBER Task Order  at 41.  We conclude that the final approval \nof government personnel for these policies and procedures before they are deployed to \nGCC does not resolve the risk that Peraton\u2019s ability to provide objective advice on such policies and procedures might be impaired by its interest in benefiting Peraton\u2019s work under the GCC task order.  \n Finally, to the extent the contracting officer relied on the fact that the two task orders are administered by two different acquisition offices or the statement that Peraton would not be involved in evaluating contractor performance, we find such reliance to be \nmisplaced.  In this regard, the contracting officer concluded that there is no opportunity for Peraton, performing under the ARCYBER task order, to direct its work under the GCC task order because the ARCYBER task order was issued under GSA\u2019s OASIS IDIQ contract, which was managed by a contracting office separate from the one managing the GCC task order issued under the Army\u2019s CHESS -ITESS IDIQ contract.  \nAR, Tab  85, 2nd OCI Determination at  12-13.  The contracting officer further concluded  \nthat Peraton would not be evaluating its own work because the evaluation of contractor performance in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System  (CPARS) \nwill be completed by government personnel without any contractor input or access .  Id. \nat 13-14.   \nIn light of the circumstances here, we find that both of these lines of inquiry are irrelevant  to determining whether there is an impaired objectivity OCI.  Again, the \npurpose of an impaired objectivity OCI review is to determine whether the firm\u2019s advice to the government  in the performance of the requirements would be impaired by  Page 14 B-423366 et al.  conflicting duties or interests.  Here, the fact that the two task orders were issued under \ndifferent contract vehicles or are administered by different contracting offices has no bearing on whether the ability of the same contractor to render objective services under one task order may be impaired by its competing interest in performing the other task order.  Likewise, when questioning whether the contractor would be evaluating its own work, the concern is not with the evaluation of contractor performance in CPARS, but on whether the contractor, during the performance of its duties under one contract, would be tasked with evaluating or assessing its own product or services provided under a different contract.   \n In sum, we find that the contracting officer unreasonably failed to meaningfully consider whether the work Peraton is required to perform under the terms of the respective PWSs of the ARCYBER task order and the GCC task order would impair Peraton\u2019s ability  to provide objective and unbiased services to the agency.  As discussed above, \nthe plain terms of the respective PWSs include several overlapping responsibilities with significant potential for an impaired objectivity OCI in Peraton\u2019s performance of both task orders, yet the contracting officer\u2019s OCI investigation did not address any of these PWS provisions.  In light of this missing analysis, we have no basis to conclude that the OCI determination was reasonable or sufficient .  We therefore sustain the protest on \nthis basis.  \n Demonstrated Prior Experience  \n The protester argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals under the demonstrated prior experience factor.  Specifically, the protester contends that the \nagency failed to give sufficient credit for DirectViz\u2019s highly relevant experience under the incumbent task order.  The protester also asserts that the agency improperly credited the awardee\u2019s proposal for the experience of its subsidiary entities.  Based on our review of the record, we find no merit to these arguments.  \n The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a matter within the contracting agency\u2019s discretion because the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them.  Verizon Bus. Network  Servs., Inc., \nB-419271.5 et al., Apr. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  191 at  7.  In reviewing protests of an \naward in a task order competition, we do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria and applicable \nprocurement laws and regulations.  Technatomy Corp.,  B-411583, Sept.  4, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 282 at 4- 5.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation \njudgment, without more, is not sufficient to establish that an agency acted unreasonably.  Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., supra.  \n  Protester\u2019s Incumbent Experience  \n The protester first asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to identify additional distinguishing benefits for DirectViz\u2019s demonstrated prior experience as the contractor  Page 15 B-423366 et al.  currently performing the incumbent effort under the predecessor task order.  Protest \nat 33-40.  In this regard, the protester argues that aspects of its highly similar work \nperformed on the incumbent effort deserved more recognition in the agency\u2019s evaluat ion \nand best -value tradeoff.  Id.; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  15-16.   \n The agency responds that it evaluated the protester\u2019s experience submission reasonably and in accordance with the solicitation.  Specifically, the agency contends that the protester received the highest possible rating based on its incumbent experience and was not entitled to receive any additional credit.  COS\/MOL at  48-50.   \n The record shows that the protester submitted one experience reference in its proposal, describing its incumbent effort on the predecessor task order supporting the Army\u2019s RCC- CONUS.  AR, Tab  27, DirectViz Experience Proposal at  7.  In assigning the \nhighes t rating possible, high confidence, the agency noted that DirectViz\u2019s experience \n\u201cdemonstrated that it is familiar with the Global Cyber Center [] mission.\u201d  AR, Tab 60, \nDirectViz Experience Evaluation at  1.  The agency also found that DirectViz \n\u201cdemonstra ted experience on a contract of similar size and scope with the services \nidentified in [PWS] para[graphs] 3.0 to 3.6.1.14.2.\u201d  Id.  In the comparative analysis of \nDirectViz and Peraton\u2019s proposals, however, the SSA noted that while both offerors received the rating of high confidence under the demonstrated prior experience factor, Peraton\u2019s experience under a contract with the Navy\u2019s  Next Generation Enterprise \nNetwork (NGEN) had \u201ca larger size, complexity, and scope than\u201d the instant requirement.  AR, Tab 65, TODD at  39. \n On this record, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s \nincumbent experience.  First, our Office has explained that there is no requirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent offeror.  Candor Sols., LLC , \nB-417950.5, B -417950.6, May  10, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  199 at  15.  An offeror\u2019s belief that \nits incumbency status entitles it to higher ratings or additional assessed strengths does not provide a basis for finding that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  See id.  \n In addition, the agency explains that the scope of work under the instant solicitation was anticipated to include work beyond the scope of the incumbent task order.  COS\/MOL at 3-5, 48- 49.  In this regard, the solicitation specified that \u201c[a] dditional potential, \nanticipated mission changes over the life of the contract include transitioning from a \nRCC to a [GCC] that helps support better coordination of digital operations across the \nworld .\u201d  TOPR at  1; see also id. at 16, 20 (requiring proposed betterments to exceed \nrequirements in a way that is meaningful for the agency \u201cfor transitioning from [a RCC] to a [GCC] that coordinates better digital operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.\u201d).  Based on this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s conclusion that the protester\u2019s incumbent experience did not warrant any extra recognition beyond the assigned rating of high confidence.  \n  Awardee\u2019s Affiliate Experience  \n  Page 16 B-423366 et al.  The protester also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s demonstrated \nprior experience, alleging that the agency improperly credited Peraton for the experience of the firm\u2019s affiliate entities.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  6-15.  The \nrecord shows that Perat on submitted two experience references, both performed by its \nwholly owned subsidiary entities --Peraton Technology Services, Inc. and Peraton \nEnterprise Solutions, LLC.  AR, Tab 39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  The \nprotester argues that Peraton\u2019s proposal did not warrant this credit because it did not clearly show these affiliates\u2019 involvement in the performance of the task order.  Id.   The \nagency responds that the solicitation did not prohibit the submission of affiliate experience as an offeror\u2019s own experience and that Peraton\u2019s proposal sufficiently described the commitment of its affiliate resources for performing the instant requi rement.  Supp. COS\/MOL at  7-30.  Based on our review of the record, we agree \nwith the agency.  \n An agency properly may attribute the experience or past performance of a parent or affiliated company to an offeror where the firm\u2019s proposal demonstrates that the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  Alutiiq Pac., \nLLC, B-409584, B -409584.2, June 18, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6  196 at  4.  The relevant \nconsideration is whether the resources of the parent or affiliated company --its workforce, \nmanagement, facilities or other resources --will be provided or relied upon for contr act \nperformance such that the parent or affiliate will have meaningful involvement in contract performance.  Peraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023  CPD \u00b6 92.  \n Here, the awardee\u2019s proposal reflects the meaningful involvement of its affiliate entities.  Specifically, Peraton\u2019s demonstrated experience volume explained that Peraton \n\u201cmanages its combined business, including all subsidiaries , with a centralized \nleadership structure, consolidated business systems, and common practices, personnel, and other resources to effectively serve multiple government customers worldwide.\u201d  AR, Tab  39, Peraton Experience Proposal at  5.  Moreover, the proposal expressly \nstated as follows:  \n \n. . . the personnel, resources, and qualifications offered and committed in this proposal, including those in the corporate experience and past performance citations relied on herein--specifically, ARCYBER [Cyberspace Operations Support] Contract, held by Peraton subsidiary Peraton Technology Services Inc., and NGEN Contract, held by Peraton \nsubsidiary Peraton Enterprise Solutions LLC, under its former name, \nPerspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC --are fully available and attributable to \nPeraton for the successf ul performance of the requirements of this \nsolicitation.  \n  Page 17 B-423366 et al.  Id.8  On this record, we find that the agency reasonably relied on the stated \nperformance commitment of Peraton\u2019s affiliate resources to attribute the experience of \nthose affiliated companies to the awardee.    The protester argues that the agency\u2019s arguments in this regard should be disregarded as impermissible post hoc rationalizations because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not include any discussion of Peraton\u2019s affiliate entities.  Supp. Comments at  13-19.  To support its post -protest explanations, the agency submitted a \ndeclaration from the technical chai r of the PEB stating that the evaluators \u201creviewed the \ninformation submitted regarding Peraton\u2019s corporate acquisitions and structure,\u201d and \u201cconcluded that Peraton had demonstrated sufficient integration and reliance on the \naffiliates\u2019 resources to treat their experience as the offeror\u2019s own.\u201d  AR, Tab  83, \nTechnical Chair Decl. at  2-3. \n Our Office has explained that, in reviewing an agency\u2019s evaluation, we will not limit our review to contemporaneously documented evidence, but instead will consider all the information provided, including a party\u2019s arguments and explanations.  American Sys. Corp ., B-420132 et al., Dec. 13, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  387 at  10.  Although we generally \ngive little or no weight to reevaluations and judgments prepared in the heat of the adversarial process, post -protest explanations that provide a detailed rationale for \ncontemporaneous conclusions, and simply fill in previously unrecorded details, will generally be considered in our review, as long as those explanations are credible and  \nconsistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id.  Here, we find the agency\u2019s post -\nprotest explanation to be credible and consistent with the contemporaneous evaluation \nrecord, which does not include any reason to call into question the commitment of these \naffiliate resources in the performance of the t ask order.\n9 \n \n \n8 Since the solicitation did not require a technical approach proposal, Peraton\u2019s \ncommitment of its subsidiary resources was provided as part of the demonstrated \nexperience volume of its proposal.  \n9 DirectViz also contends that it was improper for the agency to consider one of \nPeraton\u2019s two experience references because it was for work performed under an IDIQ contract rather than an individual task order under that contract.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  12-15.  As the agency points out, however, the solicitation required \nofferors to submit \u201cup to three contracts\/orders\u201d performed within the past seven years to demonstrate their prior experience and to describe how the firm\u2019s \u201cexperience for these contracts\/orders in supporting similar efforts\u201d is like the instant requirement.  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 25; see TOPR at  10.  The language of the solicitation, therefore, \npermitted offerors to submit references by describing work performed at the IDIQ contract level.  Accordingly, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s consideration of Peraton\u2019s experience under an IDIQ contract.   Page 18 B-423366 et al.  Key Personnel Resumes  \n \nThe protester next argues that the agency erroneously assigned a rating of high confidence to the awardee\u2019s proposal under the key personnel resumes factor when Peraton\u2019s proposed virtualization\/cloud computing senior subject matter expert (SME) did not meet the minimum certification requirement.  Protest at  45-47; Comments & 2nd \nSupp. Protest at  16-20.  Specifically, the protester asserts that the solicitation required a \n\u201cVMware Certified Advanced Professional\u201d for this position, but Peraton\u2019s proposed key  \nperson was only a \u201cVMware Certified Professional.\u201d  Id.  The agency responds that the \nprotester mistakenly refers to the requirement for a different position.  In this regard, the Army asserts that the solicitation only required a \u201cVMware Certified Professional\u201d certification (without the \u201cadvanced\u201d designation)  for the  proposed virtualization\/cloud \ncomputing senior SME.  COS\/MOL at  52-54.   \n The solicitation here required offerors to submit resumes for seven key positions, including a \u201c Virtualization\/Cloud Computing Senior [SME] .\u201d  TOPR at  10.  The solicitation \nadvised that submitted resumes \u201cshall clearly demonstrate how each of the proposed Key Personnel meets the requirements for appropriate experience, certifications, and qualifications\u201d based on two PWS -provided tables: table 2, expert -level positions \nrequirements, and table 3, key technical personnel certifications.  Id.  at 10-11.  The \nvirtualization\/cloud computing senior SME position only appears on table 3.  AR, Tab 22, \nPWS at  52.  As listed in table 3, the position required a \u201cVMware Certified Professional\u201d \ncertification, as well as a number of cloud- related certifications.  Id .   \n On the other hand, table 2, which described \u201csome functional areas [that] require expert \nlevel expertise,\u201d included the position of a \u201cVirtualization Infrastructure Senior [SME]\u201d among the 16 functional areas\/positions.  Id.  at 50-51.  Table 2 specified that the \nvisualization infrastructure senior SME be a \u201cVMware Certified Advanced Professional.\u201d  \nId. at 51 (emphasis added).  Although the protester argues that the virtualization \ninfrastructure  senior SME in table 2 and the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME \nin table 3 are one and the same key position, the plain reading of the solicitation language does not support this interpretation.  \n Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s actual requirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.  Karthik Consulting, LLC, B -421610.2, May  31, \n2023, 2023  CPD \u00b6 134 at  2.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning \nof solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; t o be reasonable, and therefore \nvalid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole \nand in a reasonable manner.  Crew Training Int \u2019l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb. 7, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6 53 at 4.  An ambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations \nof the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible; a patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error.  FFLPro, LLC,  \nB-411427.2, Sept.  22, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6  289 at  10.  Where a patent ambiguity is not \nchallenged prior to the submission of solicitation responses, we will not consider  Page 19 B-423366 et al.  subsequent untimely arguments asserting the protester\u2019s own interpretation of the \nambiguous provisions.  Id.  \n As an initial matter, we note that the solicitation here required resumes for seven key personnel positions.  However, table 2 lists 16 (not 7) positions and specifies that these positions are for functional areas that require \u201cexpert level expertise.\u201d  AR , Tab 22, PWS \nat 50.  With respect to these positions, the PWS notes that the contractor would be \nrequired to \u201cretain personnel with management and technical knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience needed to accomplish the performance of work under this task order,\u201d but contains no specific proposal submission requirements.  Id.  The PWS \nalso specifically notes that \u201c[s]ome, but not[] all[,] expert -level positions will also be \nidentified as key technical positions.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, a review of the two tables shows little \noverlap between the 16 positions listed in table 2 and the 7 \u201cKey Technical Personnel\u201d \npositions listed in table 3.  Compare id.  at 50-51 with id.  at 52.  For example, the \nrequired key positions of network senior SME and cyber security senior SME are listed among the key personnel positions in table 3 without any directly equivalent positions \namong the expert -level positions in table 2.  Id.  \n Further, the record shows that the two positions --virtualization infrastructure senior SME \nand virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME --have materially different certification \nrequirements in addition to the VMware certification.  The virtualization infrastructure senior SME position requires a \u201c[Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)]:  Core Infrastructure\u201d certification , while the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME requires \na cloud- related certification of \u201cAzure Administrator Associate OR  AWS Certified \nSolutions Architect --Associate . . . OR CompTIA Cloud+\u201d or \u201cMCSE Cloud Platform & \nInfrastructure.\u201d  Id. at 51-52.   \n Reading the solicitation as a whole in a manner that gives effect to these provisions, the only reasonable interpretation is that the virtualization infrastructure senior SME detailed in table 2 and the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME in table 3 are two different \npositions.  Of the two, only the virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME is designated \nas a key person to be evaluated under the key personnel resume factor, and this position requires a VMware certification without the \u201cadvanced\u201d designation.  Moreover, even if it was reasonable for the protester to interpret the two positions to be one and the same, solicitation terms providing different certification requirements for the same position would be an obvious or glaring error that constitutes a patent ambiguity, which should have been protested prior to the submission of solicitation responses.  FFLPro, LLC,  supra.   We will not now consider the protester\u2019s untimely arguments asserting its \nown interpretation of the patently ambiguous provisi on.  \n The record here shows --and the protester does not dispute--that Peraton\u2019s resume for \nits proposed virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME had the VMware certified \nprofessional certification.  See AR, Tab  40, Peraton\u2019s Key Personnel Proposal at  13.  \nAccordingly, we find nothing unreasonable in the agency\u2019s finding that the awardee\u2019s proposed virtualization\/ cloud computing senior SME satisfied the solicitation\u2019s \ncertification requirement.     Page 20 B-423366 et al.  Betterment  \n \nThe protester next asserts that the agency unreasonably failed to credit DirectViz\u2019s proposal for multiple additional betterments.  Protest at  59-64.  The protester also \ncontends that the agency treated offerors disparately by crediting Peraton with a betterment for proposing data- driven dashboards while failing to credit DirectViz for a \nsimilar aspect of its proposal.  Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency \nresponds that it evaluated the offerors\u2019 proposed betterments in accordance with the solicitation and asserts that the protester\u2019s arguments amount to nothing more than \ndisagreement with the agency\u2019s reasonable judgment.  COS\/MOL at  73-76; Supp. \nCOS\/MOL at 39-43.  Based on our review of the record, we agree with the agency.  \n As noted above, the solicitation instructed offerors to propose \u201cbetterments,\u201d defined as any instance where the proposed solution exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  TOPR at  16, 20.  Proposed betterments would be evaluated \nfor \u201cthe value to the Government of any betterments that are promised in the solution for transitioning from a [RCC] to a [GCC] that can help better coordinate cyber space operations across the world, and all five of the RCCs.\u201d  Id.  at 20.  In evaluating m ultiple \nbetterments listed in DirectViz\u2019s proposal, the agency found that only one of them offered a betterment that exceeds the requirement in a way that is meaningful to the agency.  See AR, Tab  63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1-2.  While the protester \nclaims that all of its proposed betterments deserved credit, the record provides no basis for questioning the agency\u2019s evaluative judgment.  \n For example, the agency declined to find a betterment in the protester\u2019s proposal of a \ncentralized service delivery for a global network because \u201cit is currently a requirement under [PWS] paragraph 3.3.3.1.\u201d  Id.  at 1.  The agency supplements this record by \nfurther explaining that the protester\u2019s description of its centralized service delivery did not meaningfully exceed the cited PWS requirement for the contractor to \u201cperform . . . support functions to remotely operate, monitor, sustain, and secure the Ent erprise \nnetwork within GCC responsibility boundaries.\u201d  AR, Tab 83, Technical Evaluation \nBoard (TEB) Chair Decl. at  6; AR, Tab 22, PWS  \u00a7 3.3.3.1.  While the protester \ndisagrees with this assessment, it does not meaningfully explain how its proposed betterm ent exceeded the PWS requirement.   \n   \nThe protester also asserts that the agency treated DirectViz and Peraton disparately when the agency credited a betterment for Peraton\u2019s proposed dashboard approach while declining to credit a betterment for a similar aspect of DirectViz\u2019s proposal.  Comme nts & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32.  The agency responds that the difference in \nthe evaluation is directly attributable to the differences in the offerors\u2019 proposals.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 39-41.   \n It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement law that a contracting agency must treat all  offerors  equally and evaluate proposals  evenhandedly against the solicitation\u2019 s \nrequirements and evaluation criteria.  See UltiSat, Inc., B-416809 et al., Dec.  18, 2018, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 6 at 9.  Where a protester  alleges unequal treatment in a technical  Page 21 B-423366 et al.  evaluation, it must show that the differences in the evaluation did not stem  from \ndifferences between the proposals .  See Camber Corp., B -413505, Nov. 10, 2016, 2016 \nCPD \u00b6 350 at  8.  To prevail on an allegation of disparate treatment, a protester must \nshow that the agency  unreasonably downgraded its proposal  for aspects that were \nsubstantively indistinguishable from, or nearly  identical to, those contained in other \nproposals .  See Battelle Mem'l Inst., B -418047.3, B -418047.4, May  18, 2020,  2020 CPD \n\u00b6 176 at  5. \n \nHere, the agency found one betterment in each of DirectViz\u2019s and Peraton\u2019s proposals.  See AR, Tab  65, TODD at  35.  Peraton\u2019s betterment was assessed for the firm\u2019s \napproach to automated workflows, which \u201cuses the Army\u2019s existing tool suite . . . to create data- driven dashboards that enable the Army to fuse, interpret, and visualize \nlarge amount s of data.\u201d  AR, Tab 62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  The \nevaluators detailed their rationale for this finding as follows:  \n \nAs the [GCC] scope of responsibilities grows in breadth and depth, responding to the Army\u2019s information technology needs will become more demanding.  This value- added method provides the GCC with additional \ntechnical experience in the tool suite identified above in the Offeror\u2019s \nproposal.  Also, the method leans on software tools provided by existing systems of record, such as Army 365, thereby preventing further tools adoption ( i.e. tool bloat).  Employing methods that augment system of \nrecords, such as Ar my Enterprise Service Management Platform \n(AESMP), will enable the GCC to perform newer obligations more effectively and efficiently.  This is above what is required in the PWS, \nAppendix C, Table 2: Incident Management Standards, (1)  Critical Incident \nResp onse rates of 94 [percent] within an hour, (2) High-  and medium -\npriority incidents exceed response rates of 92 [percent] within 2 core hours and 5 core hours, respectively.  \n Id.     \n While the protester asserts that it also deserved credit for proposing data- driven \ndashboards, Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  30-32, the record does not support this \nassertion.  In this regard, the agency considered DirectViz\u2019s proposed approach of proposing a \u201c[DELETED]\u201d that will provide \u201c[DELETED],\u201d allowing \u201c[DELETED].\u201d  AR, Tab 63, DirectViz Betterment Evaluation at  1 (quoting AR, Tab  33, DirectViz \nBetterment Proposal at  1).  In declining to assess a betterment for this approach, the \nevaluators found that DirectViz\u2019s solution was \u201ccurrently a requirement under PWS paragraph 3.4.2.6, \u201d which required \u201c[c] oordination with Web Services personnel to \ndevelop and maintain visualizations and dashboards in support of operations .\u201d  Id.; \nsee AR, Tab  22, PWS \u00a7  3.4.2.6.   \n The TEB chair further explains the difference between the offerors\u2019 approaches by stating that DirectViz\u2019s dashboard approach was \u201climited to a [DELETED], and did not improve response times for incident management standards.\u201d  AR, Tab 83, TEB Chair  Page 22 B-423366 et al.  Decl. at  6.  In contrast, as noted in the contemporaneous evaluation documentation and \nfurther explained by the TEB chair, Peraton\u2019s proposal \u201cdescribed the implementation of \na Real -Time Performance Monitor dashboard[]\u201d that went beyond the PWS -required \n[DELETED] to provide \u201cimprove[d] response times for incident management standards.\u201d  \nId. at 5; see AR, Tab  62, Peraton Betterment Evaluation at  1.  Although the protester \ndisagrees with the agency\u2019s assessment of the value in improved response times for incident management, Supp. Comments at  35-38, such disagreement alone does not \nestablish that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  Accordingly, we find no basis to sustain the protester\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation under this factor.  \n Oral Presentations  \n The protester next asserts that the agency failed to maintain an adequate record of oral presentations.  Specifically, DirectViz contends that the Army failed to document the content of oral presentations such that the record lacks an adequate basis on whi ch to \nassess the agency\u2019s evaluation.  Protest at  58-59; Comments  & 2nd Supp. Protest \nat 20-28.  The protester also disagrees with several of the agency\u2019s unfavorable findings \nas noted in the agency\u2019s documented evaluation of DirectViz\u2019s oral presentation.   \nProtest at  50-53.  We find the protester\u2019s arguments to be without merit.  \n As an initial matter, in challenging the agency\u2019s documentation of oral presentations, the protester cites to FAR section 15.102(e), which requires agencies to maintain a record \nof oral presentations, and relies in part on our decision in HomeSafe Alliance, LLC , \nB-418266.5 et al., Oct.  21, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  350.  We find, however, that the \nprotester\u2019s reliance on that FAR provision and our decision in HomeSafe  is misplaced \nbecause the procurement at issue here was a task order competition conducted under the procedures of FAR subpart  16.5.  As our Office has previously explained, a task \norder competition under FAR subpart 16.5 provides for a streamlined procurement process requiring less rigorous documentation.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, B-421134.2 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 90 at  13-14; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc ., \nB-419210, B -419210.2, Dec. 22, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 409 at  4-5.   \n Unlike the FAR provisions governing negotiated procurements conducted under FAR \npart 15, there is no requirement for a separate evaluation record for oral presentations \nin task order procurements conducted under FAR subpart 16.5.  Compare \nFAR 15.102(e), with FAR 16.505(b)(7).   More specifically, FAR section 16.505(b)(1)(ii) \nprovides that contracting officers may \u201cexercise broad discretion in developing appropriate order placement procedures,\u201d \u201ckeep submission requirements to a minimum,\u201d and \u201cuse streamlined procedures including oral presentations.\u201d  With respect \nto the required documentation in task order competitions, FAR  section 16.505(b)(7)(i)  \nrequires agencies  only to \u201c document in the contract file the rationale for placement and \nprice of each order, including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs \namong cost or price and non- cost considerations in making the award decision.\u201d   \n Here, the solicitation provided that the oral presentations \u201cmay or may not be recorded by the Government,\u201d and, in fact, the presentations were not recorded.  TOPR at  16;  Page 23 B-423366 et al.  COS\/MOL at 62.  The agency instead documented the oral presentations by retaining \nthe contemporaneous handwritten notes of the contracting officer and the three TEB \nmembers, who later convened a panel to prepare a consensus evaluation of the oral presentations.  COS\/MOL at  62; see AR, Tab  64, Oral Presentation Final Evaluation \nReport; AR, Tabs  70a, 70b, 70c, Individual Evaluator Notes.\n10   \n Based on our review of this record, we find sufficient contemporaneous documentation of the agency\u2019s evaluative judgments of the offerors\u2019 oral presentations.  Moreover, while the evaluators\u2019 notes do not document every aspect of the offerors\u2019 oral \npresent ations, they do provide the agency\u2019s documentation of the particular aspects of \nthe offerors\u2019 presentations upon which the evaluators based their evaluation \njudgments.\n11  Where the solicitation specifically advised offerors that the agency may \nnot record the oral presentations, we see nothing in the applicable laws or regulations that required the agency to go further and record or otherwise transcribe the content of the oral presentations, in exacting detail, when conducting a procurement under FAR \nsubpart 16.5.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra;  cf., Analytica, LLC , B-418966, \nNov. 9, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 365 at 7 (\u201cWe see no requirement in law or regulation that an \nagency go further to record oral presentations when conducting a procurement under subpart 8.4, and it is not our role to impose one where the FAR does not.\u201d).  \n In addition, while the protester generally challenges every unfavorable finding noted in the evaluation of its oral presentation, we find that the protester\u2019s assertions offer nothing more than its disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluative judgments.  See \nProtest at  50-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. Protest at  20-28.  The record shows that the \nagency documented several areas that DirectViz\u2019s presentation did not address before \nultimately assigning it the highest possible rating of high confidence.  See AR, Tab  64, \nOral Presentation Final Evaluation Report  at 12-16.  Despite asserting that it \u201cdisagrees \nwith these findings,\u201d the protester does not offer any specific statements to counter the \nagency\u2019s evaluation conclusions other than to generally aver that the protester \u201cbelieves it fully responded to each oral presentation question and fully addressed every \n \n10 In response to the protester\u2019s complaint that \u201c[m]uch of the evaluators\u2019 notes are \nillegible,\u201d Comments & Supp. Protest at  21, our Office requested that the agency \nprovide typed transcriptions of the evaluators\u2019 handwritten notes, and the agency supplemen ted the record with the requested transcriptions.  See AR, Tabs  70a(1), \n70b(1), 70c(1), Transcribed Individual Evaluator Notes.  \n11 We also reject the protester\u2019s assertion that the documentation is inadequate \nbecause the content of the evaluators\u2019 notes were internally inconsistent when compared to one another and the consensus evaluation.  See Comments & 2nd Supp. \nProtest at  23-27; Supp. Comments at  33.  It is well -settled that, following discussions \namong evaluators, an agency may reach consensus conclusions that do not reflect the initial assessments of individual evaluators or correct mistakes or misperceptions noted in an individual evaluator\u2019s assessment.  See Accenture Fed. Servs., LLC, supra at  14; \nsee e.g. , Unitec Distribution Sys ., B-419874, B -419874.2, Aug. 20, 2021, 2021 CPD \n\u00b6 307 at  4; Resource Applications, Inc ., B-274943.3, Mar. 5, 1997, 97- 1 CPD \u00b6 137 at  5.   Page 24 B-423366 et al.  requirement.\u201d  Protest at  50.  Although the protester faults the agency\u2019s failure to \nsufficiently record the details of the oral presentation and argues that the \ncontemporaneous evaluation is unclear and contradictory, the protester does not present any al ternative recollections of the content of its presentation to rebut the \nagency\u2019s documented evaluation.  On this record, we find no basis to fault the agency\u2019s evaluation of DirectViz\u2019s oral presentation.  \n The protester also contends that the agency\u2019s conduct of the oral presentations constituted discussions because, by asking a follow -up question at the end of each oral \npresentation, the agency allowed offerors to revise or add to what was presented, which amounted to allowing revised proposals.  Protest at  51-53; Comments & 2nd Supp. \nProtest at  28-30.  The protester argues that these alleged discussions were misleading \nand not meaningful because the agency asked only one question without affording DirectViz  an opportunity to address other \u201costensible gaps in DVS\u2019s oral presentation.\u201d  \nProtest at  52.  Based on the record before us, we find no merit to the protester\u2019s \ncontention that the agency\u2019s conduct of oral presentations constituted discussions.    As discussed above, the instant task order procurement was conducted under FAR subpart  16.5, and the solicitation specifically warned offerors that \u201cthe contracting \ntechniques under FAR part 15.3 do not apply\u201d and that \u201cFAR 15.3 procedures will not be utilized to review any subsequent award.\u201d  TOPR at  4.  With respect to oral \npresentations, the solicitation advised that the oral presentation was intended to be \u201can interactive exchange between the Offeror and the Government,\u201d which would be \u201cviewed as a component of the oral presentation itself [that did] not constitute discussions.\u201d  Id. at 17.  The solicitation further stated that the agency \u201cwill not ask \nquestions that will invite or allow the Offeror to change its Proposal\u201d and prohibited offerors from \u201cvolunteer[ing] any information that might be construed as changing its proposal.\u201d  Id. \n Each of the offerors were asked one follow -up question during oral presentations.  \nCOS\/MOL at 63; see AR, Tab  70d, Contracting Officer\u2019s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.  \nThe agency asserts that these limited follow -up questions were not discussions \nbecause they were specifically limited to clarifying the evaluators\u2019 understanding of the solution presented du ring the presentation and did not permit any proposal revisions.  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 38-39.  For example, the agency asked DirectViz to \u201cexpand upon \n[its] model to deny access to the remaining 550,000 end[ -]user devices for the same \ntouch- labor administrators,\u201d thus seeking more information on the model DirectViz \npresented in response to the third oral presentation question.  AR, Tab 70d, Contracting \nOfficer\u2019 s Oral Presentation Notes at  4.   \n While the protester argues that this question allowed DirectViz to supplement its oral presentations and thus constituted discussions, the protester does not elaborate on how--or even whether --its response to the follow -up question revised its presented \nsolution to the scenario- based oral presentation question.  As the protester points out, \nthe consensus evaluation report did not specifically  discuss DirectViz\u2019s response to the \nfollow- up question, but instead stated the evaluation conclusion that DirectViz  Page 25 B-423366 et al.  \u201cexplained an applicable solution to the problem presented in this question with an \nexpert level of understanding of the Entra ID system.\u201d  AR, Tab 64, Oral Presentation \nFinal Evaluation Report at  12.  The agency further found that DirectViz \u201ccorrectly \nidentified several key areas such as [DELETED], [DELETED], and [DELETED].\u201d  Id.  \nThe protester makes no showing--or even allegation--that it provided any information during the question- and-answer portion of the oral presentation that substantively \nrevised it s proposed solution or the agency\u2019s evaluation thereof.  On this record, we see \nno basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s carefully limited follow -up question constituted \ndiscussions.\n12  Accordingly, since the agency did not engage in discussions, we \nconclude the protester\u2019s allegation that the agency engaged in misleading discussions is without merit.  \n Cost Evaluations  \n The protester also asserts that the agency\u2019s cost realism analysis failed to consider offerors\u2019 unique technical approaches.  Protest at  64-66; Comments & 2nd Supp. \nProtest at  37-39.  We find no basis to sustain this protest ground.  \n When an agency evaluates proposals for the award of a cost -reimbursement contract or \ntask order, it must perform a cost realism analysis to determine the extent to which an offeror\u2019s proposed costs are realistic for the work to be performed.  FAR 15.305(a) (1), \n15.404- 1(d); IAP-C4ISR, LLC, B -421726.2 et al. , Feb.  12, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6  52 at  10.  \nAn offeror\u2019s costs are not dispositive because, regardless of the costs proposed, the government is bound to pay the contractor its actual and allowable costs.  FAR 16.505(b)(3); 15.305(a)(1); Engility Corp ., B-413120.3 et al., Feb.  14, 2017, 2017 CPD \n\u00b6 70 at 18.  An agency\u2019s cost realism analysis requires the exercise of informed \njudgment, and we review an agency\u2019s judgment in this area only to see that the analysis was reasonably based and not arbitrary.  Id .  The analysis need not achieve scientific \ncertainty; rather, the methodology used must be reasonably adequate and provide some measure of confidence that the agency\u2019s conclusions about the most probable costs for  \nan offeror\u2019s proposal are reasonable and realistic in view of other cost information reasonably available to the agency at the time of its evaluation.  TeleCommunication \nSys., Inc ., B-413265, B -413265.2, Sept.  21, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  266 at  10. \n In challenging the agency\u2019s cost realism analysis, the protester essentially asserts that the agency\u2019s methodology  was flawed because the Army did not have offerors\u2019 \ntechnical approaches to compare against their respective cost proposals.  We note, however, that the solicitation did not require the submission of an offeror\u2019s technical \n \n12 We note, at any rate, that even if we were to conclude that the agency\u2019s limited \nfollow- up question constituted discussions, the protester does not explain how the \ndiscussions were misleading or not meaningful.  Specifically, while the protester takes issue with each unfavorable finding noted in the agency\u2019s evaluation of DirectViz\u2019s oral \npresentation, the protester does not explain why the agency was required to raise those findings in discussions when they were not significant enough to prevent the agenc y \nfrom assigning a high confidence rating to DirectViz\u2019s oral presentation.   Page 26 B-423366 et al.  approach for performing the requirement.  Instead, the non- cost\/price portion of offerors\u2019 \nproposals was comprised of prior experience, key personnel resumes, proposed \nbetterments, and oral presentations responding to scenario- based problems.  TOPR \nat 9-18.  With respect to the assessment of cost realism, the solicitation set out the \nfollowing specific methodology:  \n \nThe Government\u2019s objective for cost realism is to utilize Economic Research Institute\u2019s [(ERI)] Salary Assessor tool unburdened hourly rates using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 using Tucson, Arizona locality based on the years of \nexperience proposed for that ERI labor category at the 50th Percentile for each Offeror for direct rate [Most Probable Cost] adjustments for evaluation purposes for the Labor Categories specified in Attachment V GCC Cost WorkBook.  Offerors are c autioned that proposing unburdened \nhourly rates less than the 50th Percentile (ERI Survey Mean Hourly Salary) using NAICS 541519 for Tucson, Arizona may be determined high risk on maintaining the current staff; may have a MPC adjustment performed; and\/or m ay be determined unrealistic and ineligible based on \nGovernment discretion.  \n Id. at 21.   \n As an initial matter, we find no merit to the protester\u2019s argument that the oral presentations constituted the offerors\u2019 unique technical approaches that the agency was required to consider in its cost realism analysis.  In this regard, we note that offerors \nwere required to prepare their oral presentations \u201cbased on the questions and problem statements received in person two hours before the oral presentation.\u201d  TOPR at  16.  \nAlthough offerors were instructed to \u201cbe prepared to discuss their solutions to the questions and problem statements received,\u201d the solicitation did not require offerors to present their technical approaches for performing the overall requirement.  See id.   \nThus, nothing in the solicitation informed offerors that the content of their oral presentations would be considered their unique technical approach upon which the agency would base any cost -realism adjustments made.   \n Moreover, we note that the protester does not challenge the solicitation\u2019s stated methodology of using ERI labor rates for purposes of the cost realism analysis, nor does the protester point to any error in the agency\u2019s extensive cost realism analysis using those rates.  See generally, AR, Tab  56, Cost Evaluation Report.  Instead, the \nprotester generally avers that \u201c[i]f the Agency performed the required analysis\u201d of considering offerors\u2019 unique technical approaches, \u201cit likely would have adjusted Peraton\u2019s  proposed costs upward or, alternatively, adjusted [DirectViz\u2019s] proposed costs \ndownward, thereby narrowing or eliminating Peraton\u2019s limited 0.3 percent cost advantage.\u201d  Protest at  65.  The protester, however, fails to specifically allege any \nparticular aspect of its own--or the awardee\u2019s --unique technical approach that should \nhave resulted in an adjustment of proposed costs.  See Protest at 64-66; Comments & \n2nd Supp. Protest at  37-39.  Therefore, we dismiss this ground for failure to state a  Page 27 B-423366 et al.  sufficient factual or legal basis of protest.  4  C.F.R. \u00a7  21.5(f) ; see Midwest Tube \nFabricators, Inc.,  B-407166, B -407167, Nov.  20, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 324 at 3 (explaining \nthat our Bid Protest Regulations \u201ccontemplate that protesters will provide, at a minimum, \neither allegations or evidence sufficient, if uncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action\u201d).    In addition, we find that the solicitation clearly advised offerors of the methodology by which the agency planned to evaluate cost realism in the absence of a technical approach submission.  To the extent the protester argues that the agency\u2019s cost realis m \nanalysis should have included more--such as requiring the submission of technical approach proposals --we find such arguments to be untimely.  Our Bid Protest \nRegulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests and our timeliness rules specifically require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation \nthat are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1); see Quadrant Training Sols. , JV, B-422339, May  7, \n2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6  116 at  7.  Since DirectViz did not challenge these terms before the \ninitial closing date for proposals, any such challenge now would be untimely.   \n CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the agency\u2019s OCI evaluation of Peraton\u2019s proposal was unreasonable.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will only sustain a protest where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving \nthe award.  OGSystems, LLC , B-417026 et al., Jan.  22, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6  66 at  18.  \nHere, in light of the agency\u2019s unreasonable OCI review, we find that DirectViz has established the requisite competitive prejudice as the offeror next in line for award in the event Peraton is disqualified due to an unmitigated OCI.  \n We recommend that the agency, consistent with our decision, meaningfully consider, evaluate, and document its findings about whether Peraton possesses an OCI arising from its performance of the ARCYBER task order.  In the event the agency identifies an OCI, it should either determine what actions would be appropriate to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the identified OCI, or determine that a waiver of the identified OCI would be \nappropriate.  We also recommend that the protester be reimbursed for its costs of filing \nand pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.  4  C.F.R. \u00a7  21.8(d).  The  \nprotester\u2019s certified claims for such costs, detailing the time expended and costs incurred, must be submitted directly to the agency within 60 days after receipt of this decision.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.8(f).  \n The protest is sustained.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

The protester primarily asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n  Page 2 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   \nWe deny the protest.   \n BACKGROUND  \n The RFP, issued on August 2, 2022, sought to procure the services of certified athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists for the USMC\u2019s SMIP.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP amend. 0005, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at \u00b6\u00b6 1.2- 1.3.  \nSMIP was created to reduce injuries and lost workdays caused by musculoskeletal \ninjuries.  Id.   The RFP anticipates that the trainers and specialists will provide state- of-\nthe art professional services to assist injured marines and accelerate their return to duty.  Id. \n The RFP, set aside for small businesses, contemplated the award of a fixed- price \nindefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract to be performed over five 1- year ordering \nperiods, with the option to extend the contract for an additional six months.  AR, Tab 1, RFP at 73.  Award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value to the government based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  management and staffing approach, past performance, and price.  RFP  \namend. 0005 at 17- 20.  Offerors were to submit their proposals in four volumes, each \nwith its own page limit.  The volume for management and staffing approach, the only factor at issue here, had a 50- page limit.  Id . at 14.   \n Under the management and staffing approach factor, the agency would evaluate each offeror\u2019s approach to meeting the PWS requirements.  Specifically, the agency would \nevaluate the offeror\u2019s experience in managing similar programs and how the offeror would provide continuous, quality, and timely support.  The agency would also evaluate the offeror\u2019s plan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists.  This plan was to include an approach to mitigating competition from other firms seeking to hire the trainers and specialists.  Finally, the agency would \nevaluate the offeror\u2019s operational plan for effective communication between the government and the offeror\u2019s employees.  RFP amend. 0005 at 19.  Under this factor, the agency would assign a rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or \nunacceptable.  Id . at 18.   \n The USMC received proposals from 11 vendors, including KSHS, the incumbent contractor, and Cognito.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 7.  In September 2024, the agency conducted discussions with offerors and reevaluated pr oposals, including the technical and past performance volumes.  Id. \nat 8.  In its discussions letter to Cognito, the agency informed the firm that its management and staffing approach volume had been assigned three strengths and three weaknesses.  The agency also asked Cognito to respond to three questions.  AR, Tab 26, Cognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2.

The agency determined that C ognito\u2019s management and staffing approach volume no \nlonger had any weaknesses.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.  This round of  Page 3 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations yielded the final ratings for the technical and past performance volumes.  \nCOS\/MOL at 8.  The agency made award to Cognito on November 14.  Id .   \n On December 2, KSHS filed a protest with our Office challenging the award, asserting that the USMC misevaluated proposals, conducted misleading discussions, unreasonably failed to find that Cognito was not a responsible contractor, and made an unreasonable source selection decision.  Kako\u2019o Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, LLC, B-421127.2, Jan. 6, 2025 (unpublished decision) at 1.  The agency chose to take \ncorrective action, stating that it would review the evaluations and make a new source selection decision.  Id.  As a result of the agency\u2019s proposed corrective action, we \ndismissed the protest as academic on January 6, 2025.  Id .   \n As part of the agency\u2019s corrective action, KSHS and Cognito were both invited to update their price volumes, but only KSHS submitted an updated price volume.  COS\/MOL at 9.  The agency\u2019s finalized evaluation included the technical and past performance rati ngs \nfrom September 2024, and the reevaluation of KSHS\u2019s updated price from February 2025.  The final ratings were as follows:  \n \n KSHS  Cognito  \nManagement and Staffing Approach  Good  Outstanding  \nPast Performance  Satisfactory  Satisfactory  \nPrice  $63,869,786  $61,288,781  \n AR, Tab 22, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 2.   \n \nThe agency made various findings and determinations for both proposals under the \nmanagement and staffing approach factor.  The agency determined that KSHS\u2019s proposal demonstrated a thorough approach to meeting the PWS requirements and a thorough understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id . at 3.  The agency \nassigned KSHS\u2019s proposal one strength for its experience under the incumbent contract and assigned the KSHS proposal an overall rating of good.  Id .  \n The agency determined that Cognito\u2019s proposal demonstrated an exceptional approach to meeting the PWS requirements and an exceptional understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id.  The agency assigned Cognito\u2019s proposal three strengths.  One \nstrength was assigned for the firm\u2019s proposed [ DELETED] and another strength was \nassigned for Cognito\u2019s experience staffing similar efforts for other Department of Defense organizations.  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency assigned a third strength for Cognito\u2019s \nproposed [DELETED].   Id.  The agency assigned Cognito\u2019s proposal an overall rating of \noutstanding.  Id. at 3.   \n Regarding past performance, the agency determined that it had reasonable confidence that both offerors would successfully perform the contract.  Id .  The agency further \nnoted that both offeror\u2019s prices were fair and reasonable.  Id.  In comparing the two \nproposals, the agency noted that Cognito\u2019s proposal was superior to KSHS\u2019s proposal under the management and staffing approach factor because it provided benefits that  Page 4 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  KSHS\u2019s proposal did not.  Id. at 5.  Considering all this, the agency noted that the \nmanagement and staffing approach factor was significantly more important than past \nperformance and price, and that the first two factors were significantly more important than price when combined.  A s a result the agency determined that Cognito\u2019s proposal \nwas the best value for the agency because of its superior technical approach and 4.2 percent lower price.  Id.  On February 5, the agency made award to Cognito and notified \nKSHS the same day.  COS\/MOL at 12.  KSHS subsequently received a debriefing, and this protest followed.    DISCUSSION  KSHS raises several challenges to the evaluation of proposals under the management and staffing approach factor.  We have considered them all and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that in reviewing protests challenging an agency \u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate \nproposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the \nsolicitation \u2019s evaluation criteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.

Servs., LLC , B-421392.13, B -421392.14, Oct. 9, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 243 at 4.   \n Evaluation of Cognito\u2019s Proposal  \n KSHS asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito\u2019s management and staffing approach volume by improperly considering portions of the proposal that exceeded the page limits.  Supp. Comments at 2- 10.  KSHS first points to Cognito\u2019s \noriginal propos al and asserts that it exceeded the page limit by one page and argues \nthat this one page included information that informed part of the agency\u2019s evaluation.  KSHS contends that, had the agency properly ignored this information in accordance with the page l imit requirements, Cognito would have received a lower rating and KSHS \nwould likely have received award.  Id . at 2 -7.  KSHS next points to Cognito\u2019s FPR and \nasserts that it also exceeded the page limits.  KSHS contends that Cognito supplied its revisions in a document separate from its original proposal and did not incorporate them into its original proposal, therefore including an additional six pages that exceeded the page limits.  Id . at 7 -9.  KSHS argues that Cognito\u2019s FPR was what the agency relied on \nin assigning Cognito a rating of outstanding as its FPR cured the three weaknesses the agency had previously assigned.  KSHS contends that had the agency properly ignored Cognito\u2019s FPR as exceeding the page limits, Cognito would have received a lower technical rating.  Id .  \n The USMC responds that, even if it improperly considered the additional pages in both Cognito\u2019s original proposal and its FPR, then the agency essentially waived the page limit requirements and KSHS was not prejudiced by the waiver.  The agency contends that KSHS was not prejudiced because KSHS\u2019s management and staffing approach \nvolume was 20 pages below the page limit.  As a result, the agency argues, KSHS cannot show that it would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements by adding five extra  Page 5 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages to its proposal because it chose to submit a proposal that was already 20 pages \nunder the limit.  Supp. MOL at 6- 7, 12 -13.   \n The protester responds that this standard of prejudice is inapplicable.  KSHS argues that the proper standard of prejudice is that had the agency excluded the extra pages, Cognito would not have been next in line for award and KSHS would likely have receiv ed the award, and therefore KSHS was competitively prejudiced.  Supp. \nComments at 9- 10.  \n While we agree that the agency effectively waived the solicitation\u2019s 50- page limit for the \nmanagement and staffing approach volume in evaluating Cognito\u2019s proposal, we find that the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s waiver .  In \ngeneral, offerors must prepare their proposals within the format limitations set out in an agency \u2019s solicitation, including any applicable page limits.  DynCorp Int\u2019l LLC , \nB-411126.4, et al. , Dec. 20, 2016, 2017 CPD \u00b6 333 at 14.  Offerors that exceed a \nsolicitation \u2019s established page limitations assume the risk that the agency will not \nconsider the excess pages.  Id.  However, an agency may waive compliance with a \nmaterial solicitation requirement, such as page limitations, in awarding a contract if the award will meet the agency\u2019s actual needs without prejudice to other offerors.  DRS Network & Imaging Sys., LLC , B-413409, B -413409.2, Oct. 25, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 315 \nat 9; LASEOD Group, LLC , B-405888, Jan. 10, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 45 at 5.  \n The solicitation required that offerors submit management and staffing approach volumes that were no more than 50 pages in length.  RFP amend. 0005 at 14.  Cognito\u2019s original management and staffing approach volume is 51 pages long based \non the Adobe PDF pagination, which includes every page in the volume, starting with the cover page.  AR, Tab 8.1, Cognito\u2019s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1-51.  Based on the Adobe PDF pagination, page 1 of the volume is the cover page with \nno substantive inform ation on it and page 51 of the volume includes some substantive \ninformation of Cognito\u2019s approach.  Id. at 1, 51.   \n Cognito\u2019s response to the discussions letter, submitted as its FPR, consists of six pages in total according to the Adobe PDF pagination.  Four of these pages include Cognito\u2019s response to the three questions raised by the agency.  AR, Tab 11, Cognito\u2019s Fi nal \nProposal Revisions at 2- 5.  Cognito\u2019s response does not state that these pages replace \npages in its original proposal, and Cognito did not submit a revised proposal including these new pages, but rather submitted these pages in response to the discussi ons \nletter.  Id. at 1.  The solicitation did not provide any information regarding page \nlimitations for FPRs.  Additionally, while the discussions letters stated that responses would be \u201cincorporated into [offerors\u2019] Final Proposal Revisions,\u201d the discussions letters did not state that revisions were not subject to the solicitation\u2019s page limits.  AR, Tab 26, \nCognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2. \n As a result, based on our review of the record, we conclude that the agency effectively waived the management and staffing approach volume page limit of 50 pages for Cognito\u2019s original proposal and its FPR.  The agency allowed Cognito an additional five  Page 6 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages in total beyond the limit \u2013  1 from its original proposal, and 4 from its FPR, \neffectively waiving the requirement regarding page limitations.  However, this wavier \ndoes not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; and where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  DRS, supra  at 10.  In this regard, even where an \nagency waives a material solicitation requirement, our Office will not sustain the protest unless the protester can demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the waiver,  i.e., where \nthe protester would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements.  Id.; Cerner Corp. , \nB-293093, B -293093.2, Feb. 2, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 34 at 7 n. 7.  In cases where the \nprotester argues that an agency waived a certain requirement, prejudice does not mean that, had the agency failed to waive the requirement, the awardee would have been unsuc cessful.  LASEOD, supra.  Rather, the pertinent question is whether the prot ester \nwould have submitted a different offer that would have had a reasonable possibility of being selected for award had it known that the requirement would be waived.  Id . \n KSHS\u2019s original management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages based on the Adobe PDF pagination.  AR, Tab 5.1, KSHS\u2019s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1- 31.  Its FPR only affected its price volume, which had no page limitations.  \nRFP amend. 0005 at 14; AR, Tab 25, KSHS Discussions Letter at 1.  As a result, KSHS\u2019s final page count for its management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages, which is 19 pages below the 50- page limit.  In order for KSHS to be prejudiced \nby the agency\u2019s waive r of page limits for the management and staffing approach \nvolume, KSHS would have needed to demonstrate how it would have altered its volume to its competitive advantage had it been aware that it could use an additional five pages.  As KSHS\u2019s volume is 19 pages below the limit, KSHS has not argued and cannot show it would have made use of an additional five pages to its competitive advantage.  Thus, the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s waiver, and we deny this aspect of KS HS\u2019s protest.  Cerner, supra; LASEOD, supra . \n KSHS next argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito\u2019s management and staffing approach volume because it did not document whether Cognito\u2019s approach to locating, recruiting, and retaining athletic trainers met the solicitation\u2019s requirements.  KSHS also argues that even if the USMC had documented this aspect of the proposal, its conclusion that Cognito\u2019s approach met this requirement is unreasonable because Cognito is using the same approach that was negatively rated in one of its past performance references.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8; Supp. Comments at 10- 12.   \n The USMC responds that the record is sufficiently documented because it conducted its evaluation in accordance with the RFP\u2019s terms, and specifically noted any strengths, weaknesses, and significant weaknesses, and the rationale for them.  Supp. MOL at 14.   \nThe agency further asserts that it was not required to document proposal content that simply met criteria as agencies are not required to document every detail of their  Page 7 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations.  The agency also contends that KSHS has not argued or demonstrated that \nCognito\u2019s technical volume does not meet the requirement regarding recruitment and retainer, but rather argues only that the agency should have evaluated Cognito\u2019s proposal in a manner inconsistent with the solicitation criteria\u2013 that is, by considering \npast performance ratings in the technical evaluation.  Id . at 15- 16.  \n We find that the record is sufficiently documented.  While an agency \u2019s evaluation \njudgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show it is not arbitrary, a failure to discuss every detail regarding the relative merit of a proposal in an evaluation decision document does not affect the validity of the evaluation.  Artek Constr. Co., B -418657, \nB-418657.2, July 17, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 285 at 9 n.14 (denying protester\u2019s argument \nthat the agency failed to document its evaluation where the evaluation did not detail why a portion of the protester\u2019s proposal was inadequate because agencies are not required to discuss every detail of the relative merit of a proposal).  Additionally, as noted below, post-protest explanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be \nconsidered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id. \n The RFP required that offerors provide a \u201cplan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength conditioning coaches who meet or exceed the minimum standards.\u201d  RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  In its technical evaluations, the agency noted strengt hs and weaknesses and cited to the portions of proposals supporting those \nassessments.  The agency also included a paragraph summarizing its findings for each proposal.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 4- 13.  The agency only notes portions \nof proposal s that merited strengths or demonstrated weaknesses and did not take note \nof portions that simply met requirements.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 4, 14.   \n Regarding Cognito\u2019s proposal, the agency noted the portions that merited strengths and displayed weaknesses.\n1  The agency summarized its view of Cognito\u2019s proposal in a \nparagraph, noting that it had an exceptional understanding of the requirements, excellent experience, and the agency expected Cognito could successfully perform the contract.  AR, Tab 17, Technica l Evaluations at 4- 7.  During the development of the \nprotest, the agency supplied additional statements from the contracting officer and the technical evaluation team (TET) chair to support these findings.  Again, post -protest \nexplanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  The contracting officer explains that the TET was to review the entirety of each proposal, but only document portions that \nexceeded the requirements or failed to meet them.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 3- 4.  The \ncontracting officer also states that the absence of any discussion about a particular requirement meant the offeror\u2019s proposal met that requirement.  Id. at 4.  The TET chair \nalso states that if a proposal met a requirement but did not exceed it, the TET did not note it.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.   \n \n1 The technical evaluation notes how these weaknesses were cured following FPRs.  \nAR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.    Page 8 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   \nHere, the record shows that the agency considered the contents of each proposal and documented its evaluation.  In this regard, the agency\u2019s post -protest conclusions are \nreasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  The protester is incorrect that  the \nagency failed to document its evaluation simply because it utilized a methodology of documenting only the portions of proposals that exceeded or failed to meet requirements and making no notations on portions that met requirements.  As a result, the protester has not shown that the agency failed to document its findings.  Konica Minolta Bus. Sols. USA, Inc. , B-418800, B -418800.2, Sep. 4, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 292 at \n6 n.4 (explaining that the agency\u2019s choice not to document all determinations of adequacy did not render the evaluation unreasonable or inadequately documented).   \nIn addition, we are not persuaded by the protester\u2019s argument that the agency should have considered Cognito\u2019s past performance information as part of its technical evaluation.  The RFP did not require such consideration, and the protester does not identif y any portion of the RFP that supports its argument.   \n Evaluation of KSHS\u2019s Proposal  \n KSHS argues that the agency should have assigned its management and staffing approach volume six additional strengths.  We have reviewed all KSHS\u2019s arguments and find that it has not demonstrated that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretio n not to assign additional strengths.  We address three examples below.    \n KSHS first asserts that its proposal should have been assigned a strength for its \u201cunparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its \nexperienced [human performance] program manager.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 14.  The agency responds that KSHS already received a strength for its experience, and there was no reason to assign an additional strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.  The protester counters that the agency did not address its program manager\u2019s \nexperience specifi cally, which merited a strength by itself, and therefore the agency has \nconceded this issue.  Supp. Comments at 14.   \n We are not persuaded.  The agency\u2019s response addressed KSHS\u2019s experience as the incumbent contractor, which would extend to its program manager\u2019s experience.  Compare Comments & Supp. Protest at 9 (asserting that the protester\u2019s proposal \nexceeded requirements with \u201cunparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its experienced [human performance] program manager\u201d) with  AR, \nTab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1 (stating that \u201cKSHS was provided a strength for experience. This proposal feature addresses incumbency and experience . . . on the previous SMIP contract.  No additional strength was distinguished in this proposed feature.\u201d).    Second, the protester\u2019s argument rests on a misunderstanding of the standard we apply when determining whether an agency reasonably exercised its discretion not to assign a strength.  The protester implies that because its experience exceeded the requirements, it is necessarily entitled to a strength.  This is incorrect.  A n agency \u2019s judgment of  Page 9 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  whether to assess unique strengths is a matter within the agency \u2019s discretion and one \nthat we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the evaluation \nwas unreasonable.   APC Constr., LLC, B -419771, July 13, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 258 at 8.  \nIt is up to the agency to determine whether an offering, even one that exceeds the requirements, merits a strength so long as the agency\u2019s decision has a reasonable basis.  The protester does not challenge t he agency\u2019s assertion that its experience was \nalready accounted for and neither does the protester demonstrate how the agency\u2019s decision not to assign a strength was unreasonable.  As a result, the protester\u2019s argument amounts to disagreement with the agency\u2019s decision which does not provide a basis  to sustain the protest.  APC, supra  at 10; The Ginn Group., Inc. , B-420165, \nB-420165.2, Dec. 22, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 17 at 9.   \n KSHS next asserts that it should have received a strength for proposing an \u201cuninterrupted transition in 15 days or less\u201d at the start of contract performance.  Supp. Comments at 15.  The agency responds that this offering did not merit a strength because t he awardee is required to commence performance on the performance start \ndate, and the agency viewed this offering as KSHS simply affirming that it would meet the requirement.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  The protester responds that its transition timeline is nevertheless clearly a benefit to the agency.  Supp. Comments at 15.  KSHS has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  The firm\u2019s response that this offering is a benefit does not demonstrate that the agency has been unreasonable, but simply expresses disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, which as stated above, does not provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  The Ginn Group , supra.  As a result, we deny this protest allegation.   \n \nFinally, KSHS asserts that it should have been assigned a strength for its compensation and comprehensive benefits package because its package identifies specific benefits that provide \u201can edge in hiring.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 16.  The agency responds that t his \nfeature in the KSHS proposal does not warrant a strength because it does not exceed the RFP\u2019s requirements or add value.  The agency explains that developing appropriate compensation and benefit packages to retain the workforce is the responsibility of  an \nemployer, and KSHS\u2019s offering meets the requirements but does not merit a strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  KSHS responds that its packages did merit a strength because its specific offerings provide KSHS a competitive edge.  Supp. Comments at 16.   \n While KSHS argues that these offerings provide it a competitive edge, KSHS has failed to show that the agency unreasonably failed to assign its proposal a strength in this area.  The RFP stated several times that offerors were to describe approaches that  \n       Page 10 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  demonstrated how they would retain talented staff and mitigate competition from other \nfirms for staff, RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  The agency argues that the protester\u2019s proposal met the RFP\u2019s requirements and KSHS has not otherwise asserted or established  that its offering exceeds these requirements.  As a result, the protester has \nprovided no basis to find that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretion not to assign KSHS\u2019s proposal a strength.\n 2  \n The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n2 KSHS asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the alleged flaws \nin the evaluation.  Where other challenges to an evaluation of quotations have been denied or otherwise dismissed, a challenge to the best -value determination based on \nthose allegations does not afford a basis to sustain the protest.   Facility Servs. Mgmt., \nInc., B-422259.2, Sept. 24, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 233 at 7.

The protester primarily asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated proposals.   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n  Page 2 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   \nWe deny the protest.   \n BACKGROUND  \n The RFP, issued on August 2, 2022, sought to procure the services of certified athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists for the USMC\u2019s SMIP.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP amend. 0005, Performance Work Statement (PWS) at \u00b6\u00b6 1.2- 1.3.  \nSMIP was created to reduce injuries and lost workdays caused by musculoskeletal \ninjuries.  Id.   The RFP anticipates that the trainers and specialists will provide state- of-\nthe art professional services to assist injured marines and accelerate their return to duty.  Id. \n The RFP, set aside for small businesses, contemplated the award of a fixed- price \nindefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract to be performed over five 1- year ordering \nperiods, with the option to extend the contract for an additional six months.  AR, Tab 1, RFP at 73.  Award would be made to the offeror whose proposal represented the best value to the government based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  management and staffing approach, past performance, and price.  RFP  \namend. 0005 at 17- 20.  Offerors were to submit their proposals in four volumes, each \nwith its own page limit.  The volume for management and staffing approach, the only factor at issue here, had a 50- page limit.  Id . at 14.   \n Under the management and staffing approach factor, the agency would evaluate each offeror\u2019s approach to meeting the PWS requirements.  Specifically, the agency would \nevaluate the offeror\u2019s experience in managing similar programs and how the offeror would provide continuous, quality, and timely support.  The agency would also evaluate the offeror\u2019s plan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength and conditioning specialists.  This plan was to include an approach to mitigating competition from other firms seeking to hire the trainers and specialists.  Finally, the agency would \nevaluate the offeror\u2019s operational plan for effective communication between the government and the offeror\u2019s employees.  RFP amend. 0005 at 19.  Under this factor, the agency would assign a rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or \nunacceptable.

In September 2024, the agency conducted discussions with offerors and reevaluated pr oposals, including the technical and past performance volumes.  Id. \nat 8.  In its discussions letter to Cognito, the agency informed the firm that its management and staffing approach volume had been assigned three strengths and three weaknesses.  The agency also asked Cognito to respond to three questions.  AR, Tab 26, Cognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2.  Cognito responded to the questions in a \ndocument submitted as its final proposal revision (FPR).  AR, Tab 11, Cognito\u2019s FPR.  The agency determined that C ognito\u2019s management and staffing approach volume no \nlonger had any weaknesses.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.  This round of  Page 3 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations yielded the final ratings for the technical and past performance volumes.  \nCOS\/MOL at 8.  The agency made award to Cognito on November 14.  Id .   \n On December 2, KSHS filed a protest with our Office challenging the award, asserting that the USMC misevaluated proposals, conducted misleading discussions, unreasonably failed to find that Cognito was not a responsible contractor, and made an unreasonable source selection decision.  Kako\u2019o Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, LLC, B-421127.2, Jan. 6, 2025 (unpublished decision) at 1.  The agency chose to take \ncorrective action, stating that it would review the evaluations and make a new source selection decision.  Id.  As a result of the agency\u2019s proposed corrective action, we \ndismissed the protest as academic on January 6, 2025.  Id .   \n As part of the agency\u2019s corrective action, KSHS and Cognito were both invited to update their price volumes, but only KSHS submitted an updated price volume.  COS\/MOL at 9.  The agency\u2019s finalized evaluation included the technical and past performance rati ngs \nfrom September 2024, and the reevaluation of KSHS\u2019s updated price from February 2025.  The final ratings were as follows:  \n \n KSHS  Cognito  \nManagement and Staffing Approach  Good  Outstanding  \nPast Performance  Satisfactory  Satisfactory  \nPrice  $63,869,786  $61,288,781  \n AR, Tab 22, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 2.   \n \nThe agency made various findings and determinations for both proposals under the \nmanagement and staffing approach factor.  The agency determined that KSHS\u2019s proposal demonstrated a thorough approach to meeting the PWS requirements and a thorough understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id . at 3.  The agency \nassigned KSHS\u2019s proposal one strength for its experience under the incumbent contract and assigned the KSHS proposal an overall rating of good.  Id .  \n The agency determined that Cognito\u2019s proposal demonstrated an exceptional approach to meeting the PWS requirements and an exceptional understanding of the needs of the SMIP program.  Id.  The agency assigned Cognito\u2019s proposal three strengths.  One \nstrength was assigned for the firm\u2019s proposed [ DELETED] and another strength was \nassigned for Cognito\u2019s experience staffing similar efforts for other Department of Defense organizations.  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency assigned a third strength for Cognito\u2019s \nproposed [DELETED].   Id.  The agency assigned Cognito\u2019s proposal an overall rating of \noutstanding.  Id. at 3.   \n Regarding past performance, the agency determined that it had reasonable confidence that both offerors would successfully perform the contract.  Id .  The agency further \nnoted that both offeror\u2019s prices were fair and reasonable.  Id.  In comparing the two \nproposals, the agency noted that Cognito\u2019s proposal was superior to KSHS\u2019s proposal under the management and staffing approach factor because it provided benefits that  Page 4 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  KSHS\u2019s proposal did not.  Id. at 5.  Considering all this, the agency noted that the \nmanagement and staffing approach factor was significantly more important than past \nperformance and price, and that the first two factors were significantly more important than price when combined.  A s a result the agency determined that Cognito\u2019s proposal \nwas the best value for the agency because of its superior technical approach and 4.2 percent lower price.  Id.  On February 5, the agency made award to Cognito and notified \nKSHS the same day.  COS\/MOL at 12.  KSHS subsequently received a debriefing, and this protest followed.    DISCUSSION  KSHS raises several challenges to the evaluation of proposals under the management and staffing approach factor.  We have considered them all and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that in reviewing protests challenging an agency \u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate \nproposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the \nsolicitation \u2019s evaluation criteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.

Supp. Comments at 2- 10.  KSHS first points to Cognito\u2019s \noriginal propos al and asserts that it exceeded the page limit by one page and argues \nthat this one page included information that informed part of the agency\u2019s evaluation.  KSHS contends that, had the agency properly ignored this information in accordance with the page l imit requirements, Cognito would have received a lower rating and KSHS \nwould likely have received award.  Id . at 2 -7.  KSHS next points to Cognito\u2019s FPR and \nasserts that it also exceeded the page limits.  KSHS contends that Cognito supplied its revisions in a document separate from its original proposal and did not incorporate them into its original proposal, therefore including an additional six pages that exceeded the page limits.  Id . at 7 -9.  KSHS argues that Cognito\u2019s FPR was what the agency relied on \nin assigning Cognito a rating of outstanding as its FPR cured the three weaknesses the agency had previously assigned.  KSHS contends that had the agency properly ignored Cognito\u2019s FPR as exceeding the page limits, Cognito would have received a lower technical rating.  Id .  \n The USMC responds that, even if it improperly considered the additional pages in both Cognito\u2019s original proposal and its FPR, then the agency essentially waived the page limit requirements and KSHS was not prejudiced by the waiver.  The agency contends that KSHS was not prejudiced because KSHS\u2019s management and staffing approach \nvolume was 20 pages below the page limit.  As a result, the agency argues, KSHS cannot show that it would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements by adding five extra  Page 5 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages to its proposal because it chose to submit a proposal that was already 20 pages \nunder the limit.  Supp. MOL at 6- 7, 12 -13.   \n The protester responds that this standard of prejudice is inapplicable.  KSHS argues that the proper standard of prejudice is that had the agency excluded the extra pages, Cognito would not have been next in line for award and KSHS would likely have receiv ed the award, and therefore KSHS was competitively prejudiced.  Supp. \nComments at 9- 10.  \n While we agree that the agency effectively waived the solicitation\u2019s 50- page limit for the \nmanagement and staffing approach volume in evaluating Cognito\u2019s proposal, we find that the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s waiver .  In \ngeneral, offerors must prepare their proposals within the format limitations set out in an agency \u2019s solicitation, including any applicable page limits.  DynCorp Int\u2019l LLC , \nB-411126.4, et al. , Dec. 20, 2016, 2017 CPD \u00b6 333 at 14.  Offerors that exceed a \nsolicitation \u2019s established page limitations assume the risk that the agency will not \nconsider the excess pages.  Id.  However, an agency may waive compliance with a \nmaterial solicitation requirement, such as page limitations, in awarding a contract if the award will meet the agency\u2019s actual needs without prejudice to other offerors.  DRS Network & Imaging Sys., LLC , B-413409, B -413409.2, Oct. 25, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 315 \nat 9; LASEOD Group, LLC , B-405888, Jan. 10, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 45 at 5.  \n The solicitation required that offerors submit management and staffing approach volumes that were no more than 50 pages in length.  RFP amend. 0005 at 14.  Cognito\u2019s original management and staffing approach volume is 51 pages long based \non the Adobe PDF pagination, which includes every page in the volume, starting with the cover page.  AR, Tab 8.1, Cognito\u2019s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1-51.  Based on the Adobe PDF pagination, page 1 of the volume is the cover page with \nno substantive inform ation on it and page 51 of the volume includes some substantive \ninformation of Cognito\u2019s approach.  Id. at 1, 51.   \n Cognito\u2019s response to the discussions letter, submitted as its FPR, consists of six pages in total according to the Adobe PDF pagination.  Four of these pages include Cognito\u2019s response to the three questions raised by the agency.  AR, Tab 11, Cognito\u2019s Fi nal \nProposal Revisions at 2- 5.  Cognito\u2019s response does not state that these pages replace \npages in its original proposal, and Cognito did not submit a revised proposal including these new pages, but rather submitted these pages in response to the discussi ons \nletter.  Id. at 1.  The solicitation did not provide any information regarding page \nlimitations for FPRs.  Additionally, while the discussions letters stated that responses would be \u201cincorporated into [offerors\u2019] Final Proposal Revisions,\u201d the discussions letters did not state that revisions were not subject to the solicitation\u2019s page limits.  AR, Tab 26, \nCognito Discussions Letter at 1- 2. \n As a result, based on our review of the record, we conclude that the agency effectively waived the management and staffing approach volume page limit of 50 pages for Cognito\u2019s original proposal and its FPR.  The agency allowed Cognito an additional five  Page 6 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  pages in total beyond the limit \u2013  1 from its original proposal, and 4 from its FPR, \neffectively waiving the requirement regarding page limitations.  However, this wavier \ndoes not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; and where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  DRS, supra  at 10.  In this regard, even where an \nagency waives a material solicitation requirement, our Office will not sustain the protest unless the protester can demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the waiver,  i.e., where \nthe protester would have altered its proposal to its competitive advantage had it been given the opportunity to respond to the altered requirements.  Id.; Cerner Corp. , \nB-293093, B -293093.2, Feb. 2, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 34 at 7 n. 7.  In cases where the \nprotester argues that an agency waived a certain requirement, prejudice does not mean that, had the agency failed to waive the requirement, the awardee would have been unsuc cessful.  LASEOD, supra.  Rather, the pertinent question is whether the prot ester \nwould have submitted a different offer that would have had a reasonable possibility of being selected for award had it known that the requirement would be waived.  Id . \n KSHS\u2019s original management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages based on the Adobe PDF pagination.  AR, Tab 5.1, KSHS\u2019s Management and Staffing Approach Volume at 1- 31.  Its FPR only affected its price volume, which had no page limitations.  \nRFP amend. 0005 at 14; AR, Tab 25, KSHS Discussions Letter at 1.  As a result, KSHS\u2019s final page count for its management and staffing approach volume was 31 pages, which is 19 pages below the 50- page limit.  In order for KSHS to be prejudiced \nby the agency\u2019s waive r of page limits for the management and staffing approach \nvolume, KSHS would have needed to demonstrate how it would have altered its volume to its competitive advantage had it been aware that it could use an additional five pages.  As KSHS\u2019s volume is 19 pages below the limit, KSHS has not argued and cannot show it would have made use of an additional five pages to its competitive advantage.  Thus, the protester cannot demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s waiver, and we deny this aspect of KS HS\u2019s protest.  Cerner, supra; LASEOD, supra . \n KSHS next argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated Cognito\u2019s management and staffing approach volume because it did not document whether Cognito\u2019s approach to locating, recruiting, and retaining athletic trainers met the solicitation\u2019s requirements.  KSHS also argues that even if the USMC had documented this aspect of the proposal, its conclusion that Cognito\u2019s approach met this requirement is unreasonable because Cognito is using the same approach that was negatively rated in one of its past performance references.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 7- 8; Supp. Comments at 10- 12.   \n The USMC responds that the record is sufficiently documented because it conducted its evaluation in accordance with the RFP\u2019s terms, and specifically noted any strengths, weaknesses, and significant weaknesses, and the rationale for them.  Supp. MOL at 14.   \nThe agency further asserts that it was not required to document proposal content that simply met criteria as agencies are not required to document every detail of their  Page 7 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  evaluations.  The agency also contends that KSHS has not argued or demonstrated that \nCognito\u2019s technical volume does not meet the requirement regarding recruitment and retainer, but rather argues only that the agency should have evaluated Cognito\u2019s proposal in a manner inconsistent with the solicitation criteria\u2013 that is, by considering \npast performance ratings in the technical evaluation.  Id . at 15- 16.  \n We find that the record is sufficiently documented.  While an agency \u2019s evaluation \njudgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show it is not arbitrary, a failure to discuss every detail regarding the relative merit of a proposal in an evaluation decision document does not affect the validity of the evaluation.  Artek Constr. Co., B -418657, \nB-418657.2, July 17, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 285 at 9 n.14 (denying protester\u2019s argument \nthat the agency failed to document its evaluation where the evaluation did not detail why a portion of the protester\u2019s proposal was inadequate because agencies are not required to discuss every detail of the relative merit of a proposal).  Additionally, as noted below, post-protest explanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be \nconsidered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  Id. \n The RFP required that offerors provide a \u201cplan to locate, recruit, and retain athletic trainers and strength conditioning coaches who meet or exceed the minimum standards.\u201d  RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  In its technical evaluations, the agency noted strengt hs and weaknesses and cited to the portions of proposals supporting those \nassessments.  The agency also included a paragraph summarizing its findings for each proposal.  AR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 4- 13.  The agency only notes portions \nof proposal s that merited strengths or demonstrated weaknesses and did not take note \nof portions that simply met requirements.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 4, 14.   \n Regarding Cognito\u2019s proposal, the agency noted the portions that merited strengths and displayed weaknesses.\n1  The agency summarized its view of Cognito\u2019s proposal in a \nparagraph, noting that it had an exceptional understanding of the requirements, excellent experience, and the agency expected Cognito could successfully perform the contract.  AR, Tab 17, Technica l Evaluations at 4- 7.  During the development of the \nprotest, the agency supplied additional statements from the contracting officer and the technical evaluation team (TET) chair to support these findings.  Again, post -protest \nexplanations that fill in previously unrecorded details will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanation are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.  The contracting officer explains that the TET was to review the entirety of each proposal, but only document portions that \nexceeded the requirements or failed to meet them.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 3- 4.  The \ncontracting officer also states that the absence of any discussion about a particular requirement meant the offeror\u2019s proposal met that requirement.  Id. at 4.  The TET chair \nalso states that if a proposal met a requirement but did not exceed it, the TET did not note it.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.   \n \n1 The technical evaluation notes how these weaknesses were cured following FPRs.  \nAR, Tab 17, Technical Evaluations at 7- 9.    Page 8 B-421127.5; B -421127.6   \nHere, the record shows that the agency considered the contents of each proposal and documented its evaluation.  In this regard, the agency\u2019s post -protest conclusions are \nreasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  The protester is incorrect that  the \nagency failed to document its evaluation simply because it utilized a methodology of documenting only the portions of proposals that exceeded or failed to meet requirements and making no notations on portions that met requirements.  As a result, the protester has not shown that the agency failed to document its findings.  Konica Minolta Bus. Sols. USA, Inc. , B-418800, B -418800.2, Sep. 4, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 292 at \n6 n.4 (explaining that the agency\u2019s choice not to document all determinations of adequacy did not render the evaluation unreasonable or inadequately documented).   \nIn addition, we are not persuaded by the protester\u2019s argument that the agency should have considered Cognito\u2019s past performance information as part of its technical evaluation.  The RFP did not require such consideration, and the protester does not identif y any portion of the RFP that supports its argument.   \n Evaluation of KSHS\u2019s Proposal  \n KSHS argues that the agency should have assigned its management and staffing approach volume six additional strengths.  We have reviewed all KSHS\u2019s arguments and find that it has not demonstrated that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretio n not to assign additional strengths.  We address three examples below.    \n KSHS first asserts that its proposal should have been assigned a strength for its \u201cunparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its \nexperienced [human performance] program manager.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 14.  The agency responds that KSHS already received a strength for its experience, and there was no reason to assign an additional strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1.  The protester counters that the agency did not address its program manager\u2019s \nexperience specifi cally, which merited a strength by itself, and therefore the agency has \nconceded this issue.  Supp. Comments at 14.   \n We are not persuaded.  The agency\u2019s response addressed KSHS\u2019s experience as the incumbent contractor, which would extend to its program manager\u2019s experience.  Compare Comments & Supp. Protest at 9 (asserting that the protester\u2019s proposal \nexceeded requirements with \u201cunparalleled experience with the required work structure, including utilizing its experienced [human performance] program manager\u201d) with  AR, \nTab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 1 (stating that \u201cKSHS was provided a strength for experience. This proposal feature addresses incumbency and experience . . . on the previous SMIP contract.  No additional strength was distinguished in this proposed feature.\u201d).    Second, the protester\u2019s argument rests on a misunderstanding of the standard we apply when determining whether an agency reasonably exercised its discretion not to assign a strength.  The protester implies that because its experience exceeded the requirements, it is necessarily entitled to a strength.  This is incorrect.  A n agency \u2019s judgment of  Page 9 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  whether to assess unique strengths is a matter within the agency \u2019s discretion and one \nthat we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the evaluation \nwas unreasonable.   APC Constr., LLC, B -419771, July 13, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 258 at 8.  \nIt is up to the agency to determine whether an offering, even one that exceeds the requirements, merits a strength so long as the agency\u2019s decision has a reasonable basis.  The protester does not challenge t he agency\u2019s assertion that its experience was \nalready accounted for and neither does the protester demonstrate how the agency\u2019s decision not to assign a strength was unreasonable.  As a result, the protester\u2019s argument amounts to disagreement with the agency\u2019s decision which does not provide a basis  to sustain the protest.  APC, supra  at 10; The Ginn Group., Inc. , B-420165, \nB-420165.2, Dec. 22, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 17 at 9.   \n KSHS next asserts that it should have received a strength for proposing an \u201cuninterrupted transition in 15 days or less\u201d at the start of contract performance.  Supp. Comments at 15.  The agency responds that this offering did not merit a strength because t he awardee is required to commence performance on the performance start \ndate, and the agency viewed this offering as KSHS simply affirming that it would meet the requirement.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  The protester responds that its transition timeline is nevertheless clearly a benefit to the agency.  Supp. Comments at 15.  KSHS has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  The firm\u2019s response that this offering is a benefit does not demonstrate that the agency has been unreasonable, but simply expresses disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, which as stated above, does not provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  The Ginn Group , supra.  As a result, we deny this protest allegation.   \n \nFinally, KSHS asserts that it should have been assigned a strength for its compensation and comprehensive benefits package because its package identifies specific benefits that provide \u201can edge in hiring.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 16.  The agency responds that t his \nfeature in the KSHS proposal does not warrant a strength because it does not exceed the RFP\u2019s requirements or add value.  The agency explains that developing appropriate compensation and benefit packages to retain the workforce is the responsibility of  an \nemployer, and KSHS\u2019s offering meets the requirements but does not merit a strength.  AR, Tab 28, TET Chair Declaration at 3.  KSHS responds that its packages did merit a strength because its specific offerings provide KSHS a competitive edge.  Supp. Comments at 16.   \n While KSHS argues that these offerings provide it a competitive edge, KSHS has failed to show that the agency unreasonably failed to assign its proposal a strength in this area.  The RFP stated several times that offerors were to describe approaches that  \n       Page 10 B-421127.5; B -421127.6  demonstrated how they would retain talented staff and mitigate competition from other \nfirms for staff, RFP amend. 0005 at 15, 19.  The agency argues that the protester\u2019s proposal met the RFP\u2019s requirements and KSHS has not otherwise asserted or established  that its offering exceeds these requirements.  As a result, the protester has \nprovided no basis to find that the agency was unreasonable in exercising its discretion not to assign KSHS\u2019s proposal a strength.\n 2  \n The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n2 KSHS asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the alleged flaws \nin the evaluation.  Where other challenges to an evaluation of quotations have been denied or otherwise dismissed, a challenge to the best -value determination based on \nthose allegations does not afford a basis to sustain the protest.

Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 2; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1.  To become qualified, a manufacturer \nmust notify the agency that it wishes to submit an LTFR product for evaluation.  Protest at 4.  The manufacturer\u2019s product must then satisfy a laboratory evaluation consisting of multiple tests, including uniform corrosion, mammalian toxicity and irritation, combustion -retarding effectiveness, physical properties, materials effects, pumpability, DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.

Id.  at 4-5; see also Agency Report (AR), Tab 2, \nLTFR Specification, at  17-23.   \n \nBased on the results of the laboratory testing, the agency may determine that the product is \u201cfully qualified\u201d or \u201cconditionally qualified.\u201d  MOL at 3.  \u201cConditionally Qualified\u201d products require an operational field evaluation (OFE).  Id.; see also AR, \nTab 3, OFE Description at 2.  The scope of an OFE will vary depending on the product.  \nAR, Tab 3, OFE Description at 2 (\u201cThe [OFE] may vary from a slight increase in sampling, to a detailed complex evaluation.\u201d).  At a minimum, the OFE will use 200,000 gallons of LTFR.  Id.  If the product passes the OFE, then it will be considered \u201cfully \nqualified\u201d and added to the qualified products list (QPL).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specification at 17.   \n Perimeter currently is the sole supplier of LTFR and ancillary services to the Forest Service under an existing contract.  Protest at 5.  Perimeter states that its contract provides it with the exclusive right to provide LTFR to the Forest Service, except that the government may purchase 200,000 gallons of a \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d LTFR for field testing.  Id.  Perimeter also explains that its contract provides that the government may \nonly compensate another manufacturer for a \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d pr oduct at the \nsame rate it pays to Perimeter.  Id.    \n Fortress is a subsidiary of Compass Minerals and is a relatively new manufacturer of LTFR products.  COS at 3.  In 2022, Fortress obtained full qualification for two products; \nhowever, one of Fortress\u2019s products caused significant corrosion for two government \naircraft and the agency subsequently removed both products from the QPL.

As a result, the agency also revised the specification for any LTFR to require \nthat any product use only one or a combination of retarding salts ( i.e., diammonium \nphosphate, monoammonium phosphate, or ammonium polyphosphate).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specificat ion at 33.  \n Fortress subsequently sought to qualify another LTFR product, Qela.  AR, Tab 4, Letter from Agency to Fortress at 1.  In September 2024, the agency reviewed the results of Qela\u2019s laboratory evaluation and determined that the product satisfied all the speci fication requirements except for corrosion to magnesium coupons ( i.e., metal \nsamples).  Id. at 1-2.  In November 2024, the agency determined that the product was \n\u201cconditionally qualified,\u201d but that an OFE would need to be conducted to ensure that the product does not accelerate corrosion of government aircraft.  AR, Tab 7, Internal \nCorrespondence at 1; see also AR, Tab 8, Letter from Agency to Fortress at 1.  On \nDecember 5, the Forest Service officially added Qela to the QPL as \u201cconditionally qualified.\u201d  COS at 8.   \n On January 29, 2025, the Forest Service issued a notice that it intended to award a requirements contract for Qela and ancillary support services to Compass Minerals.  AR, Tab 11, Notice of Intent to Award a Sole- Source Contract at 2.  The notice \nexplained that only one responsible source offered Qela and cited 41 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3304(a)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  section 6.302- 1,  Page 3 B-423321; B -423321.2  as its authority for issuing the contract on a sole- source basis.  Id.  at 2-3.  The notice \nalso provided that any LTFR producers could submit a capabilities statement, proposal, \nor quotation within 15 days ( i.e., by February 13).  Id. at 3.   \n In the accompanying \u201cJustification for Other than Full and Open Competition\u201d (JOFC) document, the Forest Service explained the following:  \n \nNo other contractor has completed the predecessor steps in the QPL process to become conditionally qualified and eligible for an [official field evaluation (OFE)] and therefore the Contractor is the only supplier that meets the authorities specified herein.  \n AR, Tab 9, JOFC at 2.  The JOFC also provided that the agency would order 900,000 gallons of Qela, including 200,000 gallons for regular testing and the other 700,000 gallons for additional testing to ensure that the product can be comingled with other LTFR products and will not accelerate the corrosion of government aircraft.  Id.  at 1-2. \nAdditionally, the JOFC explained that the contract had an estimated value of $13 million and that the agency will use cost analysis techniques to ensure that the price is  fair and \nreasonable.  Id. at 1. \n On February 7, Perimeter filed this protest with our Office.  \n DISCUSSION  Perimeter raises multiple allegations challenging the agency\u2019s use of non- competitive \nprocedures.  Principally, Perimeter argues that the agency unreasonably seeks to procure 700,000 gallons for additional testing.  Perimeter also argues that the agency will unreasonably procure ancillary services.  Additionally, the protester contends that the agency failed to consider its alternate product.  Finally, Perimeter asserts that the sole-source award will create an unfair competitive advantage for Fortress.  \n While presenting arguments countering the merits of protester\u2019s allegations, the Forest Service also argues that Perimeter is not an interested party to raise its challenges.  We agree with the agency that the firm does not demonstrate the requisite interest and therefore dismiss the protest without addressing the underlying merits.  \n The agency argues that Perimeter is not an interested party because the firm does not manufacture Qela.  MOL at 11- 14.  The agency explains that it needs to test Qela to \ndetermine whether the product may be considered \u201cfully qualified.\u201d   Id.  12.  Thus, since \nPerimeter manufactures a competitor product, the Forest Service asserts that Perimeter is not an interested party because it cannot satisfy the agency\u2019s need.  Id. \n Perimeter counters that the firm is an interested party because it also possesses a \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d product eligible for an OFE.  Comments at 33; Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 10.  It argues that the agency plans to test only one product this season, and should the agency elect to test Fortress\u2019s product, then it will lose the opportunity to  Page 4 B-423321; B -423321.2  have its product tested.  Perimeter also argues that the agency fabricated the testing \nrequirement to render the firm not an interested party.  Supp. Comments at 4.   \n During the development of this protest, we sought additional information regarding Perimeter\u2019s product to aid in our determination of whether the firm was an interested party.  Specifically, we inquired:  \n \nGAO requests that the agency provide additional information concerning whether Perimeter is an interested party.  In so doing, GAO requests that the agency explain whether Perimeter does, in fact, have a \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d product.  GAO would apprec iate the agency providing additional \ndetails explaining why Perimeter\u2019s product is \u201cnot ready, slated, or planned for an OFE anytime soon.\u201d  [COS at 19].  The agency should also explain the difference between Perimeter\u2019s and Fortress\u2019s products.  Finally, GAO would appreciate the agency clarifying how the products are different in terms of where they are in the qualification process.  \n GAO Second Req. for Additional Briefing at 1- 2.   \n In response, the agency explained that it notified Perimeter that one of its products was conditionally qualified in November 2024.

However, the agency explains that it is currently revisi ng its \ntesting requirements ( i.e., specification) to include additional galvanic corrosion testing.\n1  \nSupp. COS at 2- 3. The agency explains that \u201c[r]ecent work showed that adopting a \ngalvanic corrosion test will help screen products that would otherwise meet current \ncorrosion test criteria.\u201d  Id.

Supp. COS at 2.  As a result, the agency asserts that Perimeter is not an interested party because it does not have a competitor product ready for field evaluation.  See id.  at 4; \nsee also MOL at 16.  \n \nThe protester responds that it is an interested party because its competitor product \nsatisfied required testing and was previously determined to be \u201cconditionally qualified.\u201d  \nResp. to Supp. COS at 3.  Additionally, Perimeter asserts that the galvanic test ing will \nbe completed soon and that, therefore, the firm still has an eligible product for this \nyear\u2019s fire -season.

Even if we concluded that the agency unreasonably restricted competition, Perimeter would not be positioned to compete for an award.\n  Our review of the record shows that Fortress\u2019s product has \ncompleted the new galvanic corrosion test while Perimeter\u2019s relevant products have not.\n2  While Perimeter may argue that one of its products is \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d \nbecause it received a letter notifying the firm to that effect, we note that the determination of whether Perimeter\u2019s product is ready for a field evaluation is a discretiona ry matter reserved to the agency; in this regard, the Forest Service has \nexplained that Perimeter\u2019s product must undergo the galvanic corrosion test and that it will issue a new letter communicating this fact.  Supp. COS at 3; s ee Automated Power \nSys., Inc., B -224203, Feb.  4, 1987, 87- 1 CPD \u00b6 109 at 3 (explaining that whether a \nproduct needs to be retested for inclusion on a qualified products list is a discretionary matter which we will not object to absent a showing that the determination lacked a reasonable basis).

Supp. COS at 2. \nThe agency explains that one of the products will complete the galvanic corrosion testing in mid- May 2025 and the other product by June or July 2025.  Id. \nPerimeter argues that it is an interested party because one of its products will complete the testing requirement in the next few weeks.  We are unpersuaded.  First, we determine whether a party is interested based on the current record, which, as noted above, shows that Perimeter\u2019s product has not yet satisfied the new galvanic corrosion testing requirement.  Second, an agency need not forgo meeting current needs solely based on the prospect of enhanced future competition where it has an undisputed need involving a matter of public safety.

The agency has reasonably explained that the new test is necessary to ensure that any LTFR products do not accelerate corrosion, as well as maintain a fair qualifications process.  The record also shows that the agency started revising its \nspecification to include the additional testing requirement as early as November 2024.  AR, Tab 7, Internal Agency Memorandum at 1 (explaining that the agency\u2019s National Technology and Development Program (NTDP) \u201cis currently working [Fire and Aviation Management] and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to update [the specification] to include additional laboratory testing that would identify revisions and the addition of other corrosion tests to reduce or eliminate the corrosion concerns\u201d).   \n Moreover, Perimeter\u2019s product simply does not fulfill the agency\u2019s need.  The agency explains, and our review of the record confirms, that it needs to determine whether Qela is a viable LTFR product.  Testing Perimeter\u2019s product simply has no bearing on determining whether Qela is viable.  In any event, the agency explains that it will likely acquire any amount of Perimeter\u2019s product needed for testing through a sole- source \nacquisition as well.

The scope of an OFE will vary depending on the product.  \nAR, Tab 3, OFE Description at 2 (\u201cThe [OFE] may vary from a slight increase in sampling, to a detailed complex evaluation.\u201d).  At a minimum, the OFE will use 200,000 gallons of LTFR.  Id.  If the product passes the OFE, then it will be considered \u201cfully \nqualified\u201d and added to the qualified products list (QPL).  AR, Tab 2, LTFR Specification at 17.   \n Perimeter currently is the sole supplier of LTFR and ancillary services to the Forest Service under an existing contract.  Protest at 5.  Perimeter states that its contract provides it with the exclusive right to provide LTFR to the Forest Service, except that the government may purchase 200,000 gallons of a \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d LTFR for field testing.  Id.  Perimeter also explains that its contract provides that the government may \nonly compensate another manufacturer for a \u201cconditionally qualified\u201d pr oduct at the \nsame rate it pays to Perimeter.  Id.    \n Fortress is a subsidiary of Compass Minerals and is a relatively new manufacturer of LTFR products.  COS at 3.

Perimeter also argues that the agency will unreasonably procure ancillary services.  Additionally, the protester contends that the agency failed to consider its alternate product.  Finally, Perimeter asserts that the sole-source award will create an unfair competitive advantage for Fortress.  \n While presenting arguments countering the merits of protester\u2019s allegations, the Forest Service also argues that Perimeter is not an interested party to raise its challenges.  We agree with the agency that the firm does not demonstrate the requisite interest and therefore dismiss the protest without addressing the underlying merits.  \n The agency argues that Perimeter is not an interested party because the firm does not manufacture Qela.

        "Summary":"Protester is not an interested party to challenge the issuance of a task order against a General Services Administration schedule contract when the protester does not hold a schedule contract for the commercial cloud services sought by the agency.  \nDECISION  \n Manhattan Telecommunications Corporation, LLC  (MetTel), a small business of New \nYork, New York, protests the actions of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in \nprocuring telecommunications services, including toll -free telephone numbers.  MetTel, \na contractor currently providing telecommunication services to SSA, contends that SSA improperly issued a sole- source task order for such services without notice or \njustification in violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  MetTel also argues \nthat the agency improperly terminated the task order under which the protester provides \ntelecommunications services to SSA.  \n We dismiss the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n MetTel currently provides telecommunications services, including toll -free services, to \nSSA pursuant to task order No. 28321320FDX030010, issued under the General Services Administration  (GSA) Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions  (EIS) schedule DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO protective order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2 B-423414; B -423414.2  contract.1  Agency Report  (AR), Exh. 9, Grand SLLAM (SSA\u2019s Local and Long distance \nAccess Management) Task Order at  1, 36.2  The task order, issued on February 4, \n2020, and referred to as the Grand SLLAM task order, was the result of SSA\u2019s \nconsolidation of telephony services contract vehicles and locally purchased services into a single EIS task order.  Id. at 36.  The task order has a base period of 1- year and \nup to 12 option years; the most recent option year is set to end on February  3, 2026.  Id. \nat 9-10.   \n As relevant to this protest, under the Grand SLLAM task order, SSA pays MetTel  for the \nagency\u2019s actual use of toll -free services and is not required to obtain the services \nexclusively from MetTel.  Id. at 17-35, 98- 99; see also Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement \nand Memorandum of Law  (COS\/MOL) at 6.  On March 21, 2025, MetTel contacted the \nagency and noted that it had just been informed that \u201call Toll -Free services are moving \naway from MetTel and are moving to [Amazon Web Services  (AWS)].\u201d  Protest exh. A, \nEmails Between Protester and Agency, Mar. 21- 25, 2025 at 3 (quoting protester\u2019s \nrequest to meet with the agency to discuss service changes); see also Protest at 3- 4.  \nAlthough MetTel pressed SSA for more information about the change, none was forthcoming.  \n On March 25, MetTel filed a protest with our Office complaining that SSA had partially cancelled its contract to provide toll -free services and made a sole- source award to \nAWS without publicizing or justifying its decision.  Protest at  4-6.  During development of \nthe protest, SSA advised that it is currently obtaining the required toll -free services \nthrough an existing blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) for AWS cloud computing \nservices with Four Points Technology LLC  (Four Points).  First Req. for Dismissal, \nApr. 4, 2025 at 2.  SSA explained that it established BPA No.  28321321A00040003 with \nFour Points on December  22, 2020, to provide the agency with access to \u201ccommercial \ncloud service providers  (CSP) to support the development and delivery of business \nservices to the public and SSA technicians,\u201d including AWS.

SSA established the BPA against Four \nPoints\u2019s  GSA schedule contract for, as relevant here, special item number 518210C, \ncloud and cloud- related IT professional services.  AR, Exh.  4, Four Points GSA \nSchedule at  1, 4; see also Second Req. for Dismissal at  6-7; COS\/MOL at 4.  On \nAugust 1, 2024, the agency issued task order No.  28321324FA0010214 under the BPA \nto Four Points for \u201cContact Center as a Service (CCaaS), Amazon Web Services  (AWS) \nConnect;\u201d the task order has a one 1- year base period and a one 1- year option period.  \nAR, Exh. 3, Four Points Task  Order at 1 -2.   \n \n1 The EIS schedule contract is a multiple award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity \n(IDIQ) contract to provide agencies with \u201cthe next -generation of information \ntechnology  (IT), telecommunications and infrastructure services.\u201d  AR, Exhibit 10, GSA \neLibrary EIS Summary at 1.   \n2 Citations to the record use the Adobe PDF pagination of the documents produced.

As relevant \nto this protest, Amazon Connect has telephony capabilities that include providing local, \nlong distance, and toll -free telephone numbers and service.   See id.  at 7-10.  After \nlearning that the agency had issued a task order for the Amazon Connect services  to \nFour Points, MetTel filed a supplemental protest.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nMetTel raises multiple arguments concerning SSA \u2019s acquisition of its required toll -free \nservices.  Initially, MetTel argues that the agency had partially cancelled its contract to \nprovide toll -free service and made a sole- source award to AWS without publicizing or \njustifying its decision.  Protest at  4-6.  After the agency clarified that it had issued a task \norder to Four Points, not AWS, MetTel further argues that SSA improperly issued the task order to Four Points because the Amazon Connect services exceed the scope of Four Points\u2019s GSA schedule contract for cloud computing and Four Points is ineligible to provide toll -free services because it is not a registered provider in accordance with \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations .  Supp. Protest at  4-5.   \n The agency requests that our Office dismiss all of MetTel\u2019s initial protest grounds, arguing that they are legally insufficient and involve matters of contract administration over which GAO does not exercise jurisdiction.  First Req. for Dismissal at  4-7.  SSA \nalso argues that we should dismiss MetTel\u2019s supplemental protest on the basis that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points and that MetTel raises matters of contract administration.  Second Req. for Dismissal at  3-4, \n9-10; COS\/MOL at 9- 10.  W e dismiss the protest grounds as discussed below.\n4 \n Contract Administration  \n We first address MetTel\u2019s allegations that the SSA has improperly cancelled portions of its contract to provide telecommunications services, including toll -free services.  Protest \nat 4-6.  In its request for dismissal, the agency argues that MetTel\u2019s compl aint about the \nreduction in MetTel\u2019s services is \u201ca pure contract administration matter\u201d over which GAO \n \n3 Throughout the record the terms \u201cAWS Connect\u201d and \u201cAmazon Connect\u201d are used \ninterchangeably when discussing the AWS product for a CCaaS, which is a virtual contact center.  See AR, Exh. 7, AWS Amazon Connect Documentation Website at  1. \n4 While we do not address every argument raised in this protest , we have reviewed \neach issue and do not find any basis to sustain the protest.   The agency also raises \nadditional grounds for dismissal of the protest.  Because we agree with the agency that \nthe protester is not an interested party to challenge Four Points\u2019s task order award, we \nneed not resolve the alternative asserted bases for dismissal.   Page 4 B-423414; B -423414.2  has no jurisdiction.  First Req. for Dismissal at 7.  We agree with the agency and \ndismiss these protest allegations on that basis.   \n Our Office considers bid protest challenges to the award or proposed award of contracts.  31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552.  We generally do not review matters of contract administration, which are within the discretion of the contracting agency and for review by a cogniz ant board of contract appeals or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.5(a); AeroSage, LLC , B-416429 et al. , July 25, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 252 at 4.  As \none of a few exceptions to this rule, w e will, however, review the propriety of a contract \ntermi nation where it flows from a defect that the contracting agency perceived in the \naward process.  In such cases, we examine the award procedures that underlie the termination action for the limited purpose of determining whether the initial award was improper and, if so, whether the corrective action taken is proper.  American Material Handling, Inc. , B-406739, Aug.  14, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  234 at 3; see also Service \nConnected, Inc. , B\u2011416324, June 11, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 208 at 6 (delineating the limited \nsituations where GAO reviews protest grounds challenging contract termination).  \n This exception is inapplicable here.  The record shows that SSA pays for the toll -free \nservices used under the Grand SLLAM task order contract with MetTel.  AR, Exh . 9, \nGrand SLLAM Task Order at  17-35; 98- 99; see also COS\/MOL at  9-10.  SSA is not \nobligated to use the contract with MetTel as the only means of obtaining the toll -free \nservices it needs.  Moreover, MetTel has not alleged SSA decreased its usage of toll -\nfree services because of a perceived defect with the award of the initial Grand SLLAM task or der to MetTel.  Accordingly, any reduction of MetTel\u2019s toll -free services is a \nmatter of contract administration and we dismiss this protest ground because it raises \nan issue GAO will not consider.    Insufficient Protest Allegations  \n Next, the protester argues that the agency improperly awarded a sole- source contract to \nAWS for toll -free services in violation of FAR parts 5 and 6, which require publication of \ncontract actions and documented justification for a non- competitive award, respectively.  \nProtest at  4-6.  In response, SSA requests dismissal of the protest because MetTel is \nmistaken about the contract vehicle the agency is using to procure the toll -free services.  \nIn this connection, the agency advises that in August 2024, it is sued a task order to \nFour Points, not AWS, for Amazon Connect, a cloud computing service, under an existing BPA established with Four Points for access to commercial cloud computing services.  First Req. for Dismissal at  2, 4-6.  The agency argues that Met Tel\u2019s protest \ngrounds do not state a valid basis for protest because they are based on an incorrect contract awardee and are therefore legally and factually insufficient.  Id. at 4-6.  We \nagree.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations require a protester to include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.1(c)(4), (f).  That is, a protest must include sufficient f actual \nbases to establish a reasonable potential that the protester\u2019s allegations may have  Page 5 B-423414; B -423414.2  merit.  Chags Health Info. Tech., LLC , B-420940.3 et al. , Dec. 14, 2022, 2022 CPD \n\u00b6 315 at 5.  Where a protester\u2019s allegations are based on speculation, factual \ninaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions, GAO will summarily dismiss the protest \nwithout requiring the agency to submit a report.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5; Excelsior Ambulance Serv., Inc ., B-421948, Sept.  27, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 220 at 3.  \n The record demonstrates that MetTel\u2019s protest was based on faulty facts and a flawed legal assumption.  SSA established a BPA with Four Points in December 2020 for access to commercial cloud computing services.  In August 2024, pursuant to the BPA, the agency issued a task order to Four Points for Amazon Connect, a CCaaS that includes providing toll -free services to the agency.  SSA did not make a sole- source \naward to AWS for toll -free services.  Because this protest ground is based on inaccurate \nfactual as sertions, we dismiss it as failing to state a valid basis for protest.  \n Interested Party  \n MetTel  also challenges SSA\u2019s issuance of the task order to Four Points and asserts that \nthe toll -free services are outside the scope of Four Points\u2019s GSA schedule contract.  \nSpecifically, MetTel argues that Four Points\u2019s GSA schedule contract allows it \u201cto resel l \nspecific IT hardware and software licenses and services to the federal government,\u201d but that the specified items do not include the toll -free services that MetTel provides to SSA.  \nSupp. Protest at 3- 5.  The protester also argues that SSA\u2019s contract with Four Points \nviolates FCC regulations because operators of toll -free services are required to be \nregistered with the FCC and Four Points is not.  Id.   \n \nThe agency requests dismissal of this protest ground, arguing that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points because MetTel is not \u201can actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.\u201d  Second Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4 (quoting the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7  3551(2) ).   \n The agency contends that MetTel  has not alleged it competed for the BPA established \nwith Four Points in 2020 or that MetTel was even eligible to compete for the BPA.  Id. at 3.  In this connection, SSA contends that the protester would be ineligible for award if \nits protest were to be sustained because MetTel does not have a GSA schedule contract that includes access to AWS commercial cloud computing services, including Amazon Connect.  Id. at 4.  The agency contends that the protester cannot show that \nthe agency\u2019s award of the task order to Four Points directly affects the protester\u2019s economic interest, and therefore, the protester is not an interested party.  Id.  \n In response, the protester concedes that it did not participate in the BPA competition and that it does not have a GSA schedule contract for access to commercial cloud computing services.  Comments at 12- 13.  MetTel nonetheless argues that it has an \neconom ic interest because SSA\u2019s use of MetTel\u2019s services has decreased as a result of \nthe agency\u2019s task order award to Four Points.  Id.  Page 6 B-423414; B -423414.2   \nUnder the bid protest provisions of CICA, only an \u201cinterested party\u201d may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. \u00a7  3551(2) ; 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.0(a).  That is, a protester must \nbe an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.0(a).  Determining whether a party is interested involves consideration of a variety of factors, including the nature of the issues raised, the benefit or relief sought by the protester, and the party\u2019s status in relation to the procurement.  Four Winds Servs ., Inc. , \nB-280714, Aug. 28, 1998, 98- 2 CPD \u00b6 57 at 2.  A protester is not an interested party \nwhere it would not be eligible to receive a contract award were its protest to be sustained, including, for example, where it does not have a GSA schedule contract that includes the services sought by the agency.  See  C3.ai , B-421337, B -421337.2, \nFeb. 16, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 57 at 5; FitNet Purchasing Alliance, B -406075, Feb. 3, \n2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 64 at 3.  \n On this record, we find that the protester has not shown, or even alleged, that it is a prospective offeror eligible to compete for a task order for the Amazon Connect services sought by the agency.  We also find that MetTel\u2019s economic interest in the proc urement \nis too remote.  In this connection, MetTel argues it has a direct economic interest in the procurement because the agency is using less of its services due to the Four Points task order.  While the volume of services that the agency orders under it s existing task \norder with MetTel may be impacted by SSA\u2019s issuance of the task order to Four Points, this is not the kind of direct economic interest contemplated by our Bid Protest Regulations.  See Intellectix Corp. , B-420552 et al. , May 27, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6  135 at 6 \n(concluding protester \u2019s economic interest is too remote for the firm to be considered an \ninterested party to challenge the agency\u2019s task order award when the protester does not \nhold the requisite schedule contract) .  MetTel has admitted it does not have a GSA \nschedule contract for cloud computing services (special item number 518210C) and it is incapable of providing SSA with the Amazon Connect services required so SSA is unable to issue a task order to MetTel for the requirement.  Because MetTel would not be eligible for contract award even if its protest is sustained, we conclude that MetTel is not an interested party to pursue a protest of SSA\u2019s issuance of a task order to Four Points.

As \none of a few exceptions to this rule, w e will, however, review the propriety of a contract \ntermi nation where it flows from a defect that the contracting agency perceived in the \naward process.  In such cases, we examine the award procedures that underlie the termination action for the limited purpose of determining whether the initial award was improper and, if so, whether the corrective action taken is proper.

The record shows that SSA pays for the toll -free \nservices used under the Grand SLLAM task order contract with MetTel.  AR, Exh . 9, \nGrand SLLAM Task Order at  17-35; 98- 99; see also COS\/MOL at  9-10.  SSA is not \nobligated to use the contract with MetTel as the only means of obtaining the toll -free \nservices it needs.  Moreover, MetTel has not alleged SSA decreased its usage of toll -\nfree services because of a perceived defect with the award of the initial Grand SLLAM task or der to MetTel.  Accordingly, any reduction of MetTel\u2019s toll -free services is a \nmatter of contract administration and we dismiss this protest ground because it raises \nan issue GAO will not consider.    Insufficient Protest Allegations  \n Next, the protester argues that the agency improperly awarded a sole- source contract to \nAWS for toll -free services in violation of FAR parts 5 and 6, which require publication of \ncontract actions and documented justification for a non- competitive award, respectively.  \nProtest at  4-6.  In response, SSA requests dismissal of the protest because MetTel is \nmistaken about the contract vehicle the agency is using to procure the toll -free services.  \nIn this connection, the agency advises that in August 2024, it is sued a task order to \nFour Points, not AWS, for Amazon Connect, a cloud computing service, under an existing BPA established with Four Points for access to commercial cloud computing services.  First Req. for Dismissal at  2, 4-6.  The agency argues that Met Tel\u2019s protest \ngrounds do not state a valid basis for protest because they are based on an incorrect contract awardee and are therefore legally and factually insufficient.

Where a protester\u2019s allegations are based on speculation, factual \ninaccuracies, or flawed legal assumptions, GAO will summarily dismiss the protest \nwithout requiring the agency to submit a report.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5; Excelsior Ambulance Serv., Inc ., B-421948, Sept.  27, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 220 at 3.  \n The record demonstrates that MetTel\u2019s protest was based on faulty facts and a flawed legal assumption.  SSA established a BPA with Four Points in December 2020 for access to commercial cloud computing services.  In August 2024, pursuant to the BPA, the agency issued a task order to Four Points for Amazon Connect, a CCaaS that includes providing toll -free services to the agency.  SSA did not make a sole- source \naward to AWS for toll -free services.  Because this protest ground is based on inaccurate \nfactual as sertions, we dismiss it as failing to state a valid basis for protest.  \n Interested Party  \n MetTel  also challenges SSA\u2019s issuance of the task order to Four Points and asserts that \nthe toll -free services are outside the scope of Four Points\u2019s GSA schedule contract.  \nSpecifically, MetTel argues that Four Points\u2019s GSA schedule contract allows it \u201cto resel l \nspecific IT hardware and software licenses and services to the federal government,\u201d but that the specified items do not include the toll -free services that MetTel provides to SSA.  \nSupp. Protest at 3- 5.  The protester also argues that SSA\u2019s contract with Four Points \nviolates FCC regulations because operators of toll -free services are required to be \nregistered with the FCC and Four Points is not.  Id.   \n \nThe agency requests dismissal of this protest ground, arguing that MetTel is not an interested party to challenge the task order issued to Four Points because MetTel is not \u201can actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.\u201d  Second Req. for Dismissal at 3 -4 (quoting the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7  3551(2) ).   \n The agency contends that MetTel  has not alleged it competed for the BPA established \nwith Four Points in 2020 or that MetTel was even eligible to compete for the BPA.  Id. at 3.  In this connection, SSA contends that the protester would be ineligible for award if \nits protest were to be sustained because MetTel does not have a GSA schedule contract that includes access to AWS commercial cloud computing services, including Amazon Connect.  Id. at 4.  The agency contends that the protester cannot show that \nthe agency\u2019s award of the task order to Four Points directly affects the protester\u2019s economic interest, and therefore, the protester is not an interested party.  Id.  \n In response, the protester concedes that it did not participate in the BPA competition and that it does not have a GSA schedule contract for access to commercial cloud computing services.  Comments at 12- 13.  MetTel nonetheless argues that it has an \neconom ic interest because SSA\u2019s use of MetTel\u2019s services has decreased as a result of \nthe agency\u2019s task order award to Four Points.  Id.  Page 6 B-423414; B -423414.2   \nUnder the bid protest provisions of CICA, only an \u201cinterested party\u201d may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. \u00a7  3551(2) ; 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.0(a).  That is, a protester must \nbe an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or the failure to award a contract.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.0(a).

We also find that MetTel\u2019s economic interest in the proc urement \nis too remote.  In this connection, MetTel argues it has a direct economic interest in the procurement because the agency is using less of its services due to the Four Points task order.  While the volume of services that the agency orders under it s existing task \norder with MetTel may be impacted by SSA\u2019s issuance of the task order to Four Points, this is not the kind of direct economic interest contemplated by our Bid Protest Regulations.  See Intellectix Corp. , B-420552 et al. , May 27, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6  135 at 6 \n(concluding protester \u2019s economic interest is too remote for the firm to be considered an \ninterested party to challenge the agency\u2019s task order award when the protester does not \nhold the requisite schedule contract) .  MetTel has admitted it does not have a GSA \nschedule contract for cloud computing services (special item number 518210C) and it is incapable of providing SSA with the Amazon Connect services required so SSA is unable to issue a task order to MetTel for the requirement.  Because MetTel would not be eligible for contract award even if its protest is sustained, we conclude that MetTel is not an interested party to pursue a protest of SSA\u2019s issuance of a task order to Four Points.

        "Summary":"1.  Protest alleging that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity  is denied where the \nprotester \u2019s interpretation of the relevant solicitation language is not reasonable.  \n 2.  Protest alleging that the agency should have waived the protester\u2019s quotation error \nas a minor informality is dismissed where the agency was not required to waive minor informalities under Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 8.4.  \nDECISION  \n FI Consulting, Inc. (FIC), a small business of Arlington, Virginia, protests the elimination of its quotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the \nDepartment of  Agriculture (USDA)  for program support to various USDA missions, \nincluding farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency improperly eliminated its  quotation based on ambiguous solicitation formatting \ninstructions and in the alternative, the agency should have waived the protester\u2019s failure to follow solicitation instructions as a minor informality.    \n We deny the protest in part and dismiss it in part.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through t he General Services \nAdministration\u2019s  electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the \nfederal supply schedule procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart \n8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Edh. 4.1, RFQ at 47-48 ; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject \nto a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release. \n \n  Page 2 B-423274  Compliance Review at 1.1  The solicitation contemplated the establishment of a multiple \naward, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year period of performance.  AR, \nExh. 6.1, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 1; RFQ at 48.   \n \nThe RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to \nevaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past \nperformance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach \nfactor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflict s of interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and \nrisk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal \nimportance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   \n Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  \n \nThe [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the \nGovernment can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  Therefore, \nthe [vendor] \u2019s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of spelling and \ngrammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the Government will \nexpect from awardees.  The [vendor] \u2019s ability to  follow the instructions contained \nherein is a demonstration of the [vendor] \u2019s ability to  follow instructions in general, \nwhich is paramount to acceptable performance.  \n The [vendor]\u2019 s attention to detail is important to the Government as a significant \namount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work statement] will \nrequire the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including quality control.  If a[] \n[vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not following the directions \ncontained herein, the [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] shall be ineligible for award.  \n Id. at 47.  \n The RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation stated that in the quotations, \u201c[i]llustrations may be placed as an imbedded picture, as long as the picture does not contain text.\u201d  Id. at 51.  The RFQ \nalso invited potential vendors to ask questions.  One vendor asked the agency to confirm that the instructions regarding illustrations and pictures without text \u201cdoes not pertain to the cover page\u201d because \u201c[c]over pages typically contain b randing elements \nfor companies including different fonts and pictures which may have text ( e.g., logos).\u201d  \nAR, Exh. 6.5, Questions and Answers (Q&A) at 9.  In response, the agency stated:  \u201cDo not include branding information as a picture if it includes text.  Instead include your company information in accordance with the solicitation instructions. \u201d  Id. \n \n \n1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274  The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the \nformatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  \n \n[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or deficient and will \nbe considered ineligible for award.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA quote will be deemed unacceptable if it does not . . . comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this solicitation.  \nRFQ. at 51, 64.  \n The solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  \n \nA deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of the \nRequest for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or unacceptable \nwithin this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  [vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is \ndetermined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s are cautioned to ensure all the \nsolicitation requirements are met.   [Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention \nto the details of this solicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] \u2019s ability to follow explicit \ninstructions is critical to the performance of the resulting orders from this \naward.  \n A quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .\u201d  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA failure to provide the information called for .  . .  or a failure to provide the \ninformation in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . .  The evaluation of a[n]  [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  will end upon a \ndetermination that  the [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  \n Id. at 63-64. \n The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s \nto determine whether quotations  were \u201ccompliant with the criteria and instructions of the \nRFQ,\u201d unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law \n(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 10.2, Notice of Elimination.     Page 4 B-423274  As part of its submission, FIC\u2019s quotation included its corporate logo on the cover page \nof each of its quotation volumes.  Protest at 3.  The corporate logo was a picture that spelled out \u201cFI CONSULTING.\u201d  Id.   After the initial compliance review of FIC\u2019s \nquotation, the agency determined that the quotation failed to comply with the RFQ\u2019s formatting instructions because FIC\u2019s \u201ccover pages contain images with text (Branding Images).\u201d  AR, Exh. 10.2, Notice of Eli mination.   The use of pictures with text was not \npermissible under the RFQ\u2019s instructions.  RFQ at 51.  Upon notification of its elimination, FIC filed this protest on January 9, 2025.   \n DISCUSSION  FIC asserts that the agency improperly excluded its quotation due to a latent  ambiguity \nin the solicitation\u2019s formatting instructions that prohibited the inclusion of text with pictures.  Protest at 4; Comments at 1.  The protester alleges that a reasonable \ninterpretation of the formatting instructions is that the prohibition did not apply to company logos.  Protest at 5.  In the alternative, protester argues that the agency was \nrequired under FAR section 14.405 to waive the error as a minor informality.  Id. at 6.  \nFor the reasons explained below, we find that the solicitation was not ambiguous and the agency reasonably eliminated the protester\u2019s quotation in accordance with the \nsolicitation\u2019s instructions.  \n Quotation Formatting Requirements  \n The protester does not dispute that its quotation included its corporate logo, which was a picture with text, but rather alleges that the solicitation instructions for pictures were \nlatently ambiguous.  Comments at 1.  Specifically, FIC explains that the formatting instructions that prohibit pictures with text did not apply to company logos because inclusion of its company name does not include text intended for \u201c[a]gency review as part of its evaluation\u201d  of FIC\u2019s quotation.  Protest at 5; Comments at 1.  I n this regard, \nthe protester explains that the solicitation instructions regarding \u201ctext\u201d in pictures are included with instructions for \u201cpage margins, font size, and line spacing.\u201d  Protest at 4.  The protester argues that the agency\u2019s intent was that vendors not use \u201cillustrations\u201d or \u201cpictures\u201d with text to \u201ccircumvent the [s]olicitation\u2019s instructions regarding margins, font size and line spacing.\u201d  Protest at 4; Comments at 2.  FIC contends that its interpretation of the formatting instructions should be accepted as \u201creasonable.\u201d  Protest at 5.    The agency contends it properly eliminated FIC\u2019s quotation because the protester included a picture with text on the cover page in \u201call four volumes\u201d and thus \u201cignored the solicitation requirement\u201d and the agency response as part of the Q&A process.\n2  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 4, AR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A.  The agency maintains \nthat the protester\u2019s \u201cinterpretation fails because based on the plain language of the RFQ \n \n2 The vendor Q&As were incorporated in the solicitation by amendment to ensure that \nsolicitation \u201crequirements were clear and that any ambiguities were resolved.\u201d  COS \nat 4; AR, Exh. 6.1, RFQ. amend. 0002.    Page 5 B-423274  instructions, as well as the agency response to the Q&A, it was not reasonable for FIC \nto assume that the RFQ requirements regarding text in images did not apply to an [vendor]\u2019s logo or that the RFQ requirement did not apply to cover pages.\u201d  MOL at 3.  \n Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation \nmust be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 163 at 5.  An \nambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the terms or specifica tions of the solicitation are possible.  The HP Grp., LLC , B-415285, Dec. 14, \n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 385 at 5.  A patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error, while a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.   Where \nthere is a latent ambiguity, both parties\u2019 interpretations of the provision may be reasonable, and the appropriate course of action is to clarify the requirement and afford offerors an opportunity to submit proposals based on the clarified requirement.  Qwes t \nGov\u2019t Servs., Inc . d\/b\/a CenturyLink QGS , B-419597, B -419597.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 217 at 5 n. 7. \n As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for pictures, specifically stating that \u201c . . . Illustrations may be placed as an imbedded picture, as long as the \npicture does not contain text .\u201d  RFQ at 51.   Moreover, the agency clarified formatting \nrequirements for pictures.  In response to a vendor\u2019s question regarding whether it was permissible to include company logos on quotation cover pages, the agency explained, \u201c[d]o not include branding information as a picture if it includes text.  Instead include \nyour company  information in accordance with the solicitation instructions .\u201d  COS at 4; \nAR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A at 9.  Stated otherwise, the solicitation instructions and agency \nresponse to the question both cautioned that pictures should not contain text.   \n On this record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity as alleged by the protester.  FIC\u2019s interpretation that company logos including text were exempt from the picture formatting requirements is incompatible with the solicitation instructions.  The protester \u2019s interpretation ignores the solicitation language, highlighted in bold font, that \nexplained that pictures should not contain text.  RFQ at 51.  To the extent this language did not make the agency\u2019s requirements plain, the agency\u2019s response, during the Q&A process, that \u201cbranding information\u201d should not include text if provided as a picture, foreclosed the protester\u2019s alternative interpretation.  AR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A at 9.  On these facts, we conclude that the protester's interpretation of the solicitation was not reasonable and that, therefore, no ambiguity exists.   \n Moreover, as explained above, t he RFQ included several sections which emphasized \nthat failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a \n\u201cdeficiency ,\u201d which mandated elimination from competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  In \nresponse to the protest, the agency explains that these instructions were intentionally included in bold font  to draw attention to these requirements.   COS at 4.  In this regard,  \nthe contracting officer states that the solicitation \u201cwas designed to select only thos e  Page 6 B-423274  contractors capable of following detailed instructions\u201d and that the RFQ \u201cstates the \nimportance of a [vendor\u2019s] ability to follow detailed instructions.\u201d  For these reasons, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d instead of discretionary terms such as \u201cmay\u201d which was an \u201cintentional and deliberate deviation\u201d from previous solicitations that was \u201cmade to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor\u2019s] \nability to follow directions.\u201d  Id. at 2.   \n On this record, we find FIC\u2019s interpretation of the RFQ to be unreasonable, and the agency\u2019s elimination of FIC\u2019s quotation to be reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Consequently, this protest ground is denied.  \n Waiver of Minor Informalities  \n In the alternative, the protester argues that the agency should have waived FIC\u2019s failure to follow solicitation instructions as a minor informality under FAR section 14.405.  Protest at 6.  The protester argues that including its company logo on the quotation cover pages did not permit FIC to have more space for quotation content than other vendors.  Id .  Furthermore, the \u201cdeviation\u201d was \u201cminor and immaterial,\u201d and inclusion of \nits quotation only serves to benefit the agency with increased competition.  I d.   \n In response, the agency argues that the \u201cability or inability to conform to the easy and clearly stated RFQ instruction is a material component of the RFQ to [en]sure that the [vendors] that received the award can deliver the quality of work that is expected under this BPA.\u201d  MOL at 4 -5.  Furthermore, the agency asserts that waiver of FIC\u2019s error is \ncontradictory to the RFQ\u2019s purpose and unfair to vendors who foll owed solicitation \ninstructions.  Id. at 5.     \n The protester has failed to allege a cognizable basis of protest because the protester\u2019s reliance on FAR section 14.405 is misplaced.\n3  Section 14.405 of the FAR applies to \nsealed bidding procedures under FAR part 14 and therefore is not applicable to the federal supply schedule procedures used here under FAR subpart 8.4.  As such, the protester\u2019s contention that the agency was required to ignore or waive the minor and immaterial errors fails to state adequate legal grounds of protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.5(f); \nsee Inalab Consulting, Inc. , B-418950, Oct.  9, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  327 at 6 (finding that \nthe decision to waive a solicitation requirement, even when permissible, is a  \n \n3 Our Bid Protest Regulations,  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7  21.1(c)(4) and (f) , require that a protest \ninclude a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.

Protest alleging that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity  is denied where the \nprotester \u2019s interpretation of the relevant solicitation language is not reasonable.  \n 2.  Protest alleging that the agency should have waived the protester\u2019s quotation error \nas a minor informality is dismissed where the agency was not required to waive minor informalities under Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 8.4.  \nDECISION  \n FI Consulting, Inc. (FIC), a small business of Arlington, Virginia, protests the elimination of its quotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the \nDepartment of  Agriculture (USDA)  for program support to various USDA missions, \nincluding farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency improperly eliminated its  quotation based on ambiguous solicitation formatting \ninstructions and in the alternative, the agency should have waived the protester\u2019s failure to follow solicitation instructions as a minor informality.    \n We deny the protest in part and dismiss it in part.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through t he General Services \nAdministration\u2019s  electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the \nfederal supply schedule procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart \n8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Edh. 4.1, RFQ at 47-48 ; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject \nto a GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release. \n \n  Page 2 B-423274  Compliance Review at 1.1  The solicitation contemplated the establishment of a multiple \naward, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year period of performance.  AR, \nExh. 6.1, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 1; RFQ at 48.   \n \nThe RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to \nevaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past \nperformance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach \nfactor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflict s of interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and \nrisk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal \nimportance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   \n Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  \n \nThe [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the \nGovernment can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  Therefore, \nthe [vendor] \u2019s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of spelling and \ngrammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the Government will \nexpect from awardees.  The [vendor] \u2019s ability to  follow the instructions contained \nherein is a demonstration of the [vendor] \u2019s ability to  follow instructions in general, \nwhich is paramount to acceptable performance.  \n The [vendor]\u2019 s attention to detail is important to the Government as a significant \namount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work statement] will \nrequire the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including quality control.  If a[] \n[vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not following the directions \ncontained herein, the [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] shall be ineligible for award.  \n Id. at 47.  \n The RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation stated that in the quotations, \u201c[i]llustrations may be placed as an imbedded picture, as long as the picture does not contain text.\u201d  Id. at 51.  The RFQ \nalso invited potential vendors to ask questions.  One vendor asked the agency to confirm that the instructions regarding illustrations and pictures without text \u201cdoes not pertain to the cover page\u201d because \u201c[c]over pages typically contain b randing elements \nfor companies including different fonts and pictures which may have text ( e.g., logos).\u201d  \nAR, Exh. 6.5, Questions and Answers (Q&A) at 9.  In response, the agency stated:  \u201cDo not include branding information as a picture if it includes text.  Instead include your company information in accordance with the solicitation instructions. \u201d  Id. \n \n \n1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274  The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the \nformatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  \n \n[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or deficient and will \nbe considered ineligible for award.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA quote will be deemed unacceptable if it does not . . . comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this solicitation.  \nRFQ. at 51, 64.  \n The solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  \n \nA deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of the \nRequest for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or unacceptable \nwithin this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  [vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is \ndetermined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s are cautioned to ensure all the \nsolicitation requirements are met.   [Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention \nto the details of this solicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] \u2019s ability to follow explicit \ninstructions is critical to the performance of the resulting orders from this \naward.  \n A quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .\u201d  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA failure to provide the information called for .  . .  or a failure to provide the \ninformation in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . .  The evaluation of a[n]  [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  will end upon a \ndetermination that  the [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  \n Id. at 63-64. \n The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s \nto determine whether quotations  were \u201ccompliant with the criteria and instructions of the \nRFQ,\u201d unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law \n(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 10.2, Notice of Elimination.     Page 4 B-423274  As part of its submission, FIC\u2019s quotation included its corporate logo on the cover page \nof each of its quotation volumes.  Protest at 3.  The corporate logo was a picture that spelled out \u201cFI CONSULTING.\u201d  Id.   After the initial compliance review of FIC\u2019s \nquotation, the agency determined that the quotation failed to comply with the RFQ\u2019s formatting instructions because FIC\u2019s \u201ccover pages contain images with text (Branding Images).\u201d  AR, Exh. 10.2, Notice of Eli mination.   The use of pictures with text was not \npermissible under the RFQ\u2019s instructions.  RFQ at 51.  Upon notification of its elimination, FIC filed this protest on January 9, 2025.   \n DISCUSSION  FIC asserts that the agency improperly excluded its quotation due to a latent  ambiguity \nin the solicitation\u2019s formatting instructions that prohibited the inclusion of text with pictures.  Protest at 4; Comments at 1.  The protester alleges that a reasonable \ninterpretation of the formatting instructions is that the prohibition did not apply to company logos.  Protest at 5.  In the alternative, protester argues that the agency was \nrequired under FAR section 14.405 to waive the error as a minor informality.  Id. at 6.  \nFor the reasons explained below, we find that the solicitation was not ambiguous and the agency reasonably eliminated the protester\u2019s quotation in accordance with the \nsolicitation\u2019s instructions.  \n Quotation Formatting Requirements  \n The protester does not dispute that its quotation included its corporate logo, which was a picture with text, but rather alleges that the solicitation instructions for pictures were \nlatently ambiguous.  Comments at 1.  Specifically, FIC explains that the formatting instructions that prohibit pictures with text did not apply to company logos because inclusion of its company name does not include text intended for \u201c[a]gency review as part of its evaluation\u201d  of FIC\u2019s quotation.  Protest at 5; Comments at 1.  I n this regard, \nthe protester explains that the solicitation instructions regarding \u201ctext\u201d in pictures are included with instructions for \u201cpage margins, font size, and line spacing.\u201d  Protest at 4.  The protester argues that the agency\u2019s intent was that vendors not use \u201cillustrations\u201d or \u201cpictures\u201d with text to \u201ccircumvent the [s]olicitation\u2019s instructions regarding margins, font size and line spacing.\u201d  Protest at 4; Comments at 2.  FIC contends that its interpretation of the formatting instructions should be accepted as \u201creasonable.\u201d  Protest at 5.    The agency contends it properly eliminated FIC\u2019s quotation because the protester included a picture with text on the cover page in \u201call four volumes\u201d and thus \u201cignored the solicitation requirement\u201d and the agency response as part of the Q&A process.\n2  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 4, AR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A.  The agency maintains \nthat the protester\u2019s \u201cinterpretation fails because based on the plain language of the RFQ \n \n2 The vendor Q&As were incorporated in the solicitation by amendment to ensure that \nsolicitation \u201crequirements were clear and that any ambiguities were resolved.\u201d  COS \nat 4; AR, Exh. 6.1, RFQ. amend. 0002.    Page 5 B-423274  instructions, as well as the agency response to the Q&A, it was not reasonable for FIC \nto assume that the RFQ requirements regarding text in images did not apply to an [vendor]\u2019s logo or that the RFQ requirement did not apply to cover pages.\u201d  MOL at 3.  \n Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation \nmust be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 163 at 5.  An \nambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the terms or specifica tions of the solicitation are possible.  The HP Grp., LLC , B-415285, Dec. 14, \n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 385 at 5.  A patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error, while a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.   Where \nthere is a latent ambiguity, both parties\u2019 interpretations of the provision may be reasonable, and the appropriate course of action is to clarify the requirement and afford offerors an opportunity to submit proposals based on the clarified requirement.  Qwes t \nGov\u2019t Servs., Inc . d\/b\/a CenturyLink QGS , B-419597, B -419597.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 217 at 5 n. 7. \n As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for pictures, specifically stating that \u201c . . . Illustrations may be placed as an imbedded picture, as long as the \npicture does not contain text .\u201d  RFQ at 51.   Moreover, the agency clarified formatting \nrequirements for pictures.  In response to a vendor\u2019s question regarding whether it was permissible to include company logos on quotation cover pages, the agency explained, \u201c[d]o not include branding information as a picture if it includes text.  Instead include \nyour company  information in accordance with the solicitation instructions .\u201d  COS at 4; \nAR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A at 9.  Stated otherwise, the solicitation instructions and agency \nresponse to the question both cautioned that pictures should not contain text.   \n On this record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity as alleged by the protester.  FIC\u2019s interpretation that company logos including text were exempt from the picture formatting requirements is incompatible with the solicitation instructions.  The protester \u2019s interpretation ignores the solicitation language, highlighted in bold font, that \nexplained that pictures should not contain text.  RFQ at 51.  To the extent this language did not make the agency\u2019s requirements plain, the agency\u2019s response, during the Q&A process, that \u201cbranding information\u201d should not include text if provided as a picture, foreclosed the protester\u2019s alternative interpretation.  AR, Exh. 6.5, Q&A at 9.  On these facts, we conclude that the protester's interpretation of the solicitation was not reasonable and that, therefore, no ambiguity exists.   \n Moreover, as explained above, t he RFQ included several sections which emphasized \nthat failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a \n\u201cdeficiency ,\u201d which mandated elimination from competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  In \nresponse to the protest, the agency explains that these instructions were intentionally included in bold font  to draw attention to these requirements.   COS at 4.  In this regard,  \nthe contracting officer states that the solicitation \u201cwas designed to select only thos e  Page 6 B-423274  contractors capable of following detailed instructions\u201d and that the RFQ \u201cstates the \nimportance of a [vendor\u2019s] ability to follow detailed instructions.\u201d  For these reasons, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d instead of discretionary terms such as \u201cmay\u201d which was an \u201cintentional and deliberate deviation\u201d from previous solicitations that was \u201cmade to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor\u2019s] \nability to follow directions.\u201d  Id. at 2.   \n On this record, we find FIC\u2019s interpretation of the RFQ to be unreasonable, and the agency\u2019s elimination of FIC\u2019s quotation to be reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Consequently, this protest ground is denied.  \n Waiver of Minor Informalities  \n In the alternative, the protester argues that the agency should have waived FIC\u2019s failure to follow solicitation instructions as a minor informality under FAR section 14.405.  Protest at 6.  The protester argues that including its company logo on the quotation cover pages did not permit FIC to have more space for quotation content than other vendors.  Id .  Furthermore, the \u201cdeviation\u201d was \u201cminor and immaterial,\u201d and inclusion of \nits quotation only serves to benefit the agency with increased competition.  I d.   \n In response, the agency argues that the \u201cability or inability to conform to the easy and clearly stated RFQ instruction is a material component of the RFQ to [en]sure that the [vendors] that received the award can deliver the quality of work that is expected under this BPA.\u201d  MOL at 4 -5.  Furthermore, the agency asserts that waiver of FIC\u2019s error is \ncontradictory to the RFQ\u2019s purpose and unfair to vendors who foll owed solicitation \ninstructions.  Id. at 5.     \n The protester has failed to allege a cognizable basis of protest because the protester\u2019s reliance on FAR section 14.405 is misplaced.\n3  Section 14.405 of the FAR applies to \nsealed bidding procedures under FAR part 14 and therefore is not applicable to the federal supply schedule procedures used here under FAR subpart 8.4.  As such, the protester\u2019s contention that the agency was required to ignore or waive the minor and immaterial errors fails to state adequate legal grounds of protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.5(f); \nsee Inalab Consulting, Inc. , B-418950, Oct.  9, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  327 at 6 (finding that \nthe decision to waive a solicitation requirement, even when permissible, is a  \n \n3 Our Bid Protest Regulations,  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7  21.1(c)(4) and (f) , require that a protest \ninclude a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.

Protest alleging that the awardee\u2019s proposal contained material misrepresentations \nis denied where, even assuming for the sake of argument that the proposal contained misrepresentations, they had no significant impact on the agency\u2019s evaluation.  \n 2.  Protest challenging past performance evaluation is denied where the agency reasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019s past performance in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria.  \n 3.  Protest challenging the agency\u2019s comparative analysis and source selection decision is denied where the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff and source selection decision were \nreasonable, adequately document ed, and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  \nDECISION  \n \nQuantum Research International, Inc., a small business of Huntsville, Alabama, protests \nthe issuance of a task order to PeopleTec, Inc., a small business also of Huntsville, Alabama, under task order requirement package (TORP) No.  24-005, issued by the \nDepartment of the Army for program management, scientific, engineering, logistics, financial, and ancillary services in support of the agency\u2019s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO).  The protester contends that the agency\u2019s corrective action in response to a previously -filed protest was unreasonable; \nPeopleTec\u2019s proposal contained a material misrepresentation requiring its disqualification from the competition; the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec\u2019s DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   proposal under the past performance factor ; and the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff \nanalysis was unreasonable, inadequately documented, and improperly used a \nlowest -priced, technically acceptable source selection method.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On May  20, 2024, the agency issued the TORP pursuant to the fair opportunity source \nselection procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5 to small \nbusiness firms holding indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts under \nsmall business pool  4 of the General Services Administration\u2019s One Acquisition Solution \nfor Integrated Services program.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at  1; Agency \nReport (AR), Tab 26, Amended TORP at  1.  The TORP, which the agency amended six \ntimes, sought proposals to pr ovide services in support of rapid prototyping efforts and \nthe delivery of residual combat capabilities that address immediate, near -term, and \nmid-term threats faced by Army operational units.  COS at  2; AR, Tab  20, Amended \nPerformance Work Statement (PWS) at  3.  The agency refers to the task order to be \nissued as the RCCTO Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Support (SETA) task order.  \n The TORP contemplated issuance of  a single cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a \n3-year base period and one 2- year option on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering \nfour factors:  task execution; qualifications and experience; past performance; and cost\/price .  COS at  1-2; Amended TORP at  3, 16-17.  The task execution factor was \nmore important than the qualifications and experience factor, which was more important than the past performance factor.  Amended TORP at  17.  The past performance factor , \nin turn,  was more important than cost\/price.  Id.  The non- cost\/price factors, when \ncombined, were significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  \n Relevant to the protester\u2019s allegations, the TORP\u2019s instructions for  the past performance \nfactor directed offerors to identify no more than five contracts performed by the offeror or a major subcontractor --defined as a subcontractor proposed to perform 10 percent or \nmore of the effort --that were relevant to the competed requirement and either current or \ncompleted within the last five years.  Id.  at 9.  Offerors were to provide a narrative \ndescribing how each effort was similar to the requirement, as well as  a crosswalk \nbetween each effort and the PWS.  Id.  at 9-10.  The TORP further provided that the \nagency, at its discretion, could assess \u201crecent and relevant performance data obtained from other [g]overnment data sources .  . . as they relate to the North American Industry \nClassification System (NAICS) codes 541715,  541330, 541712 or other relevant codes.\u201d  \nId. at 18. \n With respect to the evaluation of past performance, the TORP stated that the agency would \u201cevaluate the offeror\u2019s record of recent and relevant performance history which must provide the [agency] a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.\u201d  Id.  To meet the recency requirement, the TORP required  Page 3    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   the effort to have been performed within the past five years and stated that if \nperformance had not occurred within the previous five years, the effort \u201cwill be considered to not meet the requirement as related to recency.\u201d  Id. \n The TORP stated that the agency would \u201cevaluate if the submitted [p]ast [p]erformance is relevant based upon the ratings outlined\u201d below:  \n \nRating  Description  \nVery Relevant  Present\/past performance effort involved essentially the same \nscope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation \nrequires.  \nRelevant  Present\/past performance effort involved similar scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  \nSomewhat \nRelevant  Present\/past performance effort involved some of the scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  \nNot Relevant  Present\/past performance involved little or none of the scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  \n Id. at 18, 21- 22.  The TORP further defined \u201crelevant\u201d as follows:  \n \nRelevant is defined as federal contractual efforts that are similar to the requirements specified in the solicitation in terms of scope (performance requirements\/contractual aspects), magnitude (dollar value), and complexity as indicated by performance that (i)  primarily involved the \nmanagement of large subcontracting teams (i.e. more than 5 team \nmembers or subcontractors) in performing engineering services, [p]rogram management support, test and evaluation activities, financial management activities, and security support similar to that required by the PWS, (ii) represented a total potential value of at least $20M annually (applicable \nto prime offerors only), and (iii) was executed under a cost -type contract \n(applicable to prime offerors only).  \n \nId. at 18-19. \n Finally, the TORP stated that the agency would assess the quality of the offeror\u2019s recent and relevant performance record, \u201cfocus[ing] on whether the performance met contract requirements, the frequency of performance problems, and the effectiveness of corrective action taken by the contractor.\u201d  Id.  at 19.  The agency \u201creserve[d] the right to \nuse data provided by the offeror in its proposal[;] data obtained from interviews with cognizant [g]overnment personnel having knowledge of the offeror\u2019s performance;  data \nobtained from applicable contract files; and\/or data obtained from other sources such as the [Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past \nPerformance Information Retrieval System, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity \nInforma tion System,] or other [g]overnmental databases.\u201d  Id.  \n  Page 4    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   The TORP provided that the agency would assign a confidence rating under the past \nperformance factor in accordance with the following definitions:  \n \nRating  Description  \nSubstantial \nConfidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has a high expectation that the offeror will \nsuccessfully perform the required effort.  \nSatisfactory \nConfidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror \nwill successfully perform the required effort.  \nNeutral Confidence  No recent\/relevant performance record is available or the \nofferor\u2019s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.  The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on \nthe factor of past  performance.  \nLimited Confidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has a low expectation that the offeror will \nsuccessfully perform the required effort.  \nNo Confidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has no expectation that the offeror will be \nable to successfully perform the required effort.  \n Id. at 22. \n The agency received proposals from six offerors, including the protester and PeopleTec , by the TORP\u2019s closing date of August  16, 2024.  COS at  2.  On \nDecember  4, the agency issued a task order to PeopleTec, and the protester \nsubsequently filed a protest with our Office on December  17, alleging that the agency \nerred in its evaluation and that PeopleTec materially misrepresented its corporate experience.  Id. at 5-6; Quantum Rsch. Int\u2019l, Inc., B -423237, Jan.  16, 2025 (unpublished \ndecision).   Thereafter, the agency advised that it would reevaluate proposals and make \na new award decision, as well as tak e any other appropriate action consistent with \nprocurement regulations, and we therefore dismissed the protest as academic.  Quantum Rsch. , supra .  While the protester objected to dismissal on the ground that the \nagency did not specifically represent that it would investigate the alleged material misrepresentation, we concluded that the protester\u2019s objection merely anticipated improper action by the agency, as the agency had not represented that it would not investigate or consider the alleged material misrepresentation in its reevaluation.  Id.  \n As discussed further below, during the reevaluation of  proposals, the agency requested \nadditional informati on from both the protester and PeopleTec regarding past contracts \nsubmitted as part of their respective proposals, including the effort about which the protester had alleged PeopleTec\u2019s proposal contained a material misrepresentation.  COS at  6-7, 9.  Upon completing the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following \nadjectival ratings to the proposals submitted by the protester and PeopleTec:  \n  Page 5    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    Quantum  PeopleTec  \nTASK EXECUTION  Outstanding  Outstanding  \nQUALIFICATIONS AND \nEXPERIENCE  Outstanding  Good  \nPAST PERFORMANCE  Meets Requirements;  \nVery Relevant;  \nSubstantial Confidence  Meets Requirements;  \nSomewhat Relevant;  \nSatisfactory Confidence  \nPROPOSED COST\/PRICE  $298,612,979  $261,125,292  \nPROBABLE COST\/PRICE  $307,123,760  $269,769,896  \n \nAR, Tab  63, Task Order Decision Document (TODD) at  6. \n In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that PeopleTec\u2019s proposal was superior under the task execution factor, which was the most important under the TORP\u2019s terms, because it presented additional strengths that the protester\u2019s proposal did not also offer.  Id.  at 30-31.  The agency further concluded that the protester\u2019s \nproposal was superior under the qualifications and experience and past performance factors.  Id. at 30.  While the agency concluded that the protester\u2019s proposal overall was \ntechnically superior to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal, it  further determined that the protester\u2019s \nproposal was not sufficiently advantageous to merit the associated price premium.  Id.  \nat 33.  The agency therefore determined that PeopleTec\u2019s proposal offered the best \nvalue to the agency, and consequently issued the task order to PeopleTec.  Id.  at 33-34. \n This protest followed.\n1 \n DISCUSSION \n \nThe protester contends that PeopleTec\u2019s  proposal contained a material \nmisrepresentation regarding PeopleTec\u2019s role on a past performance effort , and  that the \nagency therefore was required to disqualify PeopleTec from the competition.  Relatedly, \nthe protester alleges that the agency\u2019s corrective action in response to the previous protest was unreasonable, arguing that the agency failed to reasonably investigate that alleged misrepresentation.  The protester further alleges that the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec\u2019s proposal under the past performance factor.  Lastly, the protester contends that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff determination was \nunreasonable, inadequately documented, and not in accordance with the TORP\u2019s \n \n1 As the total evaluated cost\/price of the task order at issue here exceeds $10 million, \nthis procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under civilian agency IDIQ contracts.  41 U.S.C. \u00a7  4106(f)(1)(B).

For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that there is no basis on which to \nsustain the protest.2 \n \nMaterial Misrepresentation and Corrective Action  Two of the protester\u2019s allegations center around a task order --referred to as Mission \nPlanning, Advance Decision Support Data Analytics Tools, and Cyber Hardening \u2013 \nSecure Environment Contract (MATCH SEC) --that was performed by CybEx , LLC, a \njoint venture (JV) formed by the protester and PeopleTec.\n3  In the past performance \nvolume of its proposal, PeopleTec described its role on MATCH SEC in relevant part as \nfollows:  \n \nPeopleTec, a JV member during [task order] execution, performs as the \n[task order] lead--managing nine different projects being performed for \n[U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command], [U.S. Space Force], 82nd Airborne Division, [Federal Bureau of Investigation], [Office of the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and \nTechnology ,] and other customers, each requiring different technical skill \nsets.  . . .

As Quantum \u2019s \nproposal had not included any discussion of MATCH SEC, the protester raised concerns about the debr iefing statement in its follow- up questions.  Id.  at 8.

As part of that corrective action--which also included the reevaluation of proposals --the agency asked PeopleTec \nto answer the following questions:  \n \n1.  Was PeopleTec a participating member of the Cybex JV during the performance of the MATCH SEC Task Order?  2.  Did PeopleTec serve as a Task Order Lead for the MATCH SEC T ask \nOrder?  \n 3.

And the protester and \nintervenor have collectively proffered several  declarations regarding CybEx \u2019s \noperations, the protester \u2019s and intervenor\u2019s respective roles therein, and their  \nresponsibilities performed under MATCH SEC.

We need \nnot--and do not --wade into the morass of questions of semantics, corporate \ngovernance, and competing accounts that the parties have provided, however, as the record demonstrates that  the alleged misrepresentation did not have a significant \nimpact  on the evaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance.  \n PeopleTec\u2019s proposal included information regarding five efforts , two performed by \nPeopleTec and three performed respectively by its two proposed major subcontractors .  \nAR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3-7.  In conducting its \nreevaluation of proposals, t he agency first concluded that each of those efforts met the \nTORP\u2019s recency requirement.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation \nat 3-4.  After reviewing the scope, magnitude, and complexity of each effort, the agency \nassigned them the following relevancy ratings:  \n  Page 9    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Effort  Performing Entity  Relevancy Rating  \nReference No. 1 PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  \nMATCH SEC  PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  \nReference No. 3 Subcontractor 1  Somewhat Relevant  \nReference No. 4 Subcontractor 1  Relevant  \nReference No. 5 Subcontractor 2  Relevant  \n \nId. at 4-6. \n In assigning relevancy ratings, the agency noted that PeopleTec\u2019s first three references --including MATCH SEC--had annual values below $20 million,\n5 involved \nservices similar to  some of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and, while the first two involved the \nmanagement of subcontractors, they  did not involve the management of more than five \nsubcontractors.  Id. at 4-5.  Consequently, the agency concluded that these references  \ninvolved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP and assigned ratings of somewhat relevant to th em.  Id.  By contrast, the agency \nnoted that the remaining two references had annual values well in excess of $20 million, \ninvolved services similar to some or most of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and involved the management of substantially more than five subcontractors.  Id.  at 5-6.  The agency \ntherefore concluded that they involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP, assigning ratings of relevant to those references.  Id. \n The agency then assigned an overall relevancy rating of somewhat relevant, noting that because PeopleTec\u2019s proposed subcontractors had performed the fourth and fifth references , PeopleTec  itself did not possess any fully relevant past performance as a \nprime contractor.  Id. at 6.  Nevertheless, the agency concluded, PeopleTec\u2019s past \nefforts collectively \u201cspan[ned] the entirety of the RCCTO PWS\u201d and therefore merited a rating of somewhat relevant.  Id.  Because of \u201cprevious litigation invoking the MATCH \nSEC effort,\u201d i.e., the previously -filed protest, t he contracting officer  also \u201cconsidered \nwhether PeopleTec adequately demonstrated sufficient past performance without considering the MATCH SEC effort .\u201d  Id.  Excluding MATCH SEC, the contracting officer \nconcluded that  PeopleTec \u2019s proposal nevertheless  had demonstrated sufficient past \nperformance because of the collective experience shown by its other efforts.  Id. \n In assessing the quality of PeopleTec\u2019s performance, the agency queried CPARS to locate performance assessments  for each reference.  Id.  at 6-8.  Notably, there were \nmultiple performance assessments available for each of PeopleTec\u2019s references except for MATCH SEC, for which CPARS did not contain any assessments.  Id.   For that \n \n5 As discussed above, the agency\u2019s debriefing to the protester containing the mistaken \nreference to MATCH SEC characterized that task order as having a value of $77 million, \nbut PeopleTec\u2019s proposal and the agency\u2019s evaluation make clear that its annual value \nis $17.5 million.  See  AR, Tab 44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3; Tab 55, \nPeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  5.  Page 10    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   effort, the only performance data available to the agency were statements from the \ncontracting officer\u2019s representative (COR)  in response to the agency\u2019s inquiry , who \nstated that CybEx  \u201cperformed well on the effort and there were no noted performance \nissues.\u201d  Id.  at 7.  The agency also reviewed all of the CPARS ratings for the previous \nfive years for PeopleTec and its proposed major subcontractors, finding no adverse information.  Id. at 8.  Considering all of the past performance information, the agency \ndetermined that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance, and \ntherefore assigned a rating of satisfactory confidence to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal.  Id.  \n The agency and intervenor contend, in part, that the agency\u2019s consideration of PeopleTec\u2019s performance on MATCH SEC did not have a significant impact upon the evaluation, and that the alleged misrepresentation therefore was not material .  MOL \nat 32-33; Supp. MOL at  37-46; Intervenor Comments at  6-7; Intervenor Supp. \nComments at  4-5.  On the record before us, we agree.   As an initial matter, the agency \nconcluded that MATCH SEC, like all four of the other references, met the TORP\u2019s recency requirements, and i ts relevancy rating of somewhat relevant is the same \nassigned to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal overall under the past performance factor.  MATCH SEC also  was similar to the other two references the agency found to be somewhat \nrelevant in that all three references had annual values below $20 million, involved \nservices similar to some , but not most or all,  of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and did not \ninvolve the management of more than five subcontractors.  \n The record also reflects that the agency considered MATCH SEC to be less relevant than the two references found to be relevant , which  had annual values over  $20 million, \ninvolved services similar to some or most of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and involved the \nmanagement of more than five subcontractors.   Furthermore, the crosswalk contained \nin PeopleTec\u2019s proposal shows that, for each PWS paragraph to which MATCH SEC mapped, at least one other reference also mapped to that paragraph.  See  AR, Tab  44, \nPeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9.  Thus, when viewed in context of all of \nPeopleTec\u2019s past performance efforts, the record demonstrates that the agency\u2019s consideration of MATCH SEC likely neither raised nor lowered the overall relevancy \nrating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal.  \n Additionally, as noted above, the agency was able to review multiple CPARS assessments for each of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance references, with the lone exception of MATCH SEC.  The overwhelming majority of the ratings for those assessments, which covered multiple performance periods, are either very good or \nexceptional.  See  AR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  6-8.  In \ncontrast, the only information available to the agency regarding PeopleTec\u2019s performance on MATCH SEC was the COR\u2019s short , general  statement that CybEx  had \nperformed well and that there were no noted performance issues.  Thus, there was substantially more performance information available to the agency regarding the non-MATCH SEC efforts, including multiple positive performance assessments \nregarding more relevant efforts.  \n  Page 11    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In assigning a satisfactory confidence rating to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal, the agency noted \nthat PeopleTec \u201chas presented somewhat relevant past performance information and there is clear demonstration of the offeror\u2019s ability and its major subcontractor[s\u2019] ability to perform somewhat similar work successfully through various CPARS  [assessments] .\u201d  \nId. at 8.  In light of the evaluation finding that MATCH SEC was only somewhat relevant \nto the TORP\u2019s requirements , the duplication in other references\u2019 relevance t o the PWS \nrequirements,  and the limited performance information regarding MATCH SEC that was \navailable to the agency, that would remain a reasonable conclusion even if MATCH SEC were to be removed from the agency\u2019s consideration, as the record of the evaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s other past performance efforts wholly supports the agency\u2019s \nevaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance .  Additionally, the agency\u2019s comparison of \nthe technical merits of the two proposals does not discuss MATCH SEC at all.  See  AR, \nTab 63, TODD at  30-31. \n On this record, we therefore conclude that the agency\u2019s consideration of MATCH SEC \nhad no significant impact  on the agency\u2019s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating \nto PeopleTec\u2019s proposal.

Where the protester fails to \ndemonstrate that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have a substantial chance of receiving an award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Id.  at 7-8.  As discussed above, we conclude that the agency\u2019s \nconsideration of MATCH SEC had no significant impact  on the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nPeopleTec\u2019s  past performance.  Thus, to whatever extent the protester\u2019s prior \nallegations of material misrepresentation warranted a more searching inquiry than that performed by the agency, the protester cannot demonstrate any reasonable probability of prejudice aris ing out of the agency\u2019s failure to seek more information than that \ngleaned through its questions.\n6  We therefore deny this ground of protest as well.  \n \n6 While the protester contends that the agency should have disqualified PeopleTec from \nthe competition prior to the reevaluation conducted as part of the agency\u2019s corrective \naction, see Protest at  10; Comments & Supp. Protest at  7; Supp. Comments at  4, our \ndecisions have concluded that \u201cthe mere fact that an agency identified a \nmisrepresentation that it believes had a material influence on the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals does not obligate the agency to disqualify\u201d the offeror.

Management and Tech. Servs. \nAlliance Joint Venture, B -422786 et al. , Nov.  6, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 264 at  5.  A \nprotester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment does not establish that a n \nevaluation w as unreasonable.  Id.  \n The protester first contends that the agency improperly assigned relevancy ratings of somewhat relevant to the two references in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal performed by PeopleTec itself.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  17-21.  The protester argues that \nbecause the TORP defined \u201crelevant\u201d in terms of criteria the agency would use to assess similarity of scope, magnitude, and complexity, it set minimum requirements  that \nhad to be met in order to merit a rating other than \u201cnot relevant.\u201d   Thus, for example, the \nprotest er contends that the rating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec\u2019s first \npast performance reference was improper because, as the agency concluded, it  \n(i) involve d the management of five--i.e., not more than five--subcontractors  in \nperforming similar requirements; and (ii) ha d an annual value of $7.68 million --i.e., less \nthan $20 million .  Id. at 17-18.  The agency responds that, under a plain reading, the \nTORP did not establish minimum criteria for relevance, and the agency\u2019s assignment of somewhat relevant ratings was reasonable and in accordance with the TORP, as the references had some similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to the solicited requirement.  Supp. MOL at  53-56. \n The protester\u2019s argument rests upon an unreasonable reading of the TORP.  While the TORP laid out criteria against which the agency would evaluate past performance references for relevance, it also provided for the assessment of relevance on a scale.   \nThus, a reference involving \u201csome of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires\u201d would merit  a rating of somewhat relevant  under \nthe TORP\u2019s terms , while a reference involving \u201csimilar scope and magnitude of effort \nand complex ities this solicitation requires\u201d would merit a rating of relevant.  To find, as \nthe protester urges, that the TORP\u2019s criteria for scope, magnitude, and complexity were minimum requirements , a reference meeting all of those putatively minimum \nrequirements necessarily would merit a rating of relevant, as it would involve \u201csimilar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities\u201d  as those terms are defined in the  Page 13    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   TORP,  not \u201csome of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities.\u201d  In that way, \nthe protester\u2019s argument  would read the rating of somewhat relevant out of the TORP \u2019s \nrelevance scale, and therefore is not a reasonable reading of the TORP.  See, e.g. , ICF \nInc., L.L.C., B -421850 et al. , Nov.  7, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 254 at  7 (\u201cWhere a protester \nand agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the \nmatter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.\u201d).   \nWe therefore deny this ground of protest.\n7 \n \nThe protester next alleges that the agency\u2019s consideration of additional CPARS \nassessments for efforts beyond those submitted in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal was improper, \nas the agency made no determination that those efforts were relevant to the instant \nrequirem ent.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-30.  The record reflects, however, that \nthe only conclusion the agency drew from its review of those performance assessments  \nwas that there was \u201cno adverse information\u201d with respect to PeopleTec or its proposed major subcontractors.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8.  \nThus, the agency\u2019s consideration of the additional CPARS assessments did not have the effect of improving PeopleTec\u2019s past performance evaluation; rather, the record \nreflects that the agency only confirmed the absence of negative performance information.   Accordingly, to whatever extent the agency erred in not determining the \nrelevance of these efforts, the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prejudice arising from that alleged error.   We therefore deny this protest allegation as \nwell. \n \nFinally, the protester contends that the agency\u2019s assignment of a rating of satisfactory \nconfidence to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal was unreasonable because it was based upon the agency\u2019s conclusion that PeopleTec\u2019s past efforts collectively spanned the R CCTO \nSETA PWS, which the protester argues is not supported by the crosswalk contained in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal .  Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-35.  The TORP\u2019s instructions \nrequired offerors to \u201ccrosswalk to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PWS\u201d --i.e., \nparagr aph 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and so forth.   Amended TORP at  9.  PeopleTec\u2019s proposal \nincluded that crosswalk, see AR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9, \nbut as the protester points out, it does not tie any past performance reference to eight out of the 58 third- level paragraphs, Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-32.\n8  \n \n7 Because the protester has not advanced a reasonable reading of the solicitation, we \nsimilarly deny its allegation that the TORP was latently ambiguous as to whether the relevance criteria were minimum requirements.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 23-24; ICF, supra at 7 (\u201cAn ambiguity exists were two or more reasonable \ninterpretations of the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible.\u201d).  \n8 The protester further contends that, if the two references performed by PeopleTec \nwere removed, that number would grow to 17.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  32-34.  As \ndiscussed above, however, we conclude that the agency reasonably considered those references in its evaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance.   Page 14    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Consequently, the protester contends, the agency\u2019s assignment of a satisfactory \nconfidence rating rests upon an erroneous foundation.  \n The contracting officer states --and the protester agrees --that the TORP \u201chad no stated \nminimum threshold in [the] number of third level paragraphs any offeror was required to meet.\u201d  Supp. COS at  9; Supp. Comments at  25.  While the agency\u2019s response does not \nsquarely meet the gravamen of the protester\u2019s argument --that the agency unreasonably \ndetermined, based on the crosswalk in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal, that PeopleTec\u2019s past efforts collectively spanned the PWS\u2019s requirement s--it highlights the distinction our  \nOffice has recognized between instructions and evaluation criteria.  \n We previously have concluded that information provided in a solicitation\u2019s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria detailed in a solicitation\u2019s evaluation section.  STAcqMe LLC , B-417128, Feb.  25, 2019, 2019  CPD \u00b6 95 at  5; \nUniversity Rsch. Co., LLC , B-294358.6, B -294358.7, Apr.  20, 2005, 2005 CPD \u00b6 83 \nat 18.  In this regard, rather than establishing minimum evaluation standards, a \nsolicitation\u2019s instructions to offerors section generally provides guidance to assist offerors in preparing and organizing their proposal s.  STAcqMe , supra at 5.  The \ninformation required by the instructions does not have to correspond to the evaluation criteria.  University Rsch. , supra at 18. \n Here, while the TORP\u2019s instructions directed offerors to crosswalk their past performance references to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PW S, its evaluation \ncriteria were silent as to how the agency would assess the breadth of an offeror\u2019s past performance.  See  Amended TORP at  18-19.  Thus, as the contracting officer points \nout, the TORP did not require that an offeror demonstrate past performance for each of the third- level paragraphs.  More saliently, though, because the TORP did not require \nsuch a demonstration, we conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the  \nagency\u2019s conclusion that PeopleTec\u2019s \u201ccollective [p]ast [p]erformance record with available assessments covers the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS .\u201d  \nAR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8. \n Paragraph 2.0 of the PWS contained eight substantive paragraphs at the second level, \nstarting at paragraph 2.1 and concluding with paragraph 2.8, each covering a category \nof services such as program management services or financial management services, and each also containing several third- level paragraphs  discussing more granular tasks \nwithin  those services .  See Amended PWS at  10-28.  PeopleTec\u2019s crosswalk tied past \nperformance references to all of the third- level paragraphs within paragraphs  2.1 to 2.4 \nand 2.7 to 2.8.  The missing third- level paragraphs fall within paragraphs  2.5 and 2.6.  \nWithin those paragraphs, however, PeopleTec\u2019s crosswalk provides references for seven out of the 10 third- level paragraphs within paragraph 2.5, and 11 out of the 16 \nthird-level paragraphs within paragraph 2.6.  Thus, with respect to the missing \nthird-level paragraphs, PeopleTec\u2019s proposal nevertheless demonstrates past \nperformance covering a majority of the tasks contained within the services to which the PWS relates t hose tasks.  \n  Page 15    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In demonstrating experience with the entirety of the tasks contemplated by paragraphs \n2.1 to 2.4 and 2.7 to 2.8, as well as a clear majority of the tasks contemplated by \nparagraphs 2.5 and 2.6, PeopleTec\u2019s crosswalk does \u201ccover[] the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS [,]\u201d as the agency concluded in its evaluation.   \nAdditionally, the breadth of successful past performance demonstrated by PeopleTec\u2019s proposal is consistent with the agency\u2019s conclusion that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance here.  The assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating therefore is consistent with the TO RP\u2019s definition for that rating.  Consequently, the \nrecord contradicts the protester\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating rests upon a faulty factual basis.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  \n Best-Value Tradeoff  \n Lastly, the protester challenges the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff, contending that it was \nbased upon a flawed evaluation, failed to adequately document tradeoffs, and improperly minimized technical differences between the proposals and instead focused on cost\/ price, thereby departing from the TORP\u2019s tradeoff basis of award.  Protest \nat 16-18; Comments & Supp. Protest at  35-41; Supp. Comments at  26-29.  The agency \nresponds that it reasonably performed and adequately documented its tradeoff analysis.  MOL at  41-45; Supp. MOL at  77-89. \n As an initial matter, the protester\u2019s argument that the best -value determination is \nunreasonable relies on the protester\u2019s various challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation, which we have denied for the reasons stated above.  Accordingly, we dismiss this \nallegation because allegations that are derivative of matter s that have already been \ndenied do not establish an independent basis of protest.  Management and Tech. Servs. , supra  at 9-10.  We also deny the protester\u2019s allegation that the agency failed to \nadequat ely document its tradeoff analysis, as the record demonstrates that the agency \nexamined and considered the qualitative merits of the proposals.  See  AR, Tab  63, \nTODD at  17-26 (discussing evaluation of each proposal), 30- 34 (comparing merits of \nproposals) ; see also Management and Tech. Servs. , supra  at 10 (\u201c[A]gencies are not \nrequired to conduct a line- by-line comparison of each benefit and risk.\u201d) (citing \nFAR 16.505(b)(7); ICF Inc., LLC --Costs , B-421850.5, Feb.  9, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 50 at  9; \nIronclad Tech.

Comments & Supp. Protest at  38-41.  The protester argues that the agency cited an \noffsetting strength of PeopleTec\u2019s proposal to minimize the protester\u2019s advantage under the past perform ance factor, thereby inflating the importance of cost\/price to the \nagency\u2019s best -value determination and effectively converting the basis of award to \nlowest -price, technically acceptable.  Id.   On our review of the record, we do not discern \na basis to sustain this ground of protest.   Page 16    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    \nIn comparing the two proposals, the agency noted the continuity benefits of the protester\u2019s major subcontractor.  AR, Tab 63, TODD at  30-31.  This discussion aligned \nwith a strength identified in the evaluation of the protester\u2019s proposal under the task execution factor, which noted that the protester had \u201ccommitments from incumbent \nsubcontractor team employees for 60 [percent]  of the total base year hours,\u201d and \nrecogniz ed the benefit that the protester\u2019s approach \u201cprovides an experienced workforce \nwith an understanding of RCCTO requirements and challenges[.]\u201d  Id.  at 22.  The \nagency further noted, however, that PeopleTec\u2019s proposal had a similar strength under the task execution factor, based on its \u201c [DELETED]  as part of its plan to maintain the \ncurrent workforce.\u201d  Id. at 18.  See also id. at 30-31 (discus sing the offsetting strengths).  \n The protester contends that the agency improperly considered these offsetting strengths with respect to the past performance factor, not the task execution factor, thereby minimizing the protester\u2019s advantage under the former.  While the TODD \u2019s comparative \nanalysis  does somewhat inartfully intermingle discussion of these strengths with its \ndiscussion of past performance, it also discusses \u201cany benefits related to incumbency\u201d within the context of \u201cother aspects of the [t]ask [e]xecution [f]actor ,\u201d in which \nPeopleTec\u2019s proposal \u201cpresent[ed] more strengths and the use of certain tools and approaches, the benefits of which are not replicated in [the protester\u2019s proposal].\u201d   Id. \nat 31.  That is consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals under the task \nexecution factor.   See id. at 17-18, 21- 22 (documenting assignment of strengths under \nthat factor).   The TODD further recognizes the superiority of the protester\u2019s proposal \nunder the qualifications and experience and past performance factors, while concluding that the overall superiority of the protester\u2019s proposal --driven by advantages in the two \ncomparatively less important non- cost\/price factors --did not justify the \u201csignificant \ncost\/price premium\u201d associated with the protester\u2019s proposal.  Id.  at 33.  Thus, the \nrecord does not support the protester\u2019s contention that the agency improperly minimized the advantages of its proposal under the past performance factor.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

The protester contends that the agency\u2019s corrective action in response to a previously -filed protest was unreasonable; \nPeopleTec\u2019s proposal contained a material misrepresentation requiring its disqualification from the competition; the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec\u2019s DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   proposal under the past performance factor ; and the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff \nanalysis was unreasonable, inadequately documented, and improperly used a \nlowest -priced, technically acceptable source selection method.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On May  20, 2024, the agency issued the TORP pursuant to the fair opportunity source \nselection procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5 to small \nbusiness firms holding indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts under \nsmall business pool  4 of the General Services Administration\u2019s One Acquisition Solution \nfor Integrated Services program.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at  1; Agency \nReport (AR), Tab 26, Amended TORP at  1.  The TORP, which the agency amended six \ntimes, sought proposals to pr ovide services in support of rapid prototyping efforts and \nthe delivery of residual combat capabilities that address immediate, near -term, and \nmid-term threats faced by Army operational units.  COS at  2; AR, Tab  20, Amended \nPerformance Work Statement (PWS) at  3.  The agency refers to the task order to be \nissued as the RCCTO Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Support (SETA) task order.  \n The TORP contemplated issuance of  a single cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a \n3-year base period and one 2- year option on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering \nfour factors:  task execution; qualifications and experience; past performance; and cost\/price .  COS at  1-2; Amended TORP at  3, 16-17.  The task execution factor was \nmore important than the qualifications and experience factor, which was more important than the past performance factor.  Amended TORP at  17.  The past performance factor , \nin turn,  was more important than cost\/price.  Id.  The non- cost\/price factors, when \ncombined, were significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  \n Relevant to the protester\u2019s allegations, the TORP\u2019s instructions for  the past performance \nfactor directed offerors to identify no more than five contracts performed by the offeror or a major subcontractor --defined as a subcontractor proposed to perform 10 percent or \nmore of the effort --that were relevant to the competed requirement and either current or \ncompleted within the last five years.  Id.  at 9.  Offerors were to provide a narrative \ndescribing how each effort was similar to the requirement, as well as  a crosswalk \nbetween each effort and the PWS.  Id.  at 9-10.  The TORP further provided that the \nagency, at its discretion, could assess \u201crecent and relevant performance data obtained from other [g]overnment data sources .  . . as they relate to the North American Industry \nClassification System (NAICS) codes 541715,  541330, 541712 or other relevant codes.\u201d  \nId. at 18. \n With respect to the evaluation of past performance, the TORP stated that the agency would \u201cevaluate the offeror\u2019s record of recent and relevant performance history which must provide the [agency] a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.\u201d  Id.  To meet the recency requirement, the TORP required  Page 3    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   the effort to have been performed within the past five years and stated that if \nperformance had not occurred within the previous five years, the effort \u201cwill be considered to not meet the requirement as related to recency.\u201d  Id. \n The TORP stated that the agency would \u201cevaluate if the submitted [p]ast [p]erformance is relevant based upon the ratings outlined\u201d below:  \n \nRating  Description  \nVery Relevant  Present\/past performance effort involved essentially the same \nscope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation \nrequires.  \nRelevant  Present\/past performance effort involved similar scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  \nSomewhat \nRelevant  Present\/past performance effort involved some of the scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  \nNot Relevant  Present\/past performance involved little or none of the scope and \nmagnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  \n Id. at 18, 21- 22.  The TORP further defined \u201crelevant\u201d as follows:  \n \nRelevant is defined as federal contractual efforts that are similar to the requirements specified in the solicitation in terms of scope (performance requirements\/contractual aspects), magnitude (dollar value), and complexity as indicated by performance that (i)  primarily involved the \nmanagement of large subcontracting teams (i.e. more than 5 team \nmembers or subcontractors) in performing engineering services, [p]rogram management support, test and evaluation activities, financial management activities, and security support similar to that required by the PWS, (ii) represented a total potential value of at least $20M annually (applicable \nto prime offerors only), and (iii) was executed under a cost -type contract \n(applicable to prime offerors only).  \n \nId. at 18-19. \n Finally, the TORP stated that the agency would assess the quality of the offeror\u2019s recent and relevant performance record, \u201cfocus[ing] on whether the performance met contract requirements, the frequency of performance problems, and the effectiveness of corrective action taken by the contractor.\u201d  Id.  at 19.  The agency \u201creserve[d] the right to \nuse data provided by the offeror in its proposal[;] data obtained from interviews with cognizant [g]overnment personnel having knowledge of the offeror\u2019s performance;  data \nobtained from applicable contract files; and\/or data obtained from other sources such as the [Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past \nPerformance Information Retrieval System, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity \nInforma tion System,] or other [g]overnmental databases.\u201d  Id.  \n  Page 4    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   The TORP provided that the agency would assign a confidence rating under the past \nperformance factor in accordance with the following definitions:  \n \nRating  Description  \nSubstantial \nConfidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has a high expectation that the offeror will \nsuccessfully perform the required effort.  \nSatisfactory \nConfidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror \nwill successfully perform the required effort.  \nNeutral Confidence  No recent\/relevant performance record is available or the \nofferor\u2019s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.  The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on \nthe factor of past  performance.  \nLimited Confidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has a low expectation that the offeror will \nsuccessfully perform the required effort.  \nNo Confidence  Based on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, \nthe government has no expectation that the offeror will be \nable to successfully perform the required effort.  \n Id. at 22. \n The agency received proposals from six offerors, including the protester and PeopleTec , by the TORP\u2019s closing date of August  16, 2024.  COS at  2.  On \nDecember  4, the agency issued a task order to PeopleTec, and the protester \nsubsequently filed a protest with our Office on December  17, alleging that the agency \nerred in its evaluation and that PeopleTec materially misrepresented its corporate experience.  Id. at 5-6; Quantum Rsch. Int\u2019l, Inc., B -423237, Jan.  16, 2025 (unpublished \ndecision).   Thereafter, the agency advised that it would reevaluate proposals and make \na new award decision, as well as tak e any other appropriate action consistent with \nprocurement regulations, and we therefore dismissed the protest as academic.  Quantum Rsch. , supra .  While the protester objected to dismissal on the ground that the \nagency did not specifically represent that it would investigate the alleged material misrepresentation, we concluded that the protester\u2019s objection merely anticipated improper action by the agency, as the agency had not represented that it would not investigate or consider the alleged material misrepresentation in its reevaluation.  Id.  \n As discussed further below, during the reevaluation of  proposals, the agency requested \nadditional informati on from both the protester and PeopleTec regarding past contracts \nsubmitted as part of their respective proposals, including the effort about which the protester had alleged PeopleTec\u2019s proposal contained a material misrepresentation.  COS at  6-7, 9.  Upon completing the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following \nadjectival ratings to the proposals submitted by the protester and PeopleTec:  \n  Page 5    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    Quantum  PeopleTec  \nTASK EXECUTION  Outstanding  Outstanding  \nQUALIFICATIONS AND \nEXPERIENCE  Outstanding  Good  \nPAST PERFORMANCE  Meets Requirements;  \nVery Relevant;  \nSubstantial Confidence  Meets Requirements;  \nSomewhat Relevant;  \nSatisfactory Confidence  \nPROPOSED COST\/PRICE  $298,612,979  $261,125,292  \nPROBABLE COST\/PRICE  $307,123,760  $269,769,896  \n \nAR, Tab  63, Task Order Decision Document (TODD) at  6. \n In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that PeopleTec\u2019s proposal was superior under the task execution factor, which was the most important under the TORP\u2019s terms, because it presented additional strengths that the protester\u2019s proposal did not also offer.  Id.  at 30-31.  The agency further concluded that the protester\u2019s \nproposal was superior under the qualifications and experience and past performance factors.  Id. at 30.  While the agency concluded that the protester\u2019s proposal overall was \ntechnically superior to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal, it  further determined that the protester\u2019s \nproposal was not sufficiently advantageous to merit the associated price premium.  Id.  \nat 33.  The agency therefore determined that PeopleTec\u2019s proposal offered the best \nvalue to the agency, and consequently issued the task order to PeopleTec.  Id.  at 33-34. \n This protest followed.\n1 \n DISCUSSION \n \nThe protester contends that PeopleTec\u2019s  proposal contained a material \nmisrepresentation regarding PeopleTec\u2019s role on a past performance effort , and  that the \nagency therefore was required to disqualify PeopleTec from the competition.  Relatedly, \nthe protester alleges that the agency\u2019s corrective action in response to the previous protest was unreasonable, arguing that the agency failed to reasonably investigate that alleged misrepresentation.  The protester further alleges that the agency unreasonably evaluated PeopleTec\u2019s proposal under the past performance factor.  Lastly, the protester contends that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff determination was \nunreasonable, inadequately documented, and not in accordance with the TORP\u2019s \n \n1 As the total evaluated cost\/price of the task order at issue here exceeds $10 million, \nthis procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under civilian agency IDIQ contracts.  41 U.S.C. \u00a7  4106(f)(1)(B).  Page 6    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   terms .  For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that there is no basis on which to \nsustain the protest.2 \n \nMaterial Misrepresentation and Corrective Action  Two of the protester\u2019s allegations center around a task order --referred to as Mission \nPlanning, Advance Decision Support Data Analytics Tools, and Cyber Hardening \u2013 \nSecure Environment Contract (MATCH SEC) --that was performed by CybEx , LLC, a \njoint venture (JV) formed by the protester and PeopleTec.\n3  In the past performance \nvolume of its proposal, PeopleTec described its role on MATCH SEC in relevant part as \nfollows:  \n \nPeopleTec, a JV member during [task order] execution, performs as the \n[task order] lead--managing nine different projects being performed for \n[U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command], [U.S. Space Force], 82nd Airborne Division, [Federal Bureau of Investigation], [Office of the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and \nTechnology ,] and other customers, each requiring different technical skill \nsets.  . . . Leading MATCH SEC with the complexities of multiple \ncustomers and projects, and five subcontractors has equipped PeopleTec \nwith the experience and expertise to support RCCTO and its project offices as a prime contractor.  \n \nAR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  5.\n4 \n \nThe debriefing provided to the protester after the agency\u2019s initial source selection \ndecision in December  2024 discussed the agency\u2019s evaluation of MATCH SEC as part \nof the protester \u2019s--not PeopleTec\u2019s --proposal, stating that the agency had found the \ncontract to be \u201csimilar in scope and magnitude as [ Quantum ] managed a $77M task \norder as the managing partner of a Joint Venture[.]\u201d  Protest at  7.  As Quantum \u2019s \nproposal had not included any discussion of MATCH SEC, the protester raised concerns about the debr iefing statement in its follow- up questions.  Id.  at 8.

While we do not address each of the \nprotester\u2019s allegations and variations thereof, we have reviewed them all and concluded \nthat none provides a basis to sustain the protest.  \n3 In February  2024, t he protester and PeopleTec resolved  a lawsuit arising out of a \ndispute regarding PeopleTec\u2019s invocation of a \u201cshootout\u201d provision in CybEx \u2019s operating \nagreement allowing either member to require the other member to elect to buy or sell its ownership interest at a specified price.

AR, Tab 45, \nPrevious Protest at  9-10. \n As discussed above, we dismissed the previously -filed protest as academic after the \nagency indicated that it would take corrective action.  As part of that corrective action--which also included the reevaluation of proposals --the agency asked PeopleTec \nto answer the following questions:  \n \n1.  Was PeopleTec a participating member of the Cybex JV during the performance of the MATCH SEC Task Order?  2.  Did PeopleTec serve as a Task Order Lead for the MATCH SEC T ask \nOrder?  \n 3.  Did the MATCH SEC Task Order involve performance requirements which align to the RCCTO SETA Support TORP 24- 005 PWS paragraphs \n[DELETED] ? \n 4.  Did PeopleTec personnel perform on MATCH SEC [task order] requirements which map to each of these RCCTO SETA Support TORP 24-005 PWS paragraphs ( [DELETED] )? \n 5.

We need \nnot--and do not --wade into the morass of questions of semantics, corporate \ngovernance, and competing accounts that the parties have provided, however, as the record demonstrates that  the alleged misrepresentation did not have a significant \nimpact  on the evaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance.  \n PeopleTec\u2019s proposal included information regarding five efforts , two performed by \nPeopleTec and three performed respectively by its two proposed major subcontractors .  \nAR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3-7.  In conducting its \nreevaluation of proposals, t he agency first concluded that each of those efforts met the \nTORP\u2019s recency requirement.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation \nat 3-4.  After reviewing the scope, magnitude, and complexity of each effort, the agency \nassigned them the following relevancy ratings:  \n  Page 9    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Effort  Performing Entity  Relevancy Rating  \nReference No. 1 PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  \nMATCH SEC  PeopleTec  Somewhat Relevant  \nReference No. 3 Subcontractor 1  Somewhat Relevant  \nReference No. 4 Subcontractor 1  Relevant  \nReference No. 5 Subcontractor 2  Relevant  \n \nId. at 4-6. \n In assigning relevancy ratings, the agency noted that PeopleTec\u2019s first three references --including MATCH SEC--had annual values below $20 million,\n5 involved \nservices similar to  some of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and, while the first two involved the \nmanagement of subcontractors, they  did not involve the management of more than five \nsubcontractors.  Id. at 4-5.  Consequently, the agency concluded that these references  \ninvolved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP and assigned ratings of somewhat relevant to th em.  Id.  By contrast, the agency \nnoted that the remaining two references had annual values well in excess of $20 million, \ninvolved services similar to some or most of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and involved the management of substantially more than five subcontractors.  Id.  at 5-6.  The agency \ntherefore concluded that they involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities required by the TORP, assigning ratings of relevant to those references.  Id. \n The agency then assigned an overall relevancy rating of somewhat relevant, noting that because PeopleTec\u2019s proposed subcontractors had performed the fourth and fifth references , PeopleTec  itself did not possess any fully relevant past performance as a \nprime contractor.  Id. at 6.  Nevertheless, the agency concluded, PeopleTec\u2019s past \nefforts collectively \u201cspan[ned] the entirety of the RCCTO PWS\u201d and therefore merited a rating of somewhat relevant.  Id.  Because of \u201cprevious litigation invoking the MATCH \nSEC effort,\u201d i.e., the previously -filed protest, t he contracting officer  also \u201cconsidered \nwhether PeopleTec adequately demonstrated sufficient past performance without considering the MATCH SEC effort .\u201d  Id.  Excluding MATCH SEC, the contracting officer \nconcluded that  PeopleTec \u2019s proposal nevertheless  had demonstrated sufficient past \nperformance because of the collective experience shown by its other efforts.  Id. \n In assessing the quality of PeopleTec\u2019s performance, the agency queried CPARS to locate performance assessments  for each reference.  Id.  at 6-8.  Notably, there were \nmultiple performance assessments available for each of PeopleTec\u2019s references except for MATCH SEC, for which CPARS did not contain any assessments.  Id.   For that \n \n5 As discussed above, the agency\u2019s debriefing to the protester containing the mistaken \nreference to MATCH SEC characterized that task order as having a value of $77 million, \nbut PeopleTec\u2019s proposal and the agency\u2019s evaluation make clear that its annual value \nis $17.5 million.  See  AR, Tab 44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  3; Tab 55, \nPeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  5.  Page 10    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   effort, the only performance data available to the agency were statements from the \ncontracting officer\u2019s representative (COR)  in response to the agency\u2019s inquiry , who \nstated that CybEx  \u201cperformed well on the effort and there were no noted performance \nissues.\u201d  Id.  at 7.  The agency also reviewed all of the CPARS ratings for the previous \nfive years for PeopleTec and its proposed major subcontractors, finding no adverse information.  Id. at 8.  Considering all of the past performance information, the agency \ndetermined that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance, and \ntherefore assigned a rating of satisfactory confidence to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal.  Id.  \n The agency and intervenor contend, in part, that the agency\u2019s consideration of PeopleTec\u2019s performance on MATCH SEC did not have a significant impact upon the evaluation, and that the alleged misrepresentation therefore was not material .  MOL \nat 32-33; Supp. MOL at  37-46; Intervenor Comments at  6-7; Intervenor Supp. \nComments at  4-5.  On the record before us, we agree.   As an initial matter, the agency \nconcluded that MATCH SEC, like all four of the other references, met the TORP\u2019s recency requirements, and i ts relevancy rating of somewhat relevant is the same \nassigned to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal overall under the past performance factor.  MATCH SEC also  was similar to the other two references the agency found to be somewhat \nrelevant in that all three references had annual values below $20 million, involved \nservices similar to some , but not most or all,  of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and did not \ninvolve the management of more than five subcontractors.  \n The record also reflects that the agency considered MATCH SEC to be less relevant than the two references found to be relevant , which  had annual values over  $20 million, \ninvolved services similar to some or most of the PWS\u2019s requirements, and involved the \nmanagement of more than five subcontractors.   Furthermore, the crosswalk contained \nin PeopleTec\u2019s proposal shows that, for each PWS paragraph to which MATCH SEC mapped, at least one other reference also mapped to that paragraph.  See  AR, Tab  44, \nPeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9.  Thus, when viewed in context of all of \nPeopleTec\u2019s past performance efforts, the record demonstrates that the agency\u2019s consideration of MATCH SEC likely neither raised nor lowered the overall relevancy \nrating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal.  \n Additionally, as noted above, the agency was able to review multiple CPARS assessments for each of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance references, with the lone exception of MATCH SEC.  The overwhelming majority of the ratings for those assessments, which covered multiple performance periods, are either very good or \nexceptional.  See  AR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  6-8.  In \ncontrast, the only information available to the agency regarding PeopleTec\u2019s performance on MATCH SEC was the COR\u2019s short , general  statement that CybEx  had \nperformed well and that there were no noted performance issues.  Thus, there was substantially more performance information available to the agency regarding the non-MATCH SEC efforts, including multiple positive performance assessments \nregarding more relevant efforts.  \n  Page 11    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In assigning a satisfactory confidence rating to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal, the agency noted \nthat PeopleTec \u201chas presented somewhat relevant past performance information and there is clear demonstration of the offeror\u2019s ability and its major subcontractor[s\u2019] ability to perform somewhat similar work successfully through various CPARS  [assessments] .\u201d  \nId. at 8.  In light of the evaluation finding that MATCH SEC was only somewhat relevant \nto the TORP\u2019s requirements , the duplication in other references\u2019 relevance t o the PWS \nrequirements,  and the limited performance information regarding MATCH SEC that was \navailable to the agency, that would remain a reasonable conclusion even if MATCH SEC were to be removed from the agency\u2019s consideration, as the record of the evaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s other past performance efforts wholly supports the agency\u2019s \nevaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance .  Additionally, the agency\u2019s comparison of \nthe technical merits of the two proposals does not discuss MATCH SEC at all.  See  AR, \nTab 63, TODD at  30-31. \n On this record, we therefore conclude that the agency\u2019s consideration of MATCH SEC \nhad no significant impact  on the agency\u2019s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating \nto PeopleTec\u2019s proposal.

Competitive \nprejudice is an essential element of every viable protest.  Computer World Servs. Corp. , \nB-421495.2, Dec.  6, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 280 at  7.  Where the protester fails to \ndemonstrate that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have a substantial chance of receiving an award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Id.  at 7-8.  As discussed above, we conclude that the agency\u2019s \nconsideration of MATCH SEC had no significant impact  on the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nPeopleTec\u2019s  past performance.  Thus, to whatever extent the protester\u2019s prior \nallegations of material misrepresentation warranted a more searching inquiry than that performed by the agency, the protester cannot demonstrate any reasonable probability of prejudice aris ing out of the agency\u2019s failure to seek more information than that \ngleaned through its questions.\n6  We therefore deny this ground of protest as well.  \n \n6 While the protester contends that the agency should have disqualified PeopleTec from \nthe competition prior to the reevaluation conducted as part of the agency\u2019s corrective \naction, see Protest at  10; Comments & Supp. Protest at  7; Supp. Comments at  4, our \ndecisions have concluded that \u201cthe mere fact that an agency identified a \nmisrepresentation that it believes had a material influence on the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals does not obligate the agency to disqualify\u201d the offeror.

Management and Tech. Servs. \nAlliance Joint Venture, B -422786 et al. , Nov.  6, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 264 at  5.  A \nprotester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment does not establish that a n \nevaluation w as unreasonable.  Id.  \n The protester first contends that the agency improperly assigned relevancy ratings of somewhat relevant to the two references in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal performed by PeopleTec itself.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  17-21.  The protester argues that \nbecause the TORP defined \u201crelevant\u201d in terms of criteria the agency would use to assess similarity of scope, magnitude, and complexity, it set minimum requirements  that \nhad to be met in order to merit a rating other than \u201cnot relevant.\u201d   Thus, for example, the \nprotest er contends that the rating of somewhat relevant assigned to PeopleTec\u2019s first \npast performance reference was improper because, as the agency concluded, it  \n(i) involve d the management of five--i.e., not more than five--subcontractors  in \nperforming similar requirements; and (ii) ha d an annual value of $7.68 million --i.e., less \nthan $20 million .  Id. at 17-18.  The agency responds that, under a plain reading, the \nTORP did not establish minimum criteria for relevance, and the agency\u2019s assignment of somewhat relevant ratings was reasonable and in accordance with the TORP, as the references had some similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to the solicited requirement.  Supp. MOL at  53-56. \n The protester\u2019s argument rests upon an unreasonable reading of the TORP.  While the TORP laid out criteria against which the agency would evaluate past performance references for relevance, it also provided for the assessment of relevance on a scale.   \nThus, a reference involving \u201csome of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires\u201d would merit  a rating of somewhat relevant  under \nthe TORP\u2019s terms , while a reference involving \u201csimilar scope and magnitude of effort \nand complex ities this solicitation requires\u201d would merit a rating of relevant.  To find, as \nthe protester urges, that the TORP\u2019s criteria for scope, magnitude, and complexity were minimum requirements , a reference meeting all of those putatively minimum \nrequirements necessarily would merit a rating of relevant, as it would involve \u201csimilar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities\u201d  as those terms are defined in the  Page 13    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   TORP,  not \u201csome of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities.\u201d  In that way, \nthe protester\u2019s argument  would read the rating of somewhat relevant out of the TORP \u2019s \nrelevance scale, and therefore is not a reasonable reading of the TORP.  See, e.g. , ICF \nInc., L.L.C., B -421850 et al. , Nov.  7, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 254 at  7 (\u201cWhere a protester \nand agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the \nmatter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.\u201d).   \nWe therefore deny this ground of protest.\n7 \n \nThe protester next alleges that the agency\u2019s consideration of additional CPARS \nassessments for efforts beyond those submitted in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal was improper, \nas the agency made no determination that those efforts were relevant to the instant \nrequirem ent.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-30.  The record reflects, however, that \nthe only conclusion the agency drew from its review of those performance assessments  \nwas that there was \u201cno adverse information\u201d with respect to PeopleTec or its proposed major subcontractors.  AR, Tab 55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8.  \nThus, the agency\u2019s consideration of the additional CPARS assessments did not have the effect of improving PeopleTec\u2019s past performance evaluation; rather, the record \nreflects that the agency only confirmed the absence of negative performance information.   Accordingly, to whatever extent the agency erred in not determining the \nrelevance of these efforts, the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prejudice arising from that alleged error.   We therefore deny this protest allegation as \nwell. \n \nFinally, the protester contends that the agency\u2019s assignment of a rating of satisfactory \nconfidence to PeopleTec\u2019s proposal was unreasonable because it was based upon the agency\u2019s conclusion that PeopleTec\u2019s past efforts collectively spanned the R CCTO \nSETA PWS, which the protester argues is not supported by the crosswalk contained in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal .  Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-35.  The TORP\u2019s instructions \nrequired offerors to \u201ccrosswalk to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PWS\u201d --i.e., \nparagr aph 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and so forth.   Amended TORP at  9.  PeopleTec\u2019s proposal \nincluded that crosswalk, see AR, Tab  44, PeopleTec Past Performance Proposal at  8-9, \nbut as the protester points out, it does not tie any past performance reference to eight out of the 58 third- level paragraphs, Comments & Supp. Protest at  30-32.\n8  \n \n7 Because the protester has not advanced a reasonable reading of the solicitation, we \nsimilarly deny its allegation that the TORP was latently ambiguous as to whether the relevance criteria were minimum requirements.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 23-24; ICF, supra at 7 (\u201cAn ambiguity exists were two or more reasonable \ninterpretations of the terms or specifications of the solicitation are possible.\u201d).  \n8 The protester further contends that, if the two references performed by PeopleTec \nwere removed, that number would grow to 17.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  32-34.  As \ndiscussed above, however, we conclude that the agency reasonably considered those references in its evaluation of PeopleTec\u2019s past performance.   Page 14    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   Consequently, the protester contends, the agency\u2019s assignment of a satisfactory \nconfidence rating rests upon an erroneous foundation.  \n The contracting officer states --and the protester agrees --that the TORP \u201chad no stated \nminimum threshold in [the] number of third level paragraphs any offeror was required to meet.\u201d  Supp. COS at  9; Supp. Comments at  25.  While the agency\u2019s response does not \nsquarely meet the gravamen of the protester\u2019s argument --that the agency unreasonably \ndetermined, based on the crosswalk in PeopleTec\u2019s proposal, that PeopleTec\u2019s past efforts collectively spanned the PWS\u2019s requirement s--it highlights the distinction our  \nOffice has recognized between instructions and evaluation criteria.  \n We previously have concluded that information provided in a solicitation\u2019s instructions to offerors section is not the same as evaluation criteria detailed in a solicitation\u2019s evaluation section.

In this regard, rather than establishing minimum evaluation standards, a \nsolicitation\u2019s instructions to offerors section generally provides guidance to assist offerors in preparing and organizing their proposal s.  STAcqMe , supra at 5.  The \ninformation required by the instructions does not have to correspond to the evaluation criteria.  University Rsch. , supra at 18. \n Here, while the TORP\u2019s instructions directed offerors to crosswalk their past performance references to the third level of paragraph 2.0 of the PW S, its evaluation \ncriteria were silent as to how the agency would assess the breadth of an offeror\u2019s past performance.  See  Amended TORP at  18-19.  Thus, as the contracting officer points \nout, the TORP did not require that an offeror demonstrate past performance for each of the third- level paragraphs.  More saliently, though, because the TORP did not require \nsuch a demonstration, we conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the  \nagency\u2019s conclusion that PeopleTec\u2019s \u201ccollective [p]ast [p]erformance record with available assessments covers the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS .\u201d  \nAR, Tab  55, PeopleTec Past Performance Evaluation at  8. \n Paragraph 2.0 of the PWS contained eight substantive paragraphs at the second level, \nstarting at paragraph 2.1 and concluding with paragraph 2.8, each covering a category \nof services such as program management services or financial management services, and each also containing several third- level paragraphs  discussing more granular tasks \nwithin  those services .  See Amended PWS at  10-28.  PeopleTec\u2019s crosswalk tied past \nperformance references to all of the third- level paragraphs within paragraphs  2.1 to 2.4 \nand 2.7 to 2.8.  The missing third- level paragraphs fall within paragraphs  2.5 and 2.6.  \nWithin those paragraphs, however, PeopleTec\u2019s crosswalk provides references for seven out of the 10 third- level paragraphs within paragraph 2.5, and 11 out of the 16 \nthird-level paragraphs within paragraph 2.6.  Thus, with respect to the missing \nthird-level paragraphs, PeopleTec\u2019s proposal nevertheless demonstrates past \nperformance covering a majority of the tasks contained within the services to which the PWS relates t hose tasks.  \n  Page 15    B-423237.2; B -423237.3   In demonstrating experience with the entirety of the tasks contemplated by paragraphs \n2.1 to 2.4 and 2.7 to 2.8, as well as a clear majority of the tasks contemplated by \nparagraphs 2.5 and 2.6, PeopleTec\u2019s crosswalk does \u201ccover[] the entire service requirements of the RCCTO PWS [,]\u201d as the agency concluded in its evaluation.   \nAdditionally, the breadth of successful past performance demonstrated by PeopleTec\u2019s proposal is consistent with the agency\u2019s conclusion that it had a reasonable expectation of successful performance here.  The assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating therefore is consistent with the TO RP\u2019s definition for that rating.  Consequently, the \nrecord contradicts the protester\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s assignment of a satisfactory confidence rating rests upon a faulty factual basis.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  \n Best-Value Tradeoff  \n Lastly, the protester challenges the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff, contending that it was \nbased upon a flawed evaluation, failed to adequately document tradeoffs, and improperly minimized technical differences between the proposals and instead focused on cost\/ price, thereby departing from the TORP\u2019s tradeoff basis of award.

MOL at  41-45; Supp. MOL at  77-89. \n As an initial matter, the protester\u2019s argument that the best -value determination is \nunreasonable relies on the protester\u2019s various challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation, which we have denied for the reasons stated above.

Servs., LLC , B-419976.2, May  2, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6  104 at  5). \n In contending that the agency improperly minimized the differences between the proposals, the protester primarily points to the TODD\u2019s discussion of the protester\u2019s incumbent advantage afforded by its proposal to use the incumbent contractor as a major subcontractor and the resulting commitments from experienced personnel.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  38-41.  The protester argues that the agency cited an \noffsetting strength of PeopleTec\u2019s proposal to minimize the protester\u2019s advantage under the past perform ance factor, thereby inflating the importance of cost\/price to the \nagency\u2019s best -value determination and effectively converting the basis of award to \nlowest -price, technically acceptable.  Id.   On our review of the record, we do not discern \na basis to sustain this ground of protest.   Page 16    B-423237.2; B -423237.3    \nIn comparing the two proposals, the agency noted the continuity benefits of the protester\u2019s major subcontractor.  AR, Tab 63, TODD at  30-31.  This discussion aligned \nwith a strength identified in the evaluation of the protester\u2019s proposal under the task execution factor, which noted that the protester had \u201ccommitments from incumbent \nsubcontractor team employees for 60 [percent]  of the total base year hours,\u201d and \nrecogniz ed the benefit that the protester\u2019s approach \u201cprovides an experienced workforce \nwith an understanding of RCCTO requirements and challenges[.]\u201d  Id.  at 22.  The \nagency further noted, however, that PeopleTec\u2019s proposal had a similar strength under the task execution factor, based on its \u201c [DELETED]  as part of its plan to maintain the \ncurrent workforce.\u201d  Id. at 18.  See also id. at 30-31 (discus sing the offsetting strengths).  \n The protester contends that the agency improperly considered these offsetting strengths with respect to the past performance factor, not the task execution factor, thereby minimizing the protester\u2019s advantage under the former.  While the TODD \u2019s comparative \nanalysis  does somewhat inartfully intermingle discussion of these strengths with its \ndiscussion of past performance, it also discusses \u201cany benefits related to incumbency\u201d within the context of \u201cother aspects of the [t]ask [e]xecution [f]actor ,\u201d in which \nPeopleTec\u2019s proposal \u201cpresent[ed] more strengths and the use of certain tools and approaches, the benefits of which are not replicated in [the protester\u2019s proposal].\u201d   Id. \nat 31.  That is consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals under the task \nexecution factor.   See id. at 17-18, 21- 22 (documenting assignment of strengths under \nthat factor).   The TODD further recognizes the superiority of the protester\u2019s proposal \nunder the qualifications and experience and past performance factors, while concluding that the overall superiority of the protester\u2019s proposal --driven by advantages in the two \ncomparatively less important non- cost\/price factors --did not justify the \u201csignificant \ncost\/price premium\u201d associated with the protester\u2019s proposal.  Id.  at 33.  Thus, the \nrecord does not support the protester\u2019s contention that the agency improperly minimized the advantages of its proposal under the past performance factor.  We therefore deny this ground of protest.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

Protest challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s proposal is denied where the record demonstrates that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and in accordance with the solicitation\u2019s terms.  \n 2.  Protest challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s proposal is denied where the record demonstrates that the majority of the  agency\u2019s evaluation was \nreasonable and in accordance with the solicitation\u2019s terms, and the protester cannot \notherwise demonstrate competitive prejudice arising from a single allegedly overlooked \nstrength.  \nDECISION  \n NexGen Data Systems, Inc., a small business of North Charleston, South Carolina, \nprotests the issuance of a task order to Modus21, LLC, a small business also of North \nCharleston, South Carolina, under request for proposals (RFP) No.  N6523624R3020, \nissued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Information Warfare Center Atlantic, for information technology  (IT) support services.  The protester contends that the agency \nimproperly evaluated proposals and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  \nresulting from that improper evaluation.  We deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   BACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the RFP on September  17, 2024, pursuant to the procedures in \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5, to firms holding the Navy\u2019s \nSeaPort -Next Generation indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at  3.  The RFP, \nwhich the agency amended twice, was set aside for small businesses and sought proposals for the provision of IT, network, planning, architectural analysis, evaluation, design, development, engineering, transition, cyber security, programmatic, and sustainment support services.  Id.  at 3-4; Agency Report (AR) Tab 3, RFP at  8.  A \nprimary focus of the services to be provided is the transition from a mostly Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hosting methodology --which meets business process needs through \non-premises data center hosting- -to commercial cloud hosting environments including \nIaaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.  RFP at 9. \n The RFP contemplated issuance of a single, cost -plus-fixed -fee, level -of-effort task \norder with a 12- month base period and four , 12-month options.  Id.  at 2, 101.  The total \nlevel of effort across all 60 months of performance is 1,787,550 labor hours.  Id. at 4; \nCOS\/MOL at 3.  The agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal \nwas determined to be the technically superior proposal with a fair and reasonable cost\/price.  RFP at  147.  The agency would determine technical superiority on the basis \nof three factors:  technical capability ; technical understanding;  and staffing plan.  Id. \nat 147-149.  Only the technical capability and technical understanding factors are \nrelevant here.  \n Under the technical capability factor, offerors were to submit information regarding at least one, and no more than five, examples of corporate experience.  Id. at 141.  The \nRFP required offerors to submit at least one reference performed by the offeror and at least one reference performed by any significant subcontractor, a term the RFP defined as a subcontractor or any subsidiary or separate legal entity affiliated with the offeror that was proposed to perform at least 20 percent (without rounding) of the total \nproposed labor hours.  Id.   The RFP stated that the agency would evaluate only \nreferences performed by either the offeror or a significant subcontractor, and that any other reference data would not be considered.  Id.   The RFP  further  stated that \u201c[o]nly \ncontract references that are determined to be current and relevant will be evaluated.\u201d  Id. at 149.  The RFP defined \u201ccurrent\u201d as having been performed within the last three \nyears from the date of RFP issuance, and \u201crelevant\u201d as being \u201csimilar to the requirements of [the] RFP.\u201d  Id. at 141. \n The RFP provided that the agency would evaluate proposals under the technical capability factor considering three elements, referred to as elements A1, A2, and A3:  \n \nElement A1:  Demonstrate experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud at Impact Level 4.  Taking into consideration AWS best practices and cloud  service manager requirements, demonstrate  Page 3    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, \nadministration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with [Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)] Provisional Authorizations (PA).  Experience supporting a cloud broker in the \ndevelopment and delivery of self -service capabilities in support of hosted \nsystems is considered more valuable to the Government.  \n Element A2:   Demonstrate experience providing sustainment services \nconsisting of Network, Compute, Storage, Virtualization, Operating Systems, Domain Services, Remote Access, Backup, and off -site Disaster \nRecovery, for at least one on- premises enterprise datacenter.  Describe \nthe manning that was required and the environment size in terms of scope of responsibility for the full stack and the virtual server count.  Experience sustaining a hybrid on -premises\/commercial cloud environment is \nconsidered more val uable to the Government.  \n Element A3:  Demonstrate experience accomplishing business process re-engineering through modernizing either a client -server, or an n- tier, \nsoftware -based system to take advantage of commercial cloud offerings of \nnative services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.  Experience using code deployment pipelines as part of the software development lifecycle is considered more valuable to the Government.  \n \nId. at 148. \n \nWith respect to the technical understanding factor, the RFP directed offerors to \n\u201cdemonstrate[] their technical understanding of the [performance work statement] \nrequirements by providing a detailed description of the processes and procedures proposed to accomplish the tasks, while minimizing performance risk[.]\u201d  Id. at 142.  In \nparticular, offerors were to describe, and the agency would evaluate,  their approaches \nto two elements, referred to as elements B1 and B2:  \n \nElement B1:  Ensuring compliance with Naval Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidelines and including the special needs of containerized workloads, describe your approach for implementing automation into an existing manual continuous monitoring and artifact generation process to enable the reduction in personnel required to support Common Control Provider[\n1] (not hosted system level) RMF \nAuthorizations to Operate (ATO), and to maintain operational Cyber Security compliance, for both on- premises data centers and commercial \ncloud brokerages.  \n \n \n1 The RFP defined \u201cCommon Control Provider\u201d as \u201can organization official responsible \nfor the development, implementation, assessment and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by hosted information systems).\u201d  RFP at  142.  Page 4    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Element B2:  Describe the innovative techniques you would use to \nperform cost- effectiveness optimization of Navy on- premises workloads \nmoving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems already running in a commercial cloud, taking into account modernization opportuniti es, system \navailability, [and] security, with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.  \n \nId. at 149. \n The RFP provided that the agency would assess technical understanding based upon offerors \u2019 \u201ctechnical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their \ndescriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements.\u201d  Id.  It advised that proposals \u201cthat \ndemonstrate understanding by increasing efficiencies, and\/or minimiz e performance risk \nare more valuable to the agency.\u201d  Id.  It further stated that the agency would evaluate \nthe extent to which proposals \u201cdemonstrate[] understanding and clearly, completely, and accurately describe[] the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully resolve the .  . . tasks described in the elements.\u201d  Id. \n The agency received 14 timely proposals in response to the RFP, including from the \nprotester and Modus21.  COS\/MOL at  4.  Following a compliance review, the agency \nrejected two proposals prior to evaluation.  Id.   One of those rejections was the subject \nof a previous protest filed with our Office, which we dismissed as academic  after the \nagency stated that it would consider and evaluate the proposal.  See  OSC Edge , \nB-423209, Dec.  12, 2024 (unpublished decision).  \n As discussed further below, the agency assigned various strengths and weaknesses to the proposals, resulting in the following adjectival ratings for the proposals submitted by  \nthe protester and Modus21:  \n \n NexGen  Modus21  \nTECHNICAL CAPABILITY  Outstanding  Outstanding  \nTECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING  Acceptabl e Good  \nSTAFFING PLAN  Outstanding  Outstanding  \n AR, Tab  5, Selection Evaluation Board (SEB) Report at  6; Tab 6, Source Selection \nDecision Document (SSDD) at  5. \n In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that the protester\u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor, but that Modus21\u2019s proposal was \u201ctechnically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s proposal under the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  The \nagency further concluded that Modus21\u2019s proposal was \u201ctechnically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s proposal under the staffing plan factor.  Id. at 16.  On the basis of that \ncomparison, the agency determined Modus21\u2019s proposal to be \u201cslightly technically \nsuperior \u201d to NexGen\u2019s proposal.  Id.  at 19.  The agency further concluded that  Page 5    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21\u2019s total evaluated cost of $215,280,363 was reasonable and realistic, and \ntherefore that the agency would issue the task order to Modus21 under the RFP\u2019s \ntechnically superior, fair and reasonable cost\/price evaluation method.  Id.  at 20.  This \nprotest followed.2 \n DISCUSSION  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor, unreasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s proposal under the technical understanding factor, and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  based upon an improper evaluation.\n3  We have reviewed the protester\u2019s \narguments and conclude that none provides us with a basis to sustain the protest .4 \n \nWhere an agency conducts a competition among contractors for the issuance of a task \nor delivery order under part  16 of the FAR, our Office will review the competition to \nensure that it was conducted in accordance with the solicitation and applicable procur ement laws and regulations.  Sudofy LLC , B-422604 et al. , Aug.  16, 2024, \n2024 CPD \u00b6 195 at  5.  In reviewing protests of awards in a task order competition, we \ndo not reevaluate proposals but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the \nsolicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  Id.  \n \nTechnical Capability Factor  \n \nThe protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21\u2019s references \nunder the technical capability factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-19; Supp. \nComments at  3-10.  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated Modus21\u2019s \nproposal in accordance with the RFP\u2019s terms.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL)  \nat 5-14.  As discussed below, we discern no basis to sustain the protest with respect to \nthe evaluation of Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor.  \n \n \n2 As the value of the issued task order exceeds $35 million, this protest is within our \njurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ \ncontracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7  3406(f)(1)(B ). \n3 The protester initially challenged the agency\u2019s evaluation of Modus21\u2019s proposal under \nthe staffing plan factor, see Protest at  31-34, but withdrew that allegation, see \nComments & Supp. Protest at  31. \n4 The protester also raises various collateral arguments.  Although we do not address \nevery argument, we have reviewed them all and find no basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21\u2019s proposal included four references under the technical capability factor, one \nperformed by Modus21 and three by its subcontractor, [SUBCONTRACTOR] .5  AR, \nTab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  3, 6.  The agency \u2019s evaluation contains a detailed \ndiscussion of the experience demonstrated by each reference, as well as a determination that each of those references was both current and relevant.  AR, Tab 5, \nSEB Report at  72-75.  In evaluating Modus21\u2019s proposal, the agency assigned a \nsignificant strength under element A3, as well as three strengths, one under each element of the factor.  Id.  at 75-76; AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6-8.  The agency also assigned \ntwo weaknesses to Modus21\u2019s proposal, one under each of element s A1 and A2.  AR, \nTab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6-7. \n On the basis of the evaluation, the agency concluded that NexGen\u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to Modus21\u2019s under the technical capability factor.  AR, \nTab 6, SSDD at  14.  While the protester\u2019s proposal --like Modus21\u2019s proposal --had \nreceived one significant strength and three strengths, it had not received any \nweaknesses.  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  88-89; Tab 6, SSDD at  13-14.  The agency did, \nhowever, assign two weaknesses to Modus21\u2019s proposal and concluded these \nweaknesses introduced \u201cnom inal risk,\u201d thereby narrowing the technical advantages of \nthe protester\u2019s proposal.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14. \n \nThe protester contends that the agency improperly assigned a significant strength to \nModus21\u2019s proposal.  The record reflects that the agency assigned a significant strength \nwith respect to element A3, which asked offerors to \u201c[d]emonstrate experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through modernizing either a \nclient -server, or an n- tier, software -based system to take advantage of commercial \ncloud offerings of native services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.\u201d  A R, Tab 5, SEB Report at  76; \nTab 6, SSDD at  8; RFP at  148.  This significant strength was based upon two of \nModus21\u2019s references:  one performed by Modus21 and one by [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  \nAR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76.  Specifically, the agency noted that Modus21\u2019s proposal \n\u201cdemonstrate[d] experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through the \nuse of cloud native services across all of IaaS, PaaS[,] and SaaS[,]\u201d whereas the \n \n5 The protester contends that the agency improperly considered [SUBCONTRACTOR] \u2019s \nreferences, arguing that Modus21 did not propose [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to perform at \nleast 20 percent of the total proposed labor hours as the RFP required to qualify as a \nsignificant subcontractor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  3-4; Supp. Comments at  2-3.  \nThe protester\u2019s argument , however,  relies on extrapolation from Modus21\u2019s staffing \nplan--in which offerors were to list individuals proposed for ten positions accounting for \nonly 19,200 of the first year of performance\u2019s 357,510 labor hours , see RFP at  143, \n226-227--as well as rounding, in contravention of the RFP\u2019s directive that whether a \nsubcontractor was \u201csignificant\u201d was to be determined without rounding.  Moreover, as reflected in Modus21\u2019s cost\/price proposal, Modus21 proposed [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to \nperform [DELETED] --over 20 percent --of the total proposed 1,787,550 labor hours.  AR, \nTab 14, Modus21 Pricing Model at  3.  The record therefore refutes the protester\u2019s \ncontention that [SUBCONTRACTOR]  does not qualify as a significant subcontractor \nwhose corporate experience was to be considered under the RFP\u2019s terms.   Page 7    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   element asked offerors to demonstrate the use of only one of those solutions.  Id.   The \nagency concluded that the demonstration of experience across all of the available \nservice areas would aid in modernization efforts, and that knowledge of PaaS and SaaS solutions was relevant to the provision of services that could greatly reduce labor overhead for maintenance.  Id.  \n The protester raises two separate challenges to the assignment of this significant \nstrength.  First, the protester contends that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign it based upon the reference performed by Modus21, as that  reference reflected only \nfour months of performance as a subcontractor on a contract valued at approximately $10 million.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-8.  Second, the protester argues that \nModus21\u2019s proposal does not reflect that the reference performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR]  demonstrated business process re- engineering through the use \nof a SaaS solution.  Id.  at 14-16. \n With respect to the protester\u2019s first argument, the record of the agency\u2019s evaluation is clear that this significant strength was not based solely on the reference performed by Modus21; rather, it was based upon both references.  See  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76 \n(citing both references\n6).  Thus, to whatever extent the reference performed by \nModus21 does not, on its own, support the assignment of a significant strength, the record refutes the foundational premise of the protester\u2019s argument , i.e., that it was \nunreasonable to assign a significant strength based only upon four months of \nperformance as a subcontractor on a comparatively lower -valued effort .  The protester \ndoes not dispute that the reference demonstrated experience across all three of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Where the element asked offerors to demonstrate experience with \nonly one of those categories of solutions, it was not unreasonable for t he agency to find \nthat this experience, when combined with further experience across those solutions, \nhad appreciable merit or exceeded requirements to the considerable advantage of the \ngovernment.  \n The record, as clarified by the agency, also refutes the protester\u2019s second argument.  \nThe protester contends that Modus21\u2019s proposal states that the reference performed by \n[SUBCONTRACTOR]  involved only PaaS and IaaS, not SaaS .  See  Comments & Supp. \nProtest at  15 (quoting statement in Modus21\u2019s proposal that \u201cTeaM21 implemented \n[DELETED]  on the [DELETED]  commercial cloud brokerage, thereby enabling \n[DELETED]  to utilize cloud -native services, PaaS, and IaaS from [DELETED] , \n[DELETED] , and [DELETED] \u201d).\n7  Thus, the protester contends, it was unreasonable for \n \n6 The SEB report mistakenly refers to the reference performed by \n[SUBCONTRACTOR] --which is the fourth and final reference submitted by Modus21--\nas \u201cCR [(contract reference)] 5,\u201d but the accompanying page number reference to Modus21\u2019s proposal makes clear that the agency was considering contract reference 4.  \nSee AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76. \n7 The protester also alleges that, by referring to \u201cTeaM21\u201d in describing work performed \nin its technical capability references, Modus21\u2019s proposal contains material \n(continued...)   Page 8    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   the agency to find that  this reference also  demonstrated  experience with all three of \nIaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  \n \nAs described in Modus21\u2019s proposal, this reference involves [SUBCONTRACTOR] \u2019s \nsupport of [DELETED] , \u201can enterprise- level digital transformation\u201d that applies \u201ccloud \ncomputing, [PaaS], [IaaS], .  . . and SaaS in support of cloud- native application \narchitectures.\u201d  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  14.  The proposal further discusses \n[SUBCONTRACTOR] \u2019s integration of [DELETED]  and [DELETED]  into [DELETED] \u2019s \ncode development pipeline.  Id.   As explained by the agency, [DELETED]  \u201cis recognized \nto be a SaaS solution.\u201d  Supp. MOL at  14.  The protester does not rebut  this \ncharacterization.  See generally  Supp. Comments.   Thus, it was not unreasonable for \nthe agency to conclude that this reference involved IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Nor was it unreasonable for the agency to conclude that this reference, when combined with the reference performed by Modus21, demonstrated a breadth of experience meriting the \nassignment of a significant strength.  This allegation therefore provides no basis to sustain the protest.  \n The protester also challenges the agency\u2019s conclusion that the weaknesses assigned to Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor presented nominal risk.  In that regard, the agency assigned a weakness under element A1, which sought experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, administration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with DISA PA s.  AR, Tab  5, SEB \n \nmisrepresentations suggesting that Modus21 and its subcontractors performed references that were, in fact, performed by either Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  \nalone.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  6-7, 10, 13- 14, 15- 16; Supp. Comments at  5-6, 7, \n8-9, 10.  The protester argues that these misrepresentations render the assignment of \nstrengths improper and should have resulted in the disqualification of Modus21 from the \ncompetition.  Id. \nModus21\u2019s proposal, however, clearly identifies its technical capability references as being performed by Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  See  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 \nProposal at  3 (identifying Modus21 as the performing contractor), 6 (identifying \n[SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor).  Additionally, the agency\u2019s \nevaluation identifies Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractors.  \nSee AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  72 (stating that \u201cModus21 and its significant \nsubcontractor ( [SUBCONTRACTOR] ) submitted a total of four (4) contract references\u201d \nand identifying Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor for each \nreference).  Thus, the proposal does not contain misrepresentations, and the record demonstrates that, to whatever extent the proposal\u2019s references to \u201cTeaM21\u201d might rise to the level of misrepresentations, the agency \u2019s evaluation did not rel y on those alleged \nmisrepresentations.  We therefore deny this allegation.  See, e.g. , Avar Consulting, Inc. , \nB-417668.3 et al. , June 10, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 191 at  9-10 (denying allegation of \nmaterial misrepresentation regarding experience and past performance where the statements did not amount to misrepresentations and the agency did not rely upon them).   Page 9    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6; RFP at  148.  The agency concluded that Modus21\u2019s \nsecond technical capability reference--performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR] --did not \ndemonstrate experience performing common maintenance tasks within AWS GovCloud \nor performance tuning utilizing services with DISA PAs and assigned a weakness on that basis.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The agency further \nconcluded, however, that the risks associated with this weakness were nominal, as the proposal discussed experience with monitoring services that support performance tuning services, as well as having realized benefits of performance tuning such as reducing hosting, development, and migration costs.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The \nagency also found that the proposal demonstrated experience with common AWS administration items and a knowledge of AWS services with DISA PAs, thereby reducing the risks associated with the lack of experience with maintenance.  Id.  \n The protester argues that, because the RFP sought experience with maintenance and performance tuning, it did not permit the agency to make a determination beyond its conclusion that Modus21\u2019s proposal failed to demonstrate experience with those tasks.\n8  \nComments & Supp. Protest at  9-10; Supp. Comments at  6-7.  In other words, the \nprotester contends that the agency was permitted only to make a binary evaluation decision based upon whether the proposal did or did not demonstrate the requested experience.  We disagree.  \n The RFP did request a demonstration of experience with certain tasks under element A2, and the record reflects that the agency assigned a weakness for failure to demonstrate some of that experience.  The analysis regarding the risk associated with \nthat weakness, however, reflects a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of that risk.  \nIn that regard, the agency concluded that, while Modus21\u2019s proposal failed to \ndemonstrate some of  the requested experience, it did demonstrate experience with \nother, related tasks that lessened the risk associated with lack of demonstrated experience with maintenance and performance tuning.  The protester expresses only disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment regarding the degree to which the risks introduced by lack of experi ence were mitigated by other experience demonstrated in \nthe proposal.  Without more, the protester\u2019s argument does not show that the agency\u2019s \n \n8 The protester also contends that, because the agency found that Modus21\u2019s proposal \nfailed to demonstrate experience with two tasks listed under element A2, it was unreasonable for the agency to assign only one weakness, rather than two.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  9; Supp. Comments at  7.  As we consistently have stated, the \nassignment of adjectival ratings and the source selection generally should not be based \nupon a simple count of strengths and weaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals.  Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec.  18, 2019, 2020 CPD \u00b6 8 \nat 4 (citing National Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. , B-412142, Dec.  30, 2015, 2016 CPD \u00b6 8 at 15; \nEpsilon Sys. Sols., Inc. , B-409720, B -409720.2, July  21, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 230 at  8).  \nHere, the record reflects that the agency identified and qualitatively considered the demonstrated lack of experience with both the maintenance and performance tuning tasks.  Accordingly, whether that lack of experience was labeled a single or multiple weaknesses is immaterial.   Page 10    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   evaluation was unreasonable.  See  Sparksoft Corp. , B-420944.4, June 2, 2023, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 155 at  11-12 (evaluation was reasonable where the agency concluded that \na weakness for lack of experience was mitigated by demonstration of related \nexperience).   We therefore deny this protest allegation.  \n For similar reasons, we deny the protester\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that the weakness assigned to Modus21\u2019s proposal under element A3 presented nominal risk.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest at  12-13; Supp. Comments at  8.  The \nrecord reflects that the agency found that the weakness --assigned for not demonstrating \nexperience with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center --was mitigated \nby demonstrated experi ence supporting two private cloud data centers and managing \nthe VMWare virtual enterprise, which the agency concluded \u201cwould have been on a compute environment.\u201d  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  7.  While the agency found that the \nproposal lacked details as to the nature of the compute infrastructure supported, the experience related to the element\u2019s compute sustainment task and thereby reduced the risk associated with the lack of demonstrated experience specifically with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center.  Id.   We therefore deny this protest \nallegation as well.  \n Technical Understanding Factor  \n Next, the protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of its proposal under the technical understanding factor, alleging that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness and failed to assign multiple strengths.  We find no basis to sustain the \nprotest.  \n \nWeakness Assigned to the Protester\u2019s Proposal  \n \nThe agency assigned a weakness to the protester\u2019s proposal under the technical understanding factor with respect to element B2, which sought a description of \u201cthe innovative techniques [the offeror] would use to perform cost -effectiveness optimization \nof Navy on- premises workloads moving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems \nalready running in a commercial cloud, .  . . with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud \nspend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.\u201d  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report \nat 92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15; RFP at  149.  The agency found that while the protester\u2019s \nproposal discussed actions to optimize costs of cloud- operating systems, it did not \ndiscuss or demonstrate an understanding of balancing cloud costs and labor required to sustain the system over time.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  \nThe agency expressed concern that a lack of understanding of how to cost -optimize a \nsystem in a way that balances cloud costs and sustainment labor posed cost risks to the agency, and therefore assigned a weakness to the proposal.  Id.  \n The protester first alleges that the agency assigned this weakness on the basis of an unstated evaluation criterion, contending that the RFP did not advise offerors that the agency would consider the extent to which proposals demonstrated an understanding of the tradeoffs between cloud and labor costs.  Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp.  Page 11    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Protest at  22-23; Supp. Comments at  13-14.  The agency responds that its evaluation in \nthis regard was consistent with the RFP\u2019s terms, which contemplated an evaluation of \nan offeror\u2019s understanding of those tradeoffs.  COS\/MOL at  32-34; Supp. MOL at  18-20. \n We conclude that the agency did not depart from the terms of the RFP in assigning this weakness.  Under element B2, offerors were to provide a description of the innovative techniques they would use in service of the agency\u2019s \u201cultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.\u201d   RFP at 149.   Thus, the \nRFP notified offerors of the ends to which the agency sought application of offerors\u2019 proposed means.  In that way, the RFP expressly identified the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs as a matter the agency would consider with respect to element \nB2.  The agency therefore did not use an unstated evaluation criterion in assigning this \nweakness.  \n The protester further contends that its  proposal nevertheless did discuss balancing of \ncloud spend and labor costs.  Protest at  13-17; Comments & Supp. Protest at  23-27; \nSupp. Comments at  15-17.  The agency responds that it reasonably assigned this \nweakness based upon the content of the protester\u2019s proposal.  COS\/MOL  at 38-39; \nSupp. MOL at  20-22.  We conclude that the protester has not demonstrated that the \nassignment of this weakness was unreasonable.  \n As the agency recognized in its evaluation, the protester\u2019s proposal does discuss reducing both cloud spend and labor costs.  For example, the proposal opens its discussion of element B2 with a broad statement that the protester\u2019s \u201cproposed strategy provides [DELETED]  to meet [the agency\u2019s] mission objectives of maximizing the use of \ncloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, serverless) and optimizing workloads to \nreduce cloud spend and operational labor costs[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17.  \nThere are additional, scattered statements that also make reference to cloud spend and labor costs, such as a statement that the protester\u2019s proposed [DELETED]  \u201cwill \n[DELETED] , thereby maximizing the use of cloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, \nserverless) and advanced cloud optimizations, resulting in cloud spend cost savings[,]\u201d while also \u201c [DELETED] , resulting in reduced labor costs to deliver these services over \ntime as the capabilities evolve and mature.\u201d  Id. at 18. \n The concern expressed by the agency, however, is that the protester\u2019s proposal did not tie these disparate statements  together in such a way that demonstrated an \nunderstanding of the agency\u2019s goal of how those costs would be balanced to control long- term expenditures.  To that end, the SEB noted that \u201c[m]oving to cloud- native and \ncontainerized is not always the cheapest long- term solution.\u201d  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report \nat 92.  The disparate references in the protester\u2019s proposal to reductions in cloud spend \nand l abor costs, without a clear discussion of the relationship between them, do not  \ndemonstrate that the agency\u2019s concern in this regard was unreasonable.  \n By contrast, Modus21\u2019s proposal --which received neither a strength nor a weakness \nwith respect to its discussion of the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs --expressly \nrecognized the agency\u2019s concern that \u201c[h]istorically, system cloud migrations have  Page 12    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   forced the increase of [agency] sustainment labor [,]\u201d and discussed past successful \nimplementation of solutions \u201cto realize benefits of cloud -computing and minimize \nlong- tail costs of system sustainment, historically driven by labor.\u201d  AR, Tab 13, \nModus21 Proposal at  18.  The proposal then discussed several techniques that \nModus21 proposed to apply in service of cost -effectiveness optimization with respect to \nboth workloads transitioning to commercial cloud environments and agency systems \nalready running in a commercial cloud.  Id.  at 18-19.  Although the protester has not \nalleged any unequal treatment  in the evaluation of proposals , Modus21\u2019s proposal \nprovides a useful counterexample to demonstrate the nature of the concern that led the agency to assign a  weakness to the protester\u2019s proposal  under element B2.  As the \nprotester has not shown that the agency unreasonably assigned the weakness, we deny this ground of protest.  \n \nFailure to Assign Strengths to the Protester\u2019s Proposal  \n \nThe protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to assign five strengths to its proposal under the technical understanding factor.  Protest at  17-24; Comments & \nSupp. Protest at  27-30; Supp. Comments at  18-21.  Specifically, the protester contends \nthat the agency should have assigned strengths for the protester\u2019s proposed [DELETED] ; [DELETED] ; [DELETED]  solution  that leverages [DELETED]  for continuous \nmonitoring and optim ization; migration approach addressing both modern and legacy \nsystems; a nd framework for achieving continuous authority to operate (cATO).  In \nresponse, the agency has provided a sworn declaration by the SEB chair detailing the reasons that the SEB did not conclude that those aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal merited strengt hs.  See  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5-6. \n In reviewing a protest challenging a technical evaluation as unreasonable, we recognize that the contemporaneous evaluation record may lack documentation of evaluation judgments regarding individual aspects of a proposal that did not constitute strengths, and that a protester may later challenge as having been improperly disregarded.  To that end, we have noted that an agency is not required to document \u201cdeterminations of adequacy\u201d or explain in the evaluation record why it did not assess a strength, weakness, or deficiency for a particular item.  McLaughlin Research  Corp. , B-421528 et \nal, June 16, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 146 at  4.  An agency\u2019s judgment that the features \nidentified in a proposal did not significantly exceed the requirements of the RFP, and thus did not warrant the assessment of unique strengths, is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion and one that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate \nthat the evaluation was unreasonable.  Resource Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , B-421320, \nMar. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 101 at  9-10. \n With respect to the first three aspects that the protester argues were strengths of its proposal, the SEB chair points to the fact that they all are tied to the protester\u2019s proposed [DELETED] .  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  Thus, with respect to the first \nalleged missed strength, the protester\u2019s proposal states that \u201c[t]he [DELETED]  solution \nwill integrate into the [DELETED] \u2019s [DELETED]  capabilities[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 4, NexGen \nProposal at  17; see also Protest at  18 (quoting same).  The second alleged missed  Page 13    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   strength is the [DELETED]  itself.  See  Protest at  19-20.  And the third, regarding \nleveraging artificial intelligence \/machine learning for continuous monitoring and \noptimization, relates to the protester\u2019s proposed \u201c [DELETED]  [that] would progress \nthrough the [DELETED] [.]\u201d  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  18; see also Protest at  20 \n(quoting same).  The \u201c [DELETED] ,\u201d as the SEB chair points out, is part of the proposed \n[DELETED] .  See AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17 (proposing to \u201cincorporate \n[DELETED]  . . . into the .  . . [DELETED]  to implement [DELETED] \u201d). \n \nThe SEB chair states that these aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal did not merit the assignment of strengths because the proposed [DELETED]  included the use of \n[DELETED] , a tool that is not approved for use with the AWS GovCloud environment in \nwhich the agency must operate.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He points \nspecifically to the statement within the description of the [DELETED]  that the protester \n\u201cwill integrate  [DELETED]  (e.g. [DELETED] , [DELETED] , [DELETED] , with suitable \ngovernance and guardrails in accordance with [Department of Defense ( DOD )] \nguidelines and industry best practices for [DELETED] .\u201d  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal \nat 17.  The agency therefore did not consider these aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal \nto be strengths, as they relied upon a tool that is not available for the agency\u2019s use.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl.  at 5. \n The protester responds that it was unreasonable for the agency to consider the proposed [DELETED]  as being reliant upon [DELETED] , arguing that its proposal \n\u201cmerely listed [DELETED]  as one of several examples of innovative [DELETED]  tools \nthat could be integrated into its [DELETED]  solution over time.\u201d  Comments & Supp. \nProtest at  28.  The protester does not dispute, however, that [DELETED]  is not an \napproved tool.  While the protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s reading of its proposal, \nit has not shown that the agency\u2019s concern was unreasonable.  The RFP stated that the agency would \u201cassess the offeror\u2019s technical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their descriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements[,]\u201d and that it would \u201cevaluate the extent to which the offerors\u2019 .  . . proposal submission demonstrates \nunderstanding[.]\u201d  RFP at  149.  It is not unreasonable for the agency to be concerned \nthat proffering an unapproved tool for potential use does not sufficiently demonstrate an \nofferor\u2019s understanding of technical requirements  so as to warrant the assignment of \nmultiple strengths .  Cf.  Parsons Gov\u2019t Servs. Inc. , B-422849, Nov.  21, 2024, 2024 CPD \n\u00b6 287 at  13-15 (weakness reasonably assigned where protester proposed use of a tool \nthat was not accredited on DOD networks).   On this record, the protester has not \ndemonstrated that the agency\u2019s decision not to assign strengths for these three aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal was unreasonable, and we therefore deny these protest allegations.  \n Next, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its proposed migration approach addressing both modern and legacy systems, pointing in part to its proposal to \u201crapidly transition [scalable processor architecture (SPARC)]  systems to AWS \nOutposts.\u201d  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Protest at  21 (discussing \ntransition).  The SEB chair states that the agency did not assign a strength for this  Page 14    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   aspect because SPARC workloads cannot be transitioned to AWS Outposts due to a \nprocessor architecture mismatch.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He elaborates \nthat \u201c[t]he purpose of the Outposts is to rapidly transition x86 architecture based \nsystems while the SPARC workloads remain on- premises until they can be properly \nrefactored into x86- based systems.\u201d  Id. at 5-6.  The protester does not dispute these \nstatements , see generally  Supp. Comments , and we discern no discussion in the \nprotester\u2019s proposal recognizing the need for refactoring of SPARC workloads identified \nby the SEB chair .  Again, the protester has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s position \nwas unreasonable, as the proposal does not adequately explain the protester\u2019s \ntechnical understanding regarding the transition of SPARC systems  or why its approach \nwould otherwise warrant the assignment of a strength.  We accordingly deny this protest \nallegation as well.  \n Finally, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its comprehensive framework for achieving cATO.  See  Protest at  22-23.  The SEB chair states that the \nprotester\u2019s proposed solution \u201cdoes nothing for the Government\u2019s existing infrastructure -based common control provider  packages that are the largest part of our \ncurrent RMF ATO workload.\u201d  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  6.  The protester \nresponds that this position ignores discussion in its proposal that, under its proposed framework, \u201c[DELETED] .\u201d  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Comments & \nSupp. Protest at  30 (quoting same).  The agency does not substantively address the \nprotester\u2019s rebuttal, stating only that the agency did not overlook this statement in the protester\u2019s proposal, and reiterating the SEB chair\u2019 s statement.  See Supp. MOL at  30. \n In the absence of a clear explanation from the agency addressing the substance of the \nproposal language to which the protester points, we are unable to draw any conclusion \nwhether the protester has demonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable in this regard.   Even if the agency\u2019s failure to assign a strength for this aspect of the \nprotester\u2019s proposal was unreasonable, however, we conclude that the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable possibility of  prejudice arising from that lone putati ve error.   \nCompetitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency\u2019s improper actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  ICI Servs. Corp. , B-418255.5, B -418255.6, Oct.  13, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 342 at  13.  Where the \nrecord establishes no reasonable possibility of prejudice, we will not sustain a protest even if defects in the procurement were found.  Id.  \n As discussed above, the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable in all other regards.  Thus, the agency\u2019s conclusions that the protester\u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor and that Modus21\u2019 s proposal was \u201ctechnically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s proposal under the \nstaffing plan factor remain undisturbed.  Under the technical understanding factor, the agency assigned two strengths and one weakness to Modus21\u2019s proposal, and no strengths and one weakness to the protester\u2019s proposal, concluding that Modus21\u2019s proposal --which merited strengths under both elements of the factor --\u201cprovides more  Page 15    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   benefit across more aspects\u201d of the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD \nat 15. \n \nEven assuming that the protester\u2019s proposal received a strength under element B1 for \nits comprehensive framework for achieving cATO , as the protester urges, the protester\u2019s \nproposal still would not offer strengths across both elements of the technical understanding factor, as the agency found supported its finding that Modus21\u2019s \nproposal  was technically superior  under that factor .  Furthermore, even if the technical \ngap between the two proposals were to narrow, such that the agency would have found that Modus21\u2019s proposal was only \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s  \nproposal under the technical understanding factor , at most that would leave the \nproposals with offsetting advantages under the technical capability and technical \nunderstanding factors, which were equally important under the RFP\u2019s terms.   \nModus21\u2019s proposal therefore would have remained the technically superior offer, due to its unchallenged advantage under the staffing plan factor.   As the RFP provided that \nthe agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal was technically superior with a fair and reasonable cost\/price, the protester cannot demonstrate that it would have had a substantial chance of award, even if its proposal had received this \nallegedly overlooked strength.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

The protester contends that the agency \nimproperly evaluated proposals and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  \nresulting from that improper evaluation.  We deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   BACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the RFP on September  17, 2024, pursuant to the procedures in \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart  16.5, to firms holding the Navy\u2019s \nSeaPort -Next Generation indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement  and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at  3.  The RFP, \nwhich the agency amended twice, was set aside for small businesses and sought proposals for the provision of IT, network, planning, architectural analysis, evaluation, design, development, engineering, transition, cyber security, programmatic, and sustainment support services.  Id.  at 3-4; Agency Report (AR) Tab 3, RFP at  8.  A \nprimary focus of the services to be provided is the transition from a mostly Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) hosting methodology --which meets business process needs through \non-premises data center hosting- -to commercial cloud hosting environments including \nIaaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.  RFP at 9. \n The RFP contemplated issuance of a single, cost -plus-fixed -fee, level -of-effort task \norder with a 12- month base period and four , 12-month options.  Id.  at 2, 101.  The total \nlevel of effort across all 60 months of performance is 1,787,550 labor hours.  Id. at 4; \nCOS\/MOL at 3.  The agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal \nwas determined to be the technically superior proposal with a fair and reasonable cost\/price.  RFP at  147.  The agency would determine technical superiority on the basis \nof three factors:  technical capability ; technical understanding;  and staffing plan.  Id. \nat 147-149.  Only the technical capability and technical understanding factors are \nrelevant here.  \n Under the technical capability factor, offerors were to submit information regarding at least one, and no more than five, examples of corporate experience.  Id. at 141.  The \nRFP required offerors to submit at least one reference performed by the offeror and at least one reference performed by any significant subcontractor, a term the RFP defined as a subcontractor or any subsidiary or separate legal entity affiliated with the offeror that was proposed to perform at least 20 percent (without rounding) of the total \nproposed labor hours.  Id.   The RFP stated that the agency would evaluate only \nreferences performed by either the offeror or a significant subcontractor, and that any other reference data would not be considered.  Id.   The RFP  further  stated that \u201c[o]nly \ncontract references that are determined to be current and relevant will be evaluated.\u201d  Id. at 149.  The RFP defined \u201ccurrent\u201d as having been performed within the last three \nyears from the date of RFP issuance, and \u201crelevant\u201d as being \u201csimilar to the requirements of [the] RFP.\u201d  Id. at 141. \n The RFP provided that the agency would evaluate proposals under the technical capability factor considering three elements, referred to as elements A1, A2, and A3:  \n \nElement A1:  Demonstrate experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud at Impact Level 4.  Taking into consideration AWS best practices and cloud  service manager requirements, demonstrate  Page 3    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, \nadministration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with [Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)] Provisional Authorizations (PA).  Experience supporting a cloud broker in the \ndevelopment and delivery of self -service capabilities in support of hosted \nsystems is considered more valuable to the Government.  \n Element A2:   Demonstrate experience providing sustainment services \nconsisting of Network, Compute, Storage, Virtualization, Operating Systems, Domain Services, Remote Access, Backup, and off -site Disaster \nRecovery, for at least one on- premises enterprise datacenter.  Describe \nthe manning that was required and the environment size in terms of scope of responsibility for the full stack and the virtual server count.  Experience sustaining a hybrid on -premises\/commercial cloud environment is \nconsidered more val uable to the Government.  \n Element A3:  Demonstrate experience accomplishing business process re-engineering through modernizing either a client -server, or an n- tier, \nsoftware -based system to take advantage of commercial cloud offerings of \nnative services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.  Experience using code deployment pipelines as part of the software development lifecycle is considered more valuable to the Government.  \n \nId. at 148. \n \nWith respect to the technical understanding factor, the RFP directed offerors to \n\u201cdemonstrate[] their technical understanding of the [performance work statement] \nrequirements by providing a detailed description of the processes and procedures proposed to accomplish the tasks, while minimizing performance risk[.]\u201d  Id. at 142.  In \nparticular, offerors were to describe, and the agency would evaluate,  their approaches \nto two elements, referred to as elements B1 and B2:  \n \nElement B1:  Ensuring compliance with Naval Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidelines and including the special needs of containerized workloads, describe your approach for implementing automation into an existing manual continuous monitoring and artifact generation process to enable the reduction in personnel required to support Common Control Provider[\n1] (not hosted system level) RMF \nAuthorizations to Operate (ATO), and to maintain operational Cyber Security compliance, for both on- premises data centers and commercial \ncloud brokerages.  \n \n \n1 The RFP defined \u201cCommon Control Provider\u201d as \u201can organization official responsible \nfor the development, implementation, assessment and monitoring of common controls (i.e., security controls inherited by hosted information systems).\u201d  RFP at  142.  Page 4    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Element B2:  Describe the innovative techniques you would use to \nperform cost- effectiveness optimization of Navy on- premises workloads \nmoving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems already running in a commercial cloud, taking into account modernization opportuniti es, system \navailability, [and] security, with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.  \n \nId. at 149. \n The RFP provided that the agency would assess technical understanding based upon offerors \u2019 \u201ctechnical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their \ndescriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements.\u201d  Id.  It advised that proposals \u201cthat \ndemonstrate understanding by increasing efficiencies, and\/or minimiz e performance risk \nare more valuable to the agency.\u201d  Id.  It further stated that the agency would evaluate \nthe extent to which proposals \u201cdemonstrate[] understanding and clearly, completely, and accurately describe[] the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully resolve the .  . . tasks described in the elements.\u201d  Id. \n The agency received 14 timely proposals in response to the RFP, including from the \nprotester and Modus21.  COS\/MOL at  4.  Following a compliance review, the agency \nrejected two proposals prior to evaluation.  Id.   One of those rejections was the subject \nof a previous protest filed with our Office, which we dismissed as academic  after the \nagency stated that it would consider and evaluate the proposal.  See  OSC Edge , \nB-423209, Dec.  12, 2024 (unpublished decision).  \n As discussed further below, the agency assigned various strengths and weaknesses to the proposals, resulting in the following adjectival ratings for the proposals submitted by  \nthe protester and Modus21:  \n \n NexGen  Modus21  \nTECHNICAL CAPABILITY  Outstanding  Outstanding  \nTECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING  Acceptabl e Good  \nSTAFFING PLAN  Outstanding  Outstanding  \n AR, Tab  5, Selection Evaluation Board (SEB) Report at  6; Tab 6, Source Selection \nDecision Document (SSDD) at  5. \n In comparing the two proposals, the agency concluded that the protester\u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor, but that Modus21\u2019s proposal was \u201ctechnically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s proposal under the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  The \nagency further concluded that Modus21\u2019s proposal was \u201ctechnically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s proposal under the staffing plan factor.  Id. at 16.  On the basis of that \ncomparison, the agency determined Modus21\u2019s proposal to be \u201cslightly technically \nsuperior \u201d to NexGen\u2019s proposal.  Id.  at 19.  The agency further concluded that  Page 5    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21\u2019s total evaluated cost of $215,280,363 was reasonable and realistic, and \ntherefore that the agency would issue the task order to Modus21 under the RFP\u2019s \ntechnically superior, fair and reasonable cost\/price evaluation method.  Id.  at 20.  This \nprotest followed.2 \n DISCUSSION  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor, unreasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s proposal under the technical understanding factor, and conducted a flawed comparison of proposals  based upon an improper evaluation.\n3  We have reviewed the protester\u2019s \narguments and conclude that none provides us with a basis to sustain the protest .4 \n \nWhere an agency conducts a competition among contractors for the issuance of a task \nor delivery order under part  16 of the FAR, our Office will review the competition to \nensure that it was conducted in accordance with the solicitation and applicable procur ement laws and regulations.

In reviewing protests of awards in a task order competition, we \ndo not reevaluate proposals but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source  selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the \nsolicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  Id.  \n \nTechnical Capability Factor  \n \nThe protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated Modus21\u2019s references \nunder the technical capability factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-19; Supp. \nComments at  3-10.  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated Modus21\u2019s \nproposal in accordance with the RFP\u2019s terms.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL)  \nat 5-14.  As discussed below, we discern no basis to sustain the protest with respect to \nthe evaluation of Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor.  \n \n \n2 As the value of the issued task order exceeds $35 million, this protest is within our \njurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ \ncontracts that were awarded under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7  3406(f)(1)(B ). \n3 The protester initially challenged the agency\u2019s evaluation of Modus21\u2019s proposal under \nthe staffing plan factor, see Protest at  31-34, but withdrew that allegation, see \nComments & Supp. Protest at  31. \n4 The protester also raises various collateral arguments.  Although we do not address \nevery argument, we have reviewed them all and find no basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Modus21\u2019s proposal included four references under the technical capability factor, one \nperformed by Modus21 and three by its subcontractor, [SUBCONTRACTOR] .5  AR, \nTab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  3, 6.  The agency \u2019s evaluation contains a detailed \ndiscussion of the experience demonstrated by each reference, as well as a determination that each of those references was both current and relevant.  AR, Tab 5, \nSEB Report at  72-75.  In evaluating Modus21\u2019s proposal, the agency assigned a \nsignificant strength under element A3, as well as three strengths, one under each element of the factor.  Id.  at 75-76; AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6-8.  The agency also assigned \ntwo weaknesses to Modus21\u2019s proposal, one under each of element s A1 and A2.  AR, \nTab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6-7. \n On the basis of the evaluation, the agency concluded that NexGen\u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to Modus21\u2019s under the technical capability factor.  AR, \nTab 6, SSDD at  14.  While the protester\u2019s proposal --like Modus21\u2019s proposal --had \nreceived one significant strength and three strengths, it had not received any \nweaknesses.  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  88-89; Tab 6, SSDD at  13-14.  The agency did, \nhowever, assign two weaknesses to Modus21\u2019s proposal and concluded these \nweaknesses introduced \u201cnom inal risk,\u201d thereby narrowing the technical advantages of \nthe protester\u2019s proposal.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  14. \n \nThe protester contends that the agency improperly assigned a significant strength to \nModus21\u2019s proposal.  The record reflects that the agency assigned a significant strength \nwith respect to element A3, which asked offerors to \u201c[d]emonstrate experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through modernizing either a \nclient -server, or an n- tier, software -based system to take advantage of commercial \ncloud offerings of native services, SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS.\u201d  A R, Tab 5, SEB Report at  76; \nTab 6, SSDD at  8; RFP at  148.  This significant strength was based upon two of \nModus21\u2019s references:  one performed by Modus21 and one by [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  \nAR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76.  Specifically, the agency noted that Modus21\u2019s proposal \n\u201cdemonstrate[d] experience accomplishing business process re- engineering through the \nuse of cloud native services across all of IaaS, PaaS[,] and SaaS[,]\u201d whereas the \n \n5 The protester contends that the agency improperly considered [SUBCONTRACTOR] \u2019s \nreferences, arguing that Modus21 did not propose [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to perform at \nleast 20 percent of the total proposed labor hours as the RFP required to qualify as a \nsignificant subcontractor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  3-4; Supp. Comments at  2-3.  \nThe protester\u2019s argument , however,  relies on extrapolation from Modus21\u2019s staffing \nplan--in which offerors were to list individuals proposed for ten positions accounting for \nonly 19,200 of the first year of performance\u2019s 357,510 labor hours , see RFP at  143, \n226-227--as well as rounding, in contravention of the RFP\u2019s directive that whether a \nsubcontractor was \u201csignificant\u201d was to be determined without rounding.  Moreover, as reflected in Modus21\u2019s cost\/price proposal, Modus21 proposed [SUBCONTRACTOR]  to \nperform [DELETED] --over 20 percent --of the total proposed 1,787,550 labor hours.  AR, \nTab 14, Modus21 Pricing Model at  3.  The record therefore refutes the protester\u2019s \ncontention that [SUBCONTRACTOR]  does not qualify as a significant subcontractor \nwhose corporate experience was to be considered under the RFP\u2019s terms.   Page 7    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   element asked offerors to demonstrate the use of only one of those solutions.  Id.   The \nagency concluded that the demonstration of experience across all of the available \nservice areas would aid in modernization efforts, and that knowledge of PaaS and SaaS solutions was relevant to the provision of services that could greatly reduce labor overhead for maintenance.  Id.  \n The protester raises two separate challenges to the assignment of this significant \nstrength.  First, the protester contends that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign it based upon the reference performed by Modus21, as that  reference reflected only \nfour months of performance as a subcontractor on a contract valued at approximately $10 million.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  5-8.  Second, the protester argues that \nModus21\u2019s proposal does not reflect that the reference performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR]  demonstrated business process re- engineering through the use \nof a SaaS solution.  Id.  at 14-16. \n With respect to the protester\u2019s first argument, the record of the agency\u2019s evaluation is clear that this significant strength was not based solely on the reference performed by Modus21; rather, it was based upon both references.  See  AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76 \n(citing both references\n6).  Thus, to whatever extent the reference performed by \nModus21 does not, on its own, support the assignment of a significant strength, the record refutes the foundational premise of the protester\u2019s argument , i.e., that it was \nunreasonable to assign a significant strength based only upon four months of \nperformance as a subcontractor on a comparatively lower -valued effort .  The protester \ndoes not dispute that the reference demonstrated experience across all three of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Where the element asked offerors to demonstrate experience with \nonly one of those categories of solutions, it was not unreasonable for t he agency to find \nthat this experience, when combined with further experience across those solutions, \nhad appreciable merit or exceeded requirements to the considerable advantage of the \ngovernment.  \n The record, as clarified by the agency, also refutes the protester\u2019s second argument.  \nThe protester contends that Modus21\u2019s proposal states that the reference performed by \n[SUBCONTRACTOR]  involved only PaaS and IaaS, not SaaS .  See  Comments & Supp. \nProtest at  15 (quoting statement in Modus21\u2019s proposal that \u201cTeaM21 implemented \n[DELETED]  on the [DELETED]  commercial cloud brokerage, thereby enabling \n[DELETED]  to utilize cloud -native services, PaaS, and IaaS from [DELETED] , \n[DELETED] , and [DELETED] \u201d).\n7  Thus, the protester contends, it was unreasonable for \n \n6 The SEB report mistakenly refers to the reference performed by \n[SUBCONTRACTOR] --which is the fourth and final reference submitted by Modus21--\nas \u201cCR [(contract reference)] 5,\u201d but the accompanying page number reference to Modus21\u2019s proposal makes clear that the agency was considering contract reference 4.  \nSee AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  76. \n7 The protester also alleges that, by referring to \u201cTeaM21\u201d in describing work performed \nin its technical capability references, Modus21\u2019s proposal contains material \n(continued...)   Page 8    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   the agency to find that  this reference also  demonstrated  experience with all three of \nIaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  \n \nAs described in Modus21\u2019s proposal, this reference involves [SUBCONTRACTOR] \u2019s \nsupport of [DELETED] , \u201can enterprise- level digital transformation\u201d that applies \u201ccloud \ncomputing, [PaaS], [IaaS], .  . . and SaaS in support of cloud- native application \narchitectures.\u201d  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 Proposal at  14.  The proposal further discusses \n[SUBCONTRACTOR] \u2019s integration of [DELETED]  and [DELETED]  into [DELETED] \u2019s \ncode development pipeline.  Id.   As explained by the agency, [DELETED]  \u201cis recognized \nto be a SaaS solution.\u201d  Supp. MOL at  14.  The protester does not rebut  this \ncharacterization.  See generally  Supp. Comments.   Thus, it was not unreasonable for \nthe agency to conclude that this reference involved IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  Nor was it unreasonable for the agency to conclude that this reference, when combined with the reference performed by Modus21, demonstrated a breadth of experience meriting the \nassignment of a significant strength.  This allegation therefore provides no basis to sustain the protest.  \n The protester also challenges the agency\u2019s conclusion that the weaknesses assigned to Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor presented nominal risk.  In that regard, the agency assigned a weakness under element A1, which sought experience performing software updates, performance tuning, patching, administration, backups, monitoring, and maintenance while utilizing services with DISA PA s.  AR, Tab  5, SEB \n \nmisrepresentations suggesting that Modus21 and its subcontractors performed references that were, in fact, performed by either Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  \nalone.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  6-7, 10, 13- 14, 15- 16; Supp. Comments at  5-6, 7, \n8-9, 10.  The protester argues that these misrepresentations render the assignment of \nstrengths improper and should have resulted in the disqualification of Modus21 from the \ncompetition.  Id. \nModus21\u2019s proposal, however, clearly identifies its technical capability references as being performed by Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR] .  See  AR, Tab 13, Modus21 \nProposal at  3 (identifying Modus21 as the performing contractor), 6 (identifying \n[SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor).  Additionally, the agency\u2019s \nevaluation identifies Modus21 and [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractors.  \nSee AR, Tab  5, SEB Report at  72 (stating that \u201cModus21 and its significant \nsubcontractor ( [SUBCONTRACTOR] ) submitted a total of four (4) contract references\u201d \nand identifying Modus21 or [SUBCONTRACTOR]  as the performing contractor for each \nreference).  Thus, the proposal does not contain misrepresentations, and the record demonstrates that, to whatever extent the proposal\u2019s references to \u201cTeaM21\u201d might rise to the level of misrepresentations, the agency \u2019s evaluation did not rel y on those alleged \nmisrepresentations.  We therefore deny this allegation.  See, e.g. , Avar Consulting, Inc. , \nB-417668.3 et al. , June 10, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 191 at  9-10 (denying allegation of \nmaterial misrepresentation regarding experience and past performance where the statements did not amount to misrepresentations and the agency did not rely upon them).   Page 9    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6; RFP at  148.  The agency concluded that Modus21\u2019s \nsecond technical capability reference--performed by [SUBCONTRACTOR] --did not \ndemonstrate experience performing common maintenance tasks within AWS GovCloud \nor performance tuning utilizing services with DISA PAs and assigned a weakness on that basis.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  77; Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The agency further \nconcluded, however, that the risks associated with this weakness were nominal, as the proposal discussed experience with monitoring services that support performance tuning services, as well as having realized benefits of performance tuning such as reducing hosting, development, and migration costs.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  6.  The \nagency also found that the proposal demonstrated experience with common AWS administration items and a knowledge of AWS services with DISA PAs, thereby reducing the risks associated with the lack of experience with maintenance.  Id.  \n The protester argues that, because the RFP sought experience with maintenance and performance tuning, it did not permit the agency to make a determination beyond its conclusion that Modus21\u2019s proposal failed to demonstrate experience with those tasks.\n8  \nComments & Supp. Protest at  9-10; Supp. Comments at  6-7.  In other words, the \nprotester contends that the agency was permitted only to make a binary evaluation decision based upon whether the proposal did or did not demonstrate the requested experience.  We disagree.  \n The RFP did request a demonstration of experience with certain tasks under element A2, and the record reflects that the agency assigned a weakness for failure to demonstrate some of that experience.  The analysis regarding the risk associated with \nthat weakness, however, reflects a qualitative assessment of the magnitude of that risk.  \nIn that regard, the agency concluded that, while Modus21\u2019s proposal failed to \ndemonstrate some of  the requested experience, it did demonstrate experience with \nother, related tasks that lessened the risk associated with lack of demonstrated experience with maintenance and performance tuning.  The protester expresses only disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment regarding the degree to which the risks introduced by lack of experi ence were mitigated by other experience demonstrated in \nthe proposal.  Without more, the protester\u2019s argument does not show that the agency\u2019s \n \n8 The protester also contends that, because the agency found that Modus21\u2019s proposal \nfailed to demonstrate experience with two tasks listed under element A2, it was unreasonable for the agency to assign only one weakness, rather than two.  Comments & Supp. Protest at  9; Supp. Comments at  7.  As we consistently have stated, the \nassignment of adjectival ratings and the source selection generally should not be based \nupon a simple count of strengths and weaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals.  Spatial Front, Inc. , B-417985, B -417985.2, Dec.  18, 2019, 2020 CPD \u00b6 8 \nat 4 (citing National Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. , B-412142, Dec.  30, 2015, 2016 CPD \u00b6 8 at 15; \nEpsilon Sys. Sols., Inc. , B-409720, B -409720.2, July  21, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 230 at  8).  \nHere, the record reflects that the agency identified and qualitatively considered the demonstrated lack of experience with both the maintenance and performance tuning tasks.  Accordingly, whether that lack of experience was labeled a single or multiple weaknesses is immaterial.   Page 10    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   evaluation was unreasonable.  See  Sparksoft Corp. , B-420944.4, June 2, 2023, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 155 at  11-12 (evaluation was reasonable where the agency concluded that \na weakness for lack of experience was mitigated by demonstration of related \nexperience).   We therefore deny this protest allegation.  \n For similar reasons, we deny the protester\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that the weakness assigned to Modus21\u2019s proposal under element A3 presented nominal risk.  See  Comments & Supp. Protest at  12-13; Supp. Comments at  8.  The \nrecord reflects that the agency found that the weakness --assigned for not demonstrating \nexperience with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center --was mitigated \nby demonstrated experi ence supporting two private cloud data centers and managing \nthe VMWare virtual enterprise, which the agency concluded \u201cwould have been on a compute environment.\u201d  AR, Tab 6, SSDD at  7.  While the agency found that the \nproposal lacked details as to the nature of the compute infrastructure supported, the experience related to the element\u2019s compute sustainment task and thereby reduced the risk associated with the lack of demonstrated experience specifically with sustaining compute within an on- premises data center.  Id.   We therefore deny this protest \nallegation as well.  \n Technical Understanding Factor  \n Next, the protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of its proposal under the technical understanding factor, alleging that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness and failed to assign multiple strengths.  We find no basis to sustain the \nprotest.  \n \nWeakness Assigned to the Protester\u2019s Proposal  \n \nThe agency assigned a weakness to the protester\u2019s proposal under the technical understanding factor with respect to element B2, which sought a description of \u201cthe innovative techniques [the offeror] would use to perform cost -effectiveness optimization \nof Navy on- premises workloads moving to commercial cloud and of Navy systems \nalready running in a commercial cloud, .  . . with the ultimate goal of balancing cloud \nspend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.\u201d  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report \nat 92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15; RFP at  149.  The agency found that while the protester\u2019s \nproposal discussed actions to optimize costs of cloud- operating systems, it did not \ndiscuss or demonstrate an understanding of balancing cloud costs and labor required to sustain the system over time.  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report at  92; Tab 6, SSDD at  14-15.  \nThe agency expressed concern that a lack of understanding of how to cost -optimize a \nsystem in a way that balances cloud costs and sustainment labor posed cost risks to the agency, and therefore assigned a weakness to the proposal.  Id.  \n The protester first alleges that the agency assigned this weakness on the basis of an unstated evaluation criterion, contending that the RFP did not advise offerors that the agency would consider the extent to which proposals demonstrated an understanding of the tradeoffs between cloud and labor costs.  Protest at  11-13; Comments & Supp.  Page 11    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   Protest at  22-23; Supp. Comments at  13-14.  The agency responds that its evaluation in \nthis regard was consistent with the RFP\u2019s terms, which contemplated an evaluation of \nan offeror\u2019s understanding of those tradeoffs.  COS\/MOL at  32-34; Supp. MOL at  18-20. \n We conclude that the agency did not depart from the terms of the RFP in assigning this weakness.  Under element B2, offerors were to provide a description of the innovative techniques they would use in service of the agency\u2019s \u201cultimate goal of balancing cloud spend and the labor required to sustain the system over time.\u201d   RFP at 149.   Thus, the \nRFP notified offerors of the ends to which the agency sought application of offerors\u2019 proposed means.  In that way, the RFP expressly identified the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs as a matter the agency would consider with respect to element \nB2.  The agency therefore did not use an unstated evaluation criterion in assigning this \nweakness.  \n The protester further contends that its  proposal nevertheless did discuss balancing of \ncloud spend and labor costs.  Protest at  13-17; Comments & Supp. Protest at  23-27; \nSupp. Comments at  15-17.  The agency responds that it reasonably assigned this \nweakness based upon the content of the protester\u2019s proposal.  COS\/MOL  at 38-39; \nSupp. MOL at  20-22.  We conclude that the protester has not demonstrated that the \nassignment of this weakness was unreasonable.  \n As the agency recognized in its evaluation, the protester\u2019s proposal does discuss reducing both cloud spend and labor costs.  For example, the proposal opens its discussion of element B2 with a broad statement that the protester\u2019s \u201cproposed strategy provides [DELETED]  to meet [the agency\u2019s] mission objectives of maximizing the use of \ncloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, serverless) and optimizing workloads to \nreduce cloud spend and operational labor costs[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17.  \nThere are additional, scattered statements that also make reference to cloud spend and labor costs, such as a statement that the protester\u2019s proposed [DELETED]  \u201cwill \n[DELETED] , thereby maximizing the use of cloud- native architectures (i.e., containers, \nserverless) and advanced cloud optimizations, resulting in cloud spend cost savings[,]\u201d while also \u201c [DELETED] , resulting in reduced labor costs to deliver these services over \ntime as the capabilities evolve and mature.\u201d  Id. at 18. \n The concern expressed by the agency, however, is that the protester\u2019s proposal did not tie these disparate statements  together in such a way that demonstrated an \nunderstanding of the agency\u2019s goal of how those costs would be balanced to control long- term expenditures.  To that end, the SEB noted that \u201c[m]oving to cloud- native and \ncontainerized is not always the cheapest long- term solution.\u201d  AR, Tab 5, SEB Report \nat 92.  The disparate references in the protester\u2019s proposal to reductions in cloud spend \nand l abor costs, without a clear discussion of the relationship between them, do not  \ndemonstrate that the agency\u2019s concern in this regard was unreasonable.  \n By contrast, Modus21\u2019s proposal --which received neither a strength nor a weakness \nwith respect to its discussion of the balancing of cloud spend and labor costs --expressly \nrecognized the agency\u2019s concern that \u201c[h]istorically, system cloud migrations have  Page 12    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   forced the increase of [agency] sustainment labor [,]\u201d and discussed past successful \nimplementation of solutions \u201cto realize benefits of cloud -computing and minimize \nlong- tail costs of system sustainment, historically driven by labor.\u201d  AR, Tab 13, \nModus21 Proposal at  18.  The proposal then discussed several techniques that \nModus21 proposed to apply in service of cost -effectiveness optimization with respect to \nboth workloads transitioning to commercial cloud environments and agency systems \nalready running in a commercial cloud.  Id.  at 18-19.  Although the protester has not \nalleged any unequal treatment  in the evaluation of proposals , Modus21\u2019s proposal \nprovides a useful counterexample to demonstrate the nature of the concern that led the agency to assign a  weakness to the protester\u2019s proposal  under element B2.  As the \nprotester has not shown that the agency unreasonably assigned the weakness, we deny this ground of protest.  \n \nFailure to Assign Strengths to the Protester\u2019s Proposal  \n \nThe protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to assign five strengths to its proposal under the technical understanding factor.  Protest at  17-24; Comments & \nSupp. Protest at  27-30; Supp. Comments at  18-21.  Specifically, the protester contends \nthat the agency should have assigned strengths for the protester\u2019s proposed [DELETED] ; [DELETED] ; [DELETED]  solution  that leverages [DELETED]  for continuous \nmonitoring and optim ization; migration approach addressing both modern and legacy \nsystems; a nd framework for achieving continuous authority to operate (cATO).  In \nresponse, the agency has provided a sworn declaration by the SEB chair detailing the reasons that the SEB did not conclude that those aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal merited strengt hs.  See  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5-6. \n In reviewing a protest challenging a technical evaluation as unreasonable, we recognize that the contemporaneous evaluation record may lack documentation of evaluation judgments regarding individual aspects of a proposal that did not constitute strengths, and that a protester may later challenge as having been improperly disregarded.  To that end, we have noted that an agency is not required to document \u201cdeterminations of adequacy\u201d or explain in the evaluation record why it did not assess a strength, weakness, or deficiency for a particular item.  McLaughlin Research  Corp. , B-421528 et \nal, June 16, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 146 at  4.  An agency\u2019s judgment that the features \nidentified in a proposal did not significantly exceed the requirements of the RFP, and thus did not warrant the assessment of unique strengths, is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion and one that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate \nthat the evaluation was unreasonable.  Resource Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , B-421320, \nMar. 20, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 101 at  9-10. \n With respect to the first three aspects that the protester argues were strengths of its proposal, the SEB chair points to the fact that they all are tied to the protester\u2019s proposed [DELETED] .  AR, Tab  11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  Thus, with respect to the first \nalleged missed strength, the protester\u2019s proposal states that \u201c[t]he [DELETED]  solution \nwill integrate into the [DELETED] \u2019s [DELETED]  capabilities[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 4, NexGen \nProposal at  17; see also Protest at  18 (quoting same).  The second alleged missed  Page 13    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   strength is the [DELETED]  itself.  See  Protest at  19-20.  And the third, regarding \nleveraging artificial intelligence \/machine learning for continuous monitoring and \noptimization, relates to the protester\u2019s proposed \u201c [DELETED]  [that] would progress \nthrough the [DELETED] [.]\u201d  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  18; see also Protest at  20 \n(quoting same).  The \u201c [DELETED] ,\u201d as the SEB chair points out, is part of the proposed \n[DELETED] .  See AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17 (proposing to \u201cincorporate \n[DELETED]  . . . into the .  . . [DELETED]  to implement [DELETED] \u201d). \n \nThe SEB chair states that these aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal did not merit the assignment of strengths because the proposed [DELETED]  included the use of \n[DELETED] , a tool that is not approved for use with the AWS GovCloud environment in \nwhich the agency must operate.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He points \nspecifically to the statement within the description of the [DELETED]  that the protester \n\u201cwill integrate  [DELETED]  (e.g. [DELETED] , [DELETED] , [DELETED] , with suitable \ngovernance and guardrails in accordance with [Department of Defense ( DOD )] \nguidelines and industry best practices for [DELETED] .\u201d  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal \nat 17.  The agency therefore did not consider these aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal \nto be strengths, as they relied upon a tool that is not available for the agency\u2019s use.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl.  at 5. \n The protester responds that it was unreasonable for the agency to consider the proposed [DELETED]  as being reliant upon [DELETED] , arguing that its proposal \n\u201cmerely listed [DELETED]  as one of several examples of innovative [DELETED]  tools \nthat could be integrated into its [DELETED]  solution over time.\u201d  Comments & Supp. \nProtest at  28.  The protester does not dispute, however, that [DELETED]  is not an \napproved tool.  While the protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s reading of its proposal, \nit has not shown that the agency\u2019s concern was unreasonable.  The RFP stated that the agency would \u201cassess the offeror\u2019s technical understanding of the requirements as demonstrated by their descriptions of the actions, methods, and processes proposed to successfully accomplish the tasks described in the elements[,]\u201d and that it would \u201cevaluate the extent to which the offerors\u2019 .  . . proposal submission demonstrates \nunderstanding[.]\u201d  RFP at  149.  It is not unreasonable for the agency to be concerned \nthat proffering an unapproved tool for potential use does not sufficiently demonstrate an \nofferor\u2019s understanding of technical requirements  so as to warrant the assignment of \nmultiple strengths .  Cf.  Parsons Gov\u2019t Servs. Inc. , B-422849, Nov.  21, 2024, 2024 CPD \n\u00b6 287 at  13-15 (weakness reasonably assigned where protester proposed use of a tool \nthat was not accredited on DOD networks).   On this record, the protester has not \ndemonstrated that the agency\u2019s decision not to assign strengths for these three aspects of the protester\u2019s proposal was unreasonable, and we therefore deny these protest allegations.  \n Next, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its proposed migration approach addressing both modern and legacy systems, pointing in part to its proposal to \u201crapidly transition [scalable processor architecture (SPARC)]  systems to AWS \nOutposts.\u201d  AR, Tab 4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Protest at  21 (discussing \ntransition).  The SEB chair states that the agency did not assign a strength for this  Page 14    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   aspect because SPARC workloads cannot be transitioned to AWS Outposts due to a \nprocessor architecture mismatch.  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  5.  He elaborates \nthat \u201c[t]he purpose of the Outposts is to rapidly transition x86 architecture based \nsystems while the SPARC workloads remain on- premises until they can be properly \nrefactored into x86- based systems.\u201d  Id. at 5-6.  The protester does not dispute these \nstatements , see generally  Supp. Comments , and we discern no discussion in the \nprotester\u2019s proposal recognizing the need for refactoring of SPARC workloads identified \nby the SEB chair .  Again, the protester has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s position \nwas unreasonable, as the proposal does not adequately explain the protester\u2019s \ntechnical understanding regarding the transition of SPARC systems  or why its approach \nwould otherwise warrant the assignment of a strength.  We accordingly deny this protest \nallegation as well.  \n Finally, the protester alleges that its proposal merited a strength for its comprehensive framework for achieving cATO.  See  Protest at  22-23.  The SEB chair states that the \nprotester\u2019s proposed solution \u201cdoes nothing for the Government\u2019s existing infrastructure -based common control provider  packages that are the largest part of our \ncurrent RMF ATO workload.\u201d  AR, Tab 11, SEB Chair Decl. at  6.  The protester \nresponds that this position ignores discussion in its proposal that, under its proposed framework, \u201c[DELETED] .\u201d  AR, Tab  4, NexGen Proposal at  17; see also Comments & \nSupp. Protest at  30 (quoting same).  The agency does not substantively address the \nprotester\u2019s rebuttal, stating only that the agency did not overlook this statement in the protester\u2019s proposal, and reiterating the SEB chair\u2019 s statement.  See Supp. MOL at  30. \n In the absence of a clear explanation from the agency addressing the substance of the \nproposal language to which the protester points, we are unable to draw any conclusion \nwhether the protester has demonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable in this regard.   Even if the agency\u2019s failure to assign a strength for this aspect of the \nprotester\u2019s proposal was unreasonable, however, we conclude that the protester cannot demonstrate a reasonable possibility of  prejudice arising from that lone putati ve error.   \nCompetitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency\u2019s improper actions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  ICI Servs. Corp. , B-418255.5, B -418255.6, Oct.  13, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 342 at  13.  Where the \nrecord establishes no reasonable possibility of prejudice, we will not sustain a protest even if defects in the procurement were found.  Id.  \n As discussed above, the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable in all other regards.  Thus, the agency\u2019s conclusions that the protester\u2019s proposal was \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to Modus21\u2019s proposal under the technical capability factor and that Modus21\u2019 s proposal was \u201ctechnically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s proposal under the \nstaffing plan factor remain undisturbed.  Under the technical understanding factor, the agency assigned two strengths and one weakness to Modus21\u2019s proposal, and no strengths and one weakness to the protester\u2019s proposal, concluding that Modus21\u2019s proposal --which merited strengths under both elements of the factor --\u201cprovides more  Page 15    B-423209.2; B -423209.3   benefit across more aspects\u201d of the technical understanding factor.  AR, Tab 6, SSDD \nat 15. \n \nEven assuming that the protester\u2019s proposal received a strength under element B1 for \nits comprehensive framework for achieving cATO , as the protester urges, the protester\u2019s \nproposal still would not offer strengths across both elements of the technical understanding factor, as the agency found supported its finding that Modus21\u2019s \nproposal  was technically superior  under that factor .  Furthermore, even if the technical \ngap between the two proposals were to narrow, such that the agency would have found that Modus21\u2019s proposal was only \u201cslightly technically superior\u201d to the protester\u2019s  \nproposal under the technical understanding factor , at most that would leave the \nproposals with offsetting advantages under the technical capability and technical \nunderstanding factors, which were equally important under the RFP\u2019s terms.   \nModus21\u2019s proposal therefore would have remained the technically superior offer, due to its unchallenged advantage under the staffing plan factor.   As the RFP provided that \nthe agency would issue the task order to the offeror whose proposal was technically superior with a fair and reasonable cost\/price, the protester cannot demonstrate that it would have had a substantial chance of award, even if its proposal had received this \nallegedly overlooked strength.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n "

        "Summary":"Protest that the agency unreasonably evaluated protester\u2019s proposal is denied where the record shows that the evaluation was consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  \nDECISION  \n Revolve Solutions, LLC, of Alexandria, Virginia, protests the award of a contract to Vistra Communications, LLC, of Lutz, Florida, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W9124J -25-R-0010, issued by the Department of the Army for commercial \ncommunication planning and support services.  Revolve argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  \n We deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nOn November 27, 2024, the Army issued the RFP to procure communication planning and support services for its Office of the Chief of Public Affairs.  Agency Report (AR) Tab 3a, RFP at 1, 60.\n1  The selected contractor would be required to provide operations \n \n1 When citing to the agency report, GAO utilizes the BATES page numbers provided by \nthe agency.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423450  support, as well as communications research, planning, and product development.  See \nid. at 81- 95.  The RFP contemplated the issuance of a fixed- price contract to be \nperformed over a 12- month base period and four 12- month option periods.  Id.  at 61.   \n The acquisition was conducted using the policies set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 in conjunction with the procedures under FAR part 15.  AR, Tab 3o, RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  Award would be made on a lowest -priced, technically \nacceptable (LPTA) basis considering technical capability, past performance, and cost\/price factors.  Id.  The technical capability factor included two subfactors:  technical \napproach, and staffing plan\/key personnel qualifications experience.  Id.   The technical \ncapability and past performance factors would be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.  at 11-12. \n Prior to the January 23, 2025, close of the solicitation period, 18 offerors, including Revolve and Vistra, submitted proposals.  AR, Tab 5e, Source Selection Decision at 1; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 5.  The Army evaluated Revolve\u2019s proposal  as \nunacceptable under the technical capability factor and the technical approach subfactor.  AR, Tab 5b, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at  33.  The evaluators \ndetermined that the firm did not demonstrate the ability to perform all the tas ks outlined \nin the PWS.  Id.; AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated Pre- negotiation Objective Memorandum\/ \nPrice Negotiation Memorandum (POM\/PNM) at 18.  Specifically, the Army concluded:  \n \n[Revolve\u2019s] proposal provided unacceptable evidence in their ability to perform and satisfy all contractual requirements of this solicitation.  The proposal does not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the tasks \noutlined in the PWS.  Offeror provi des minimal evidence of their ability to \nunderstand the development and execution of strategies, specifically for operations research, analysis and analytical expertise required for analytical communication and assessment [in accordance with (IAW)] PWS 5.3 .  They failed to address morning news reporting required daily \nand on the weekends, breaking news requirements and how they\u2019d support monthly media analysis across multiple social media platforms.  Offeror\u2019s proposal stated they would produce 40 communication plans per year, but the PWS requires up to 60 per year.  Offeror failed to address the Think Tank support requirement to execute 20 events on an annual basis as required in the PWS section 5.6.  \nId.  \n Ultimately, the agency evaluated three proposals as technically acceptable, including that of Vistra.  AR, Tab  5d, Consolidated POM\/PNM at 31.  The agency awarded the \ncontract to Vistra because its evaluated price of $12,818,454 was the lowest of the three.  Id.  This protest followed.  \n  Page 3 B-423450  DISCUSSION \n Revolve contends that the Army unreasonably evaluated its technical approach as unacceptable.  The firm argues its proposal demonstrated its capability to perform all the PWS functions.  Comments at 1- 9.  In so arguing, Revolve asserts that the Army \nunreas onably ignored or overlooked information contained in the firm\u2019s proposal.  See \nid.  The Army responds that Revolve\u2019s proposal simply lacked critical details explaining \nits specific approach to performing PWS \u00a7\u00a7 5.3, 5.4, and 5.6.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 10-28. \n We have reviewed the allegations and do not find that any provides us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We discuss the evaluation with respect to the various PWS sections separately, but note, at the outset that, in reviewing protests challenging an agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s eval uation \ncriteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.  AT&T Corp. , B-414886 et al. , \nOct. 5, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 330 at 6.  \n \nPWS Section 5.3, Communication Research, Analysis and Evaluation \n Section 5.3 of the PWS requires the contractor to advise and assist the agency with primary and secondary research to inform communication approaches and planning across the agency\u2019s media and community outreach activities.  RFP, amend. 4 at 35.  As releva nt here, section 5.3.8 requires the contractor to provide a daily digest of news \nmedia reporting that is cross -referenced with a Department of Defense daily news \nbriefing.  Id.  at 37.  Over the weekend, the contractor is required to provide two digests \nper day summarizing news media reporting.  Id.  \n Section 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor breaking news from all major news organizations websites and social media platforms daily, including the weekend.  RFP, amend. 4 at  37.  The contractor must maintain a \u201cBe on the Lookout\u201d (BOLO) list of \nbreaking news stories topics for agency leadership.  Id.   Also, the contractor must alert \nagency leadership when breaking news occurs, or when there is a development in any BOLO topic.  Id.   \n Section 5.3.10 requires the contractor to provide a monthly analysis of traditional media and social media in a single report.  RFP, amend. 4 at 37.  The monthly report will analyze the agency\u2019s messaging, and how the Army\u2019s news stories travel through soc ial \nmedia.  Id.    \n As relevant here, the RFP instructed offerors to submit technical volumes as part of their proposals.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The technical volume should be clear, concise, and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation.  Id.   Offerors were specifically \ninstructed that \u201c[t]he proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government\u2019s requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror  Page 4 B-423450  intends to meet these requirements.\u201d  Id.   When evaluating technical proposals, the \nRFP advised that the agency would consider the clarity and reasonableness of the \ntechnical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the performance work statement (PWS).  Id. at 10.  \n Revolve\u2019s proposal contains a section explaining the firm\u2019s approach to communication research, analysis and evaluation.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized \nat 11-16.\n2  The proposal discusses the firm\u2019s understanding of the agency\u2019s \nrequirement, as well as its knowledge and experience in this area.  Id.  at 11- 12.  The \nproposal also discusses the firm\u2019s capabilities, personnel, and approach to communications research and analysis.  Id.  at 12- 16. \n As stated above, the agency found the protester\u2019s proposal technically unacceptable.  The agency concluded that Revolve\u2019s proposal failed to address several functions, including the contractor\u2019s responsibility to produce daily digests, monitor breaking new s, \nand provide monthly reports.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM\/PNM at  18.  The agency \nconcluded that the firm\u2019s proposal lacked \u201cconvincing rationale and concrete details\u201d and generally restated the requirement without demonstrating the methodology.  COS at 9-10. \n Revolve argues that the firm\u2019s proposal contained adequate details demonstrating its compliance with the PWS requirements.  See  Comments at 2- 6.  For example, the firm \nargues that it demonstrated capability to produce the daily digests because its proposal showed that it has staff experienced with strenuous on- call work conditions and shows \nthat the firm sets an expectation that employees will be available on the weekend.  Id.  \nat 3.  Similarly, the firm argues that its proposal outlined tools and a research  monitoring \nprocess demonstrating compliance with the requirements for monitoring breaking news and producing monthly reports.  Id. at 5-6.  The Army counters that Revolve\u2019s proposal \ndid not contain sufficient details demonstrating the firm could fully accomplish the requisite functions.  MOL at 13- 23. \n On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation.  As explained above, the RFP instructed offerors to explain how they would satisfy all PWS \nrequirements and advised that proposals would be evaluated based on the reasonableness of the approach and ability to satisfy the complexity and magnitude of the requirement.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6, 10.  Despite that advisement, our reading of Revolve\u2019s proposal shows that the firm did not explain with sufficient detail how it would satisfy the tasks set forth under PWS section 5.3.8; indeed, our review shows that the \nproposal included only vague, tangential references indicating that the firm could and would provide daily digests but lacks any explanation describing how the firm would perform that fun ction.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 7 \n(\u201cmanagement staff is experienced with the need to be on- call 24\/7\/365, having \ndeveloped a reputation with our customers for providing short turnaround, quality \n \n2 As part of their proposals, offerors submitted \u201csanitized\u201d technical proposals which \nomitted the company\u2019s name, logo, and other markings.  RFP, amend. 4 at 3- 4.      Page 5 B-423450  deliverables\u201d), 15 (explaining that as part of the firm\u2019s media monitoring process, the \nfirm will develop a standard operating procedure ensuring \u201cthat checkpoints are included for daily and weekend monitoring and the BOLO list\u201d).  While Revolve points to proposal excerpts showing that the firm sets an expectation amongst its employees for weekend work and that the firm would revise the standard operating procedure to ensure that the digests are produced, such statements are consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation judgment that the firm merely demonstrated a commitment to perform the duties.  See Comments at 3.  Further, while the proposal describes a general process \nfor media monitoring, we agree with the agency that the proposal does not explain how the protester would accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement to produce the required digests.  See  COS at 9.  \n Likewise, our review of the firm\u2019s proposal shows it lacked details articulating its approach to performing PWS section 5.3.9.  While Revolve argues that its proposal referenced a particular tool (\u201cBrandwatch\u201d) that allows its employees to monitor news media, the proposal does not articulate how the firm would use this tool or the other tools (\u201cCisionOne\u201d and \u201cTVEyes\u201d) available to perform the specific duties under this section.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 12.  Indeed, whereas \nsection 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor news, develop the BOLO, and provide \nalerts to agency leadership, Revolve\u2019s proposal only explains that the firm has the general capability to monitor news media and will proactively engage senior agency personnel.  Id.  In other words, we agree with the agency that the proposal requires the \nreader to infer the connection between Revolve\u2019s general process and capabilities and the specific duties to be performed.  See  COS at 9.  Thus, because the RFP required \nofferors to demonstrate specifically how their proposals would accomplish the \ncomplexity and magnitude of the requirement, we have no basis to object to the evaluation.  \n As to PWS section 5.3.10, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the firm\u2019s proposal lacked details demonstrating specifically how the firm would produce the monthly report analyzing traditional and social media.  While Revolve points out that i ts \nproposal committed to providing monthly reports and discussed its media monitoring and social media process, see Comments at 4- 5 (citing AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. \nProposal --Sanitized at 14- 15), our review shows the proposal identified only a general \nmethod for monitoring news and social media and lacked details explaining how the firm \nwould produce the report.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  15 \n(\u201cSpecific to media analysis [PWS 5.3.6, 5.3.10, 5.3.15], [Revolve\u2019s] process leverages a com prehensive suite of media monitoring tools, enabling the Army to track local, \nnational, and industry coverage across television, radio, social media, print, and podcasts.\u201d).  Again, consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation, the firm\u2019s proposal simply explai ns its general capabilities but lacks any substantive discussion of how those \ncapabilities would be specifically employed to meet the agency\u2019s particular needs.  See  \nCOS at 10; see also MOL at 22- 23.  Thus, we find that the agency reasonably \nevaluated the firm\u2019s proposal as lacking details showing how the firm would fulfill the duties outlined in PWS section 5.3.  Accordingly, we deny the protest allegation.  \n  Page 6 B-423450  PWS Section 5.4, Communication Planning  \n \nSection 5.4 of the PWS describes the communication planning responsibilities the contractor must perform.  RFP, amend. 4 at 39.  Generally, this section requires the contractor to develop communication plans to include analyzing the information environment , determining current and upcoming phases of communication initiatives, \nand developing the metrics and performance objectives.  Id.  To develop the plans, the \ncontractor will need to research potential outreach events, analyze the implementation and execut ion of such events, and determine the likelihood of success.  Id.  Further, and \nas relevant here, the contractor shall be prepared to develop a minimum of 40 plans per year and a maximum of 60 plans per year.  Id. at 40. \n As noted above, when demonstrating their technical approach, offerors were instructed not to simply rephrase or restate the Government\u2019s requirements but rather to provide convincing rationale showing how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.  See  \nRFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The RFP advised that the agency would evaluate the clarity and reasonableness of the technical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the PWS.  Id. at 10.  \n In addressing the requirements set forth under PWS section 5.4, Revolve\u2019s proposal discusses the firm\u2019s understanding of the requirement and experience with communication plans.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  16-17.  The \nfirm also discus ses its capabilities and explains that the firm has standard plans that can \nassist the agency in \u201cdeveloping its more than 40 communications plans each year.\u201d  Id.  \nat 17.   \n \nAs explained above, the agency evaluated Revolve\u2019s proposal as not demonstrating \ncapability to support up to 60 plans per year.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM\/PNM at 18.  The agency explains that the proposal did not demonstrate its ability to handle \nthe \u201cf ull magnitude\u201d of the government\u2019s requirement.  COS at 11.  \n Revolve argues that the firm\u2019s proposal demonstrated willingness and ability to produce more than 40 plans per year, and therefore, the firm demonstrated compliance with the requirement to produce up to 60 plans per year.  See  Comments at 6 -7.  The Army \nresponds that the proposal did not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the requirement, and failed to provide sufficient detail regarding how it would accomplish between 40- 60 communication plans per year.  MOL at 24.  \n On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation because the RFP required offerors to articulate precisely how they would fulfill the duties outlined the PWS and our review shows that Revolve did not explain how it would develop 60 communication plans per year.  While Revolve\u2019s proposal demonstrated an \nunderstanding that the selected contractor may be required to produce more than 40 plans per year, the proposal did not specifically explain that the firm would be willing and able to produce 60 plans per year.

Revolve argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated its proposal.  \n We deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nOn November 27, 2024, the Army issued the RFP to procure communication planning and support services for its Office of the Chief of Public Affairs.  Agency Report (AR) Tab 3a, RFP at 1, 60.\n1  The selected contractor would be required to provide operations \n \n1 When citing to the agency report, GAO utilizes the BATES page numbers provided by \nthe agency.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423450  support, as well as communications research, planning, and product development.  See \nid. at 81- 95.  The RFP contemplated the issuance of a fixed- price contract to be \nperformed over a 12- month base period and four 12- month option periods.  Id.  at 61.   \n The acquisition was conducted using the policies set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 in conjunction with the procedures under FAR part 15.  AR, Tab 3o, RFP, amend. 4 at 10.  Award would be made on a lowest -priced, technically \nacceptable (LPTA) basis considering technical capability, past performance, and cost\/price factors.  Id.  The technical capability factor included two subfactors:  technical \napproach, and staffing plan\/key personnel qualifications experience.  Id.   The technical \ncapability and past performance factors would be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.  at 11-12. \n Prior to the January 23, 2025, close of the solicitation period, 18 offerors, including Revolve and Vistra, submitted proposals.  AR, Tab 5e, Source Selection Decision at 1; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 5.  The Army evaluated Revolve\u2019s proposal  as \nunacceptable under the technical capability factor and the technical approach subfactor.  AR, Tab 5b, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at  33.  The evaluators \ndetermined that the firm did not demonstrate the ability to perform all the tas ks outlined \nin the PWS.  Id.; AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated Pre- negotiation Objective Memorandum\/ \nPrice Negotiation Memorandum (POM\/PNM) at 18.  Specifically, the Army concluded:  \n \n[Revolve\u2019s] proposal provided unacceptable evidence in their ability to perform and satisfy all contractual requirements of this solicitation.  The proposal does not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the tasks \noutlined in the PWS.  Offeror provi des minimal evidence of their ability to \nunderstand the development and execution of strategies, specifically for operations research, analysis and analytical expertise required for analytical communication and assessment [in accordance with (IAW)] PWS 5.3 .  They failed to address morning news reporting required daily \nand on the weekends, breaking news requirements and how they\u2019d support monthly media analysis across multiple social media platforms.  Offeror\u2019s proposal stated they would produce 40 communication plans per year, but the PWS requires up to 60 per year.  Offeror failed to address the Think Tank support requirement to execute 20 events on an annual basis as required in the PWS section 5.6.  \nId.  \n Ultimately, the agency evaluated three proposals as technically acceptable, including that of Vistra.  AR, Tab  5d, Consolidated POM\/PNM at 31.  The agency awarded the \ncontract to Vistra because its evaluated price of $12,818,454 was the lowest of the three.  Id.  This protest followed.  \n  Page 3 B-423450  DISCUSSION \n Revolve contends that the Army unreasonably evaluated its technical approach as unacceptable.  The firm argues its proposal demonstrated its capability to perform all the PWS functions.  Comments at 1- 9.  In so arguing, Revolve asserts that the Army \nunreas onably ignored or overlooked information contained in the firm\u2019s proposal.  See \nid.  The Army responds that Revolve\u2019s proposal simply lacked critical details explaining \nits specific approach to performing PWS \u00a7\u00a7 5.3, 5.4, and 5.6.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 10-28. \n We have reviewed the allegations and do not find that any provides us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We discuss the evaluation with respect to the various PWS sections separately, but note, at the outset that, in reviewing protests challenging an agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not reevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we review the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019s eval uation \ncriteria, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.  AT&T Corp. , B-414886 et al. , \nOct. 5, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 330 at 6.  \n \nPWS Section 5.3, Communication Research, Analysis and Evaluation \n Section 5.3 of the PWS requires the contractor to advise and assist the agency with primary and secondary research to inform communication approaches and planning across the agency\u2019s media and community outreach activities.  RFP, amend. 4 at 35.  As releva nt here, section 5.3.8 requires the contractor to provide a daily digest of news \nmedia reporting that is cross -referenced with a Department of Defense daily news \nbriefing.  Id.  at 37.  Over the weekend, the contractor is required to provide two digests \nper day summarizing news media reporting.  Id.  \n Section 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor breaking news from all major news organizations websites and social media platforms daily, including the weekend.  RFP, amend. 4 at  37.  The contractor must maintain a \u201cBe on the Lookout\u201d (BOLO) list of \nbreaking news stories topics for agency leadership.  Id.   Also, the contractor must alert \nagency leadership when breaking news occurs, or when there is a development in any BOLO topic.  Id.   \n Section 5.3.10 requires the contractor to provide a monthly analysis of traditional media and social media in a single report.  RFP, amend. 4 at 37.  The monthly report will analyze the agency\u2019s messaging, and how the Army\u2019s news stories travel through soc ial \nmedia.  Id.    \n As relevant here, the RFP instructed offerors to submit technical volumes as part of their proposals.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The technical volume should be clear, concise, and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation.  Id.   Offerors were specifically \ninstructed that \u201c[t]he proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government\u2019s requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror  Page 4 B-423450  intends to meet these requirements.\u201d  Id.   When evaluating technical proposals, the \nRFP advised that the agency would consider the clarity and reasonableness of the \ntechnical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the performance work statement (PWS).  Id. at 10.  \n Revolve\u2019s proposal contains a section explaining the firm\u2019s approach to communication research, analysis and evaluation.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized \nat 11-16.\n2  The proposal discusses the firm\u2019s understanding of the agency\u2019s \nrequirement, as well as its knowledge and experience in this area.  Id.  at 11- 12.  The \nproposal also discusses the firm\u2019s capabilities, personnel, and approach to communications research and analysis.  Id.  at 12- 16. \n As stated above, the agency found the protester\u2019s proposal technically unacceptable.  The agency concluded that Revolve\u2019s proposal failed to address several functions, including the contractor\u2019s responsibility to produce daily digests, monitor breaking new s, \nand provide monthly reports.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM\/PNM at  18.  The agency \nconcluded that the firm\u2019s proposal lacked \u201cconvincing rationale and concrete details\u201d and generally restated the requirement without demonstrating the methodology.  COS at 9-10. \n Revolve argues that the firm\u2019s proposal contained adequate details demonstrating its compliance with the PWS requirements.  See  Comments at 2- 6.  For example, the firm \nargues that it demonstrated capability to produce the daily digests because its proposal showed that it has staff experienced with strenuous on- call work conditions and shows \nthat the firm sets an expectation that employees will be available on the weekend.  Id.  \nat 3.  Similarly, the firm argues that its proposal outlined tools and a research  monitoring \nprocess demonstrating compliance with the requirements for monitoring breaking news and producing monthly reports.  Id. at 5-6.  The Army counters that Revolve\u2019s proposal \ndid not contain sufficient details demonstrating the firm could fully accomplish the requisite functions.  MOL at 13- 23. \n On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation.  As explained above, the RFP instructed offerors to explain how they would satisfy all PWS \nrequirements and advised that proposals would be evaluated based on the reasonableness of the approach and ability to satisfy the complexity and magnitude of the requirement.  RFP, amend. 4 at 6, 10.  Despite that advisement, our reading of Revolve\u2019s proposal shows that the firm did not explain with sufficient detail how it would satisfy the tasks set forth under PWS section 5.3.8; indeed, our review shows that the \nproposal included only vague, tangential references indicating that the firm could and would provide daily digests but lacks any explanation describing how the firm would perform that fun ction.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 7 \n(\u201cmanagement staff is experienced with the need to be on- call 24\/7\/365, having \ndeveloped a reputation with our customers for providing short turnaround, quality \n \n2 As part of their proposals, offerors submitted \u201csanitized\u201d technical proposals which \nomitted the company\u2019s name, logo, and other markings.  RFP, amend. 4 at 3- 4.      Page 5 B-423450  deliverables\u201d), 15 (explaining that as part of the firm\u2019s media monitoring process, the \nfirm will develop a standard operating procedure ensuring \u201cthat checkpoints are included for daily and weekend monitoring and the BOLO list\u201d).  While Revolve points to proposal excerpts showing that the firm sets an expectation amongst its employees for weekend work and that the firm would revise the standard operating procedure to ensure that the digests are produced, such statements are consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation judgment that the firm merely demonstrated a commitment to perform the duties.  See Comments at 3.  Further, while the proposal describes a general process \nfor media monitoring, we agree with the agency that the proposal does not explain how the protester would accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement to produce the required digests.  See  COS at 9.  \n Likewise, our review of the firm\u2019s proposal shows it lacked details articulating its approach to performing PWS section 5.3.9.  While Revolve argues that its proposal referenced a particular tool (\u201cBrandwatch\u201d) that allows its employees to monitor news media, the proposal does not articulate how the firm would use this tool or the other tools (\u201cCisionOne\u201d and \u201cTVEyes\u201d) available to perform the specific duties under this section.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at 12.  Indeed, whereas \nsection 5.3.9 requires the contractor to monitor news, develop the BOLO, and provide \nalerts to agency leadership, Revolve\u2019s proposal only explains that the firm has the general capability to monitor news media and will proactively engage senior agency personnel.  Id.  In other words, we agree with the agency that the proposal requires the \nreader to infer the connection between Revolve\u2019s general process and capabilities and the specific duties to be performed.  See  COS at 9.  Thus, because the RFP required \nofferors to demonstrate specifically how their proposals would accomplish the \ncomplexity and magnitude of the requirement, we have no basis to object to the evaluation.  \n As to PWS section 5.3.10, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the firm\u2019s proposal lacked details demonstrating specifically how the firm would produce the monthly report analyzing traditional and social media.  While Revolve points out that i ts \nproposal committed to providing monthly reports and discussed its media monitoring and social media process, see Comments at 4- 5 (citing AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. \nProposal --Sanitized at 14- 15), our review shows the proposal identified only a general \nmethod for monitoring news and social media and lacked details explaining how the firm \nwould produce the report.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  15 \n(\u201cSpecific to media analysis [PWS 5.3.6, 5.3.10, 5.3.15], [Revolve\u2019s] process leverages a com prehensive suite of media monitoring tools, enabling the Army to track local, \nnational, and industry coverage across television, radio, social media, print, and podcasts.\u201d).  Again, consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation, the firm\u2019s proposal simply explai ns its general capabilities but lacks any substantive discussion of how those \ncapabilities would be specifically employed to meet the agency\u2019s particular needs.  See  \nCOS at 10; see also MOL at 22- 23.  Thus, we find that the agency reasonably \nevaluated the firm\u2019s proposal as lacking details showing how the firm would fulfill the duties outlined in PWS section 5.3.  Accordingly, we deny the protest allegation.  \n  Page 6 B-423450  PWS Section 5.4, Communication Planning  \n \nSection 5.4 of the PWS describes the communication planning responsibilities the contractor must perform.  RFP, amend. 4 at 39.  Generally, this section requires the contractor to develop communication plans to include analyzing the information environment , determining current and upcoming phases of communication initiatives, \nand developing the metrics and performance objectives.  Id.  To develop the plans, the \ncontractor will need to research potential outreach events, analyze the implementation and execut ion of such events, and determine the likelihood of success.  Id.  Further, and \nas relevant here, the contractor shall be prepared to develop a minimum of 40 plans per year and a maximum of 60 plans per year.  Id. at 40. \n As noted above, when demonstrating their technical approach, offerors were instructed not to simply rephrase or restate the Government\u2019s requirements but rather to provide convincing rationale showing how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.  See  \nRFP, amend. 4 at 6.  The RFP advised that the agency would evaluate the clarity and reasonableness of the technical approach to accomplish the complexity and magnitude of the requirement, including all tasks outlined in the PWS.  Id. at 10.  \n In addressing the requirements set forth under PWS section 5.4, Revolve\u2019s proposal discusses the firm\u2019s understanding of the requirement and experience with communication plans.  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --Sanitized at  16-17.  The \nfirm also discus ses its capabilities and explains that the firm has standard plans that can \nassist the agency in \u201cdeveloping its more than 40 communications plans each year.\u201d  Id.  \nat 17.   \n \nAs explained above, the agency evaluated Revolve\u2019s proposal as not demonstrating \ncapability to support up to 60 plans per year.  AR, Tab 5d, Consolidated POM\/PNM at 18.  The agency explains that the proposal did not demonstrate its ability to handle \nthe \u201cf ull magnitude\u201d of the government\u2019s requirement.  COS at 11.  \n Revolve argues that the firm\u2019s proposal demonstrated willingness and ability to produce more than 40 plans per year, and therefore, the firm demonstrated compliance with the requirement to produce up to 60 plans per year.  See  Comments at 6 -7.  The Army \nresponds that the proposal did not demonstrate a high level of understanding of the requirement, and failed to provide sufficient detail regarding how it would accomplish between 40- 60 communication plans per year.  MOL at 24.  \n On this record, we have no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation because the RFP required offerors to articulate precisely how they would fulfill the duties outlined the PWS and our review shows that Revolve did not explain how it would develop 60 communication plans per year.  While Revolve\u2019s proposal demonstrated an \nunderstanding that the selected contractor may be required to produce more than 40 plans per year, the proposal did not specifically explain that the firm would be willing and able to produce 60 plans per year.  See  AR, Tab 4d, Revolve Tech. Proposal --\nSanitized at 17.  More importantly, our review confirms the agency\u2019s conclusion that  Page 7 B-423450  Revolve did not articulate how its capabilities would allow the firm to develop 60 plans \nper year.  Id.  Indeed, our reading of the firm\u2019s proposal shows that the firm articulated \nits general capabilities ( e.g., having long- form and short -form planning templates), \nfamiliarity with the Army\u2019s structure, and communication strategists as beneficial features, but omitted any discussion explaining how these features would fare when required to produce a significantly  higher number of plans.  See id.  at 17- 18.  G iven the \nlack of clarity and supporting information, we do not find that the agency unreasonably evaluated Revolve\u2019s proposal.  Cf.

Protest alleging that the agency was required to refer the firm\u2019s eligibility for award to the Small Business Administration for a certificate of competency determination is \ndenied where the agency \u2019s elimination of the protester\u2019s quotation for failure to comply \nwith solicitation instructions did not constitute a responsibilit y determination. \nDECISION  \n RiverNorth, Inc., a small business of Sterling, Virginia, protests the elimination of its \nquotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) for program support to various USDA missions, \nincluding farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency\u2019s decision to eliminate its quotation for failing to comply with the solicitation\u2019s font size requirements was (1)  unreasonable and contrary to the terms of the solicitation, \n(2) improper because it resulted from a latent ambiguity  with the terms of the \nsolicitation , (3) unfair because USDA treat ed vendors unequally when it  allowed another \nvendor to correct an error with its quotation through discussions but did not also hold discussions with the protester, and (4) contrary to applicable procurement regulations DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release . \n \n  Page 2 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  because the agency was required to obtain a certificate of the protester\u2019s competency \nfrom the Small Business Administration (SBA) before eliminating its quotation and the agency failed to do so.  See  Protest at 1- 2; Supp. Protest at 1.   \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through the General Services \nAdministration \u2019s electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the \nfederal supply schedule (FSS) procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \nsubpart 8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Exh. 7 .2, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 47- 48; AR, Exh. 3, \nDetermination of Compliance Review at 1.\n1  The solicitation contemplated the \nestablishment of a multiple award, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year \nperiod of performance.  RFQ  at 1, 48.  \n The RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to \nevaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past \nperformance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach \nfactor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflicts o f interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and \nrisk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal \nimportance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   \n Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  \n \nThe [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the \nGovernment can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  \nTherefore, the [vendor] \u2019s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of \nspelling and grammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the \nGovernment will expect from awardees.  The [vendor] \u2019s ability to  follow the \ninstructions contained herein is a demonstration of the [vendor] \u2019s ability to  \nfollow instructions in general, which is paramount to acceptable performance.  \n The [vendor]\u2019 s attention to detail is important to the Government as a \nsignificant amount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work \nstatement]  will require the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including \nquality control.  If a[] [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not \nfollowing  the directions contained herein, the [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] \nshall be ineligible for award.  \n \n \n1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  RFQ at 47.  \n \nThe RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation required vendors to submit quotations \u201cin accordance with the format and content specified in the solicitation.\u201d  Id.  at 51.  Specifically, text size \n\u201cmust be 12- point or larger, using Times New Roman font\u201d and \u201c[o]nly page numbers, \nheaders and footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, \nTimes New Roman[] font requirement.  Id.      \n The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the formatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  \n \nAny [Vendor][] quot[ations] determined non- compliant with the terms noted \nin this RFQ will not be evaluated and further considered for award.  I n \naddition, a quot[ation]  may be eliminated from further consideration before \nthe initial rating if the quot[ation]  has one or more deficiencies . . . . \n \n* * * * * \n \nThe [vendor]\u2019s quot[ation] must include all information requested and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions.  Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to furnish a complete quot[ation] . . . shall result in the quot[ation] being unacceptable to the Government and will eliminate the [Vendor] from further \nconsideration for award.  \n \n* * * * * \n \n[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or \ndeficient and will be considered ineligible for award.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA quot [ation]  will be deemed unacceptable if it does not represent a \nreasonable effort to address the essential requirements of the solicitation, \nor if it does not comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this \nsolicitation.  \n Id. at 47-48, 51, 64.  \n In the section explaining how the agency would evaluate quotations, the solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  \n  Page 4 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  A deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of \nthe Request for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or \nunacceptable within this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  \n[Vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is determined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s \nare cautioned to ensure all the solicitation requirements are met.   \n[Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention to the details of this \nsolicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] \u2019s ability to follow explicit instructions is \ncritical to the performance of the resulting orders from this award.  \n \nA quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .\u201d  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA failure to provide the information called for . . .  or a failure to provide the information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . . The evaluation of a[]  [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  will end upon \na determination that  the [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  \n Id. at 63-64. \n The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s \nto determine whether quotations  were \u201ccompliant with the criteria and instructions of the \nRFQ,\u201d unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined \ndeficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law \n(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 11.2, \nNotice of E limination .   \n \nAfter the initial compliance review of RiverNorth\u2019s quotation, the agency determined that the protester\u2019s quotation failed to comply with the formatting instructions because it included page numbers in font sizes less than 12- point font in the page footers of the \n\u201csubfactor 1 portion of [its] Volume III [quotation] . . . .\u201d  AR, Exh. 11.2, Notice of \nElimination.   Upon notification of its elimination, RiverNorth filed this protest on \nJanuary  10, 2025.    \n DISCUSSION  The protester alleges that the agency \u201cacted unreasonably by improperly rejecting RiverNorth\u2019s quot[ation] as materially  non-compliant.\u201d  Protest at 12.  In this regard, \nRiverNorth claims the agency deviated from the solicitation\u2019s terms when it eliminated the protester\u2019s quotation over an \u201cincredibly minor\u201d and \u201cnon- material\u201d font size in \u201cone \nportion of one volume\u201d of its  quotation that \u201ccould not have been anticipated from the \nexpress language of the RFQ.\u201d  Id.   In the alternative, the protester contends  the \nsolicitation contained a latent ambiguity.  Id. at 15.  RiverNorth also argues that the \nagency engaged in unequal treatment and lastly that the agency failed to refer its  Page 5 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  quotation to the SBA for a certificate of competency ( COC)  determination.  Supp. \nProtest at 2- 3; Protest at 12.   \n \nFor the reasons explained below, we find no basis to sustain any of the challenges raised by the protester.\n 2 \n \nSolicitation Formatting Instructions  \n \nThe protester alleges that the agency acted unreasonably and deviated from the evaluation criteria in eliminating its quotation from the competition because the \nsolicitation instructions did not \u201cclearly put [vendor]s on notice that something as non-\nmateri al as a font in a footer would result in quot[ation] rejection.\u201d  Protest at 13.  \nRiverNorth explains that while the solicitation discusses font size requirements, the RFQ fails to explain that non- compliance with the font formatting instructions would be \ntreated as a \u201cdeficiency or as a \u201cmaterial non- compliance.\u201d  Id.  By comparison, the \nprotester points to other sections of the solicitation--e.g. , page limits and prohibition of \npictures with text, that clearly inform vendors that errors would lead to a quotation deficiency.  Id.  at 14 (citing RFQ at 64).  Furthermore, the protester asserts that the \nRFQ \u201cmakes it clear\u201d that a quotation must include multiple errors related to \u201cdirections\u201d to be deemed ineligible.  Id. (citing RFQ at 47); Comments at 6.  Sta ted otherwise, the \nRFQ did not \u201cdirectly state that a single error in font size in a footer was a criterion for automatic rejection.\u201d  Protest at 14.    \n The agency contends that the RFQ instructions for font size and type requirements were clear and that it properly eliminated RiverNorth\u2019s quotation because the solicitation \nwarned that vendors would be ineligible for award if vendors did not comply with the \nRFQ\u2019s detailed formatting instructions.  See Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 3 -\n4.  Furthermore, the contracting officer states that the solicitation \u201cwas designed to select only those contractors capable of following detailed instructions\u201d and t hat the \nRFQ \u201cstates the importance of a [vendor\u2019s] ability to follow detailed instructions.\u201d  Id.   \nat 2, 6.  Moreover, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d instead of discretionary terms such as \u201cmay\u201d which was an \u201cintentional and deliberate deviation\u201d from previous solicitations that was \u201cmade to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor\u2019s] ability to follow directions.\u201d  Id.  at 6-7.   \n Where, as here, an agency issues a solicitation to FSS vendors under the provisions of FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the establishment of a BPA, our Office will not reevaluate the quotations; rather, we review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and \napplicable procurement laws and regulations .  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches , \nInc., B-418823.3, B -418823.4, Jan. 8, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 18 at 4.  \n \n \n2 RiverNorth raises additional collateral protest arguments.  While we do not address \nevery argument raised, we have considered all of the protest allegations and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  On this record, we find that the agency\u2019s rejection of RiverNorth\u2019s quotation was in \naccordance with the terms of the solicitation.  As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for text size and fonts, specifically stating that \u201c[t]ext size must be \n12-point or larger, using Times New Roman font\u201d and \u201c[o]nly page numbers, headers \nand footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, Times \nNew Roman[] font requirement.\u201d  RFQ at 51.   On the same page as these formatting \ninstructions, the solicitation stated that \u201c[vendors] that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non-responsive or deficient and will be considered ineligible for award.\u201d  Id.    \n Furthermore, as noted above, t he RFQ included several other sections, emphasizing \nthat failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a \ndeficiency ,\u201d which mandated elimination from the competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  \nGiven this language, the agency\u2019s decision to eliminate RiverNorth\u2019s quotation for its failure, however minor, to follow the quotation formatting instructions, was in accordance with the solicitation terms.  While the protester argues that  quotations would \nbe defi cient, and eliminated, under the terms of the RFQ only if they had multiple errors, \nwe do not agree with RiverNorth\u2019s contention that the solicitation required \u201cmultiple errors\u201d to be eliminated from the competition.  The solicitation instead referred to the \nrequirement that vendors follow all solicitation instructions, and that any error attributed to a vendor\u2019s failure to follow solicitation instructions would result in its elimination from the competition.  Stated otherwise, the plural form of errors in the RFQ instructions, \u201c [i]f \na [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  has errors attributed to not following the directions contained \nherein, the [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation shall be ineligible for award,\u201d refers to either single or \nmultiple errors.  See  RFQ at 47.     \n The protester also contends that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity because it was unclear what constituted a \u201cdeficiency\u201d that warranted rejection of a quotation.  Protest at 15.  RiverNorth argues that \u201cthe RFQ stated a deficiency could lead to quot[ation]  rejection.  However, it  doesn\u2019t directly define such term until multiple pages \nlater, indicating these two RFQ terms aren\u2019t  even related. \u201d  Id.   \n In response, the agency contends that the solicitation was clear and unambiguous.  The agency maintains that RiverNorth\u2019s argument regarding the definition of a deficiency \u201cmakes no sense, as throughout the RFQ the definition of deficiency, and its location relative to its use in the RFQ, is referenced consistently.\u201d  MOL at 7.  \n Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation \nmust be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 163 at 5.  An \nambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the terms or specifica tions of the solicitation are possible.  The HP Grp., LLC , B-415285, Dec. 14, \n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 385 at 5.  A patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error, while a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.   Where  Page 7 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  there is a latent ambiguity, both parties\u2019 interpretations of the provision may be \nreasonable, and the appropriate course of action is to clarify the requirement and afford offerors an opportunity to submit proposals based on the clarified requirement.  Qwest Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc . d\/b\/a CenturyLink QGS , B-419597, B -419597.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 217 at 5 n.7.  \n Based on our review of the record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity  as \nalleged by RiverNorth.   The protester\u2019s interpretation ignores the clear and unequivocal \nsolicitation language that explained the required font size and type requirements.   See \nRFQ at 51.   As explained above, the RFQ informed vendors that \u201ca failure to provide the \ninformation in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency.\u201d  RFQ at 64.  The fact that the definition of deficiency was found multiple pages after the \nsolicitation first notified vendors that a deficiency would lead to elimination of a quotation does not create any ambiguity.  Moreover, as the agency points out, RiverNorth\u2019s argument ignores the multiple different places where t he solicitation stated that failure to \nfollow quotation formatting instructions would be considered a deficiency.  Consequently, the solicitation was not latently ambiguous as alleged by the protester \nand t his protest allegation is denied.  \n Unequal Treatment  \n RiverNorth alleges that the USDA treated vendors unequally by engaging in discussions with only one vendor.  Supp. Protest at 2.  In this regard, the protester contends that one of the vendors was permitted to provide explanations for why it should not have been eliminated and eventually the agency allowed that vendor back in the competition.  \nId. at 4.  RiverNorth asserts that the eliminated vendor provided:  \u201cA detailed \nwalkthrough of a quot[ation] that no other [vendor] was given the opportunity to provide.  It is essentially a presentation and argument \u2013 a sales pitch essentially \u2013  of the RFQ \ncompliance of the quot[ation], in written form.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 4.  Furthermore, RiverNorth contends that it should have been provided the \u201csame opportunity to revise \nits quot[ation] through discussions\u201d to resolve \u201cany lingering concerns from the USDA, \nincluding any footer text size issues found in its quot[ation].\u201d  Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  \n As explained above, after an initial compliance review, the agency sent unsuccessful notices to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for the BPA.  As  relevant to this protest ground, the agency \neliminated another vendor for including a chart in its quotation \u201cas an image with text.\u201d  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.  The unsuccessful notices to vendors, including to RiverNorth, did not request or otherwise invite a response.  However, the other vendor sent a letter to the agency arguing that its quotation was \ncompliant with the solicitation and that the agency\u2019s decision for elimination of its quotation was erroneous.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal Letter at 1.  In this regard, the vendor explained that the chart at issue was not a prohibited picture with text, but instead a chart that was \u201cfully editable in [Microsoft] Word as text\u201d which was compliant with solicitation instructions.  Id. at 5; s ee RFQ at 51.  The vendor asked that the agency \nreconsider its decision to eliminate the vendor\u2019s quotation.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal  Page 8 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Letter at 1.  Following receipt and review of this vendor\u2019s rebuttal letter, the agency \nconcluded that the table was editable and permitted the vendor back in the competition.  AR, Exh. 13.2, Agency Response to Vendor Rebuttal Letter; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.   \n The protester asserts that above- described communications constituted discussions \nbecause the eliminated vendor\u2019s \u201cexplanations, arguments, and sales -pitch of \ncompliance and [the] RFQ terms to the USDA caused the [agency] to take separate actions to test i tems and further evaluate the quot[ation] for acceptability.\u201d  Supp. \nComments at 4.  In support of its argument, RiverNorth relies on our decision Spry \nMethods, Inc ., where our Office found that \u201cdiscussions occur when an agency \ncommunicates with a vendor for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determine the acceptability of a quotation,  or provides  the vendor with an opportunity to \nrevise or modify its quotation in some material respect.\u201d   Id. at 3 (quoting Spry Methods, \nInc.-Costs, B-417800.3, Feb.  14, 2020, 2020  CPD \u00b6 83  at 6).  RiverNorth maintains that \nthis constitutes unequal treatment because it was not provided with an opportunity to respond to the unsuccessful notice.       \n     \nIn response, USDA contends that it did not engage in discussions with the re- admitted \nvendor because it did not permit the vendor to revise its quotation.  Supp. MOL at 1- 2.  \nThe agency explains that \u201cthe agency\u2019s evaluation team determined that the error that \nwas originally assigned to the re- admitted [vendor]\u2019s quot[ation] was incorrectly \nassigned, as the chart include[d] in the re- admitted [vendor]\u2019s quot[ation] was in fact not \na prohibited picture with text.\u201d  Id.  at 2.  Instead, the agency contends that it \u201cupheld its \nresponsibility to treat all [vendors] fairly under the RFQ instructions \u201d when it decided to \nre-admit the vendor.  Id.      \n There is no requirement in FAR subpart 8.4 that an agency seek clarifications or otherwise conduct discussions with vendors.  Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc.,  B-421979.4, \nMay 7, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 114 at 5 n.4; Aurotech, Inc. , B-413861.4, June  23, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6 205 at 10.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance i n making \nthis determination.  Id .  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as \u201climited \nexchanges\u201d that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this case quotations) or to resolve minor or clerical mistakes.  See FAR \n15.306(a)(1), (2); Diversified Collection Servs., Inc. , B-406958.3, B -406958.4, Jan. 8, \n2013, 2013 CPD \u00b6 23 at 11 (using FAR part 15 definitions of post -proposal \ncommunications, or exchanges, as guidance in FSS context).   Discussions allow an \nagency  to communicate with offerors  to obtain information essential for determining the \nacceptability of proposals , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify their \nproposals .  See FAR 15.306(d); JHC Technology, Inc ., B-417786, Oct. 23, 2019, 2019 \nCPD \u00b6 376 at 4 -5; Pontiac Flying LLC , B-414433 et al.,  June 12, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 188 \nat 6-7.   \n  Page 9 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Based on our review of the record, we disagree with RiverNorth\u2019s  interpretation that \ndiscussions occurred here.  As provided above, discussions allow an agency  to \ncommunicate with vendors to obtain information essential for determining the \nacceptability of  quotations , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify  its \nquotations .  See FAR \u00a7 15.306(d); see also JHC Technology, Inc ., supra at 4-5.  Here, \nthe re- admitted vendor did not change its quotation, rather, it notified the USDA of an \nerror with its evaluation and requested relief.3  In comparison, RiverNorth\u2019s quotation \nwould have required a change, a correction to font size errors, to be considered \ncompliant with the solicitation requirements.    Moreover, we find RiverNorth\u2019s reliance on the Spry Methods  decision misplaced.  This \ncase is distinguishable as the agency  in Spry Methods  initiated communications with the \nvendor, whereas here, the agency did not request any response from the vendors, but rather the other vendor  independently  contact ed USDA.   See Spry Methods, Inc. -Costs, \nsupra at 6-8.  Furthermore, RiverNorth\u2019s argument that the re- admitted vendor\u2019s \nexplanation of why its quotation complied with the solicitation constituted discussions ignores the \u201cacid test\u201d explained in Spry Methods to  determine whether discussions \nhave occurred --e.g. , \u201cwhether a vendor has been afforded an opportunity to revise or \nmodify its quotation.\u201d  Id.  at 6.  Here, the eliminated vendor did not revise or modify its \nquotation in response to the unsuccessful notice.  On this record, RiverNorth has failed to establish that the agency engaged in unequal discussions or treatment; as a result, this protest al legation is denied.   \n SBA Referral   \nFinally, RiverNorth asserts that the agency could not eliminate its quotation without first \nreferring its eligibility for award to the  SBA for a COC determination.  Protest at 19 -20.  \nThe protester alleges that USDA eliminated its quotation based on a \u201cpass\/fail\u201d basis that was aimed at capability and responsibility and therefore it is analogous to a \nresponsibility determination that required the agency to refer the protester to the SBA for a COC.  Id.  at 19; Comments at 14.  The agency contends it was not required to \nseek a COC as RiverNorth\u2019s quotation was eliminated for failing to follow the solicitation\u2019s instructions, rather than a matter of responsibility.

Along these same lines, where an agency finds a \nquotation to be unacceptable based on a vendor\u2019s failure to adhere to the solicitation\u2019s font size instructions,  the finding does not constitute a determination that the vendor is \nnot a responsible prospective contractor.  Id.     \n On the record here, we do not agree with the protester\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s rejection of its quotation involved a responsibility determination that required referral to the SBA.

Protest alleging that the agency was required to refer the firm\u2019s eligibility for award to the Small Business Administration for a certificate of competency determination is \ndenied where the agency \u2019s elimination of the protester\u2019s quotation for failure to comply \nwith solicitation instructions did not constitute a responsibilit y determination. \nDECISION  \n RiverNorth, Inc., a small business of Sterling, Virginia, protests the elimination of its \nquotation under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  12SAD225Q0001, issued by the \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) for program support to various USDA missions, \nincluding farm production and conservation.  The protester argues that the agency\u2019s decision to eliminate its quotation for failing to comply with the solicitation\u2019s font size requirements was (1)  unreasonable and contrary to the terms of the solicitation, \n(2) improper because it resulted from a latent ambiguity  with the terms of the \nsolicitation , (3) unfair because USDA treat ed vendors unequally when it  allowed another \nvendor to correct an error with its quotation through discussions but did not also hold discussions with the protester, and (4) contrary to applicable procurement regulations DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release . \n \n  Page 2 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  because the agency was required to obtain a certificate of the protester\u2019s competency \nfrom the Small Business Administration (SBA) before eliminating its quotation and the agency failed to do so.  See  Protest at 1- 2; Supp. Protest at 1.   \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On October 15, 2024, USDA issued the RFQ through the General Services \nAdministration \u2019s electronic system, eBuy, as a small business set -aside pursuant to the \nfederal supply schedule (FSS) procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \nsubpart 8.4.  Agency Report (AR), Exh. 7 .2, RFQ  amend. 0002 at 47- 48; AR, Exh. 3, \nDetermination of Compliance Review at 1.\n1  The solicitation contemplated the \nestablishment of a multiple award, blanket purchase agreement (BPA)  for a 5 -year \nperiod of performance.  RFQ  at 1, 48.  \n The RFQ advised that USDA would establish up to seven BPAs with award to be made on a best -value tradeoff  basis .  RFQ at 63.  The following factors would be used to \nevaluate quotations:  past performance, technical approach, and price.  Id.   Past \nperformance was to be rated acceptable or unacceptable; a vendor had to receive an acceptable rating under this factor to be eligible for award.  Id.  The technical approach \nfactor had two subfactors, project and portfolio management, and organizational conflicts o f interest.  Id.  at 65.  Each subfactor would receive a combined technical and \nrisk rating.  Id.  The solicitation explained that these two subfactors were of equal \nimportance, and when combined were more important than price.  Id. at 63.   \n Relevant here, under the general instructions for quotations, the RFQ provided:  \n \nThe [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  represents the quality of the performance the \nGovernment can expect in the performance of work under this BPA.  \nTherefore, the [vendor] \u2019s ability to  present a quality quot [ation] , free of \nspelling and grammatical errors is a reflection of the quality of work the \nGovernment will expect from awardees.  The [vendor] \u2019s ability to  follow the \ninstructions contained herein is a demonstration of the [vendor] \u2019s ability to  \nfollow instructions in general, which is paramount to acceptable performance.  \n The [vendor]\u2019 s attention to detail is important to the Government as a \nsignificant amount  of work under the attached PWS  [performance work \nstatement]  will require the [vendor]  to follow detailed instructions,  including \nquality control.  If a[] [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has errors attributed to not \nfollowing  the directions contained herein, the [vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] \nshall be ineligible for award.  \n \n \n1 Citations to the record reference the Adobe PDF document  page numbers.   Page 3 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  RFQ at 47.  \n \nThe RFQ included specific instructions regarding quotation formatting.  As relevant to this protest, the solicitation required vendors to submit quotations \u201cin accordance with the format and content specified in the solicitation.\u201d  Id.  at 51.  Specifically, text size \n\u201cmust be 12- point or larger, using Times New Roman font\u201d and \u201c[o]nly page numbers, \nheaders and footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, \nTimes New Roman[] font requirement.  Id.      \n The solicitation also repeatedly warned vendors of the importance of following the formatting instructions and that failure to do so would result in elimination of the quotation from the competition.  For example, the solicitation stated:  \n \nAny [Vendor][] quot[ations] determined non- compliant with the terms noted \nin this RFQ will not be evaluated and further considered for award.  I n \naddition, a quot[ation]  may be eliminated from further consideration before \nthe initial rating if the quot[ation]  has one or more deficiencies . . . . \n \n* * * * * \n \nThe [vendor]\u2019s quot[ation] must include all information requested and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions.  Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to furnish a complete quot[ation] . . . shall result in the quot[ation] being unacceptable to the Government and will eliminate the [Vendor] from further \nconsideration for award.  \n \n* * * * * \n \n[Vendor]s that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non- responsive or \ndeficient and will be considered ineligible for award.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA quot [ation]  will be deemed unacceptable if it does not represent a \nreasonable effort to address the essential requirements of the solicitation, \nor if it does not comply with the quot[ation] preparation instructions of this \nsolicitation.  \n Id. at 47-48, 51, 64.  \n In the section explaining how the agency would evaluate quotations, the solicitation defined deficiency, and again warned vendors of the failure to follow instructions, as follows:  \n  Page 4 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  A deficiency is a material failure of a quot [ation]  to meet a requirement of \nthe Request for  Quotation.   A deficiency is also called noncompliant or \nunacceptable within this  solicitation.  No award will be made to a[]  \n[Vendor]  whose quot [ation]  is determined to have a deficienc y.  [Vendor] s \nare cautioned to ensure all the solicitation requirements are met.   \n[Vendor] s are cautioned to pay attention to the details of this \nsolicitation, as a[ ] [Vendor] \u2019s ability to follow explicit instructions is \ncritical to the performance of the resulting orders from this award.  \n \nA quot[ation] will be eliminated from further consideration before complete evaluation if the [q]uotation is deficient. . . .\u201d  \n \n* * * * * \n \nA failure to provide the information called for . . .  or a failure to provide the information in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency. . . . The evaluation of a[]  [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  will end upon \na determination that  the [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation] has a deficiency.  \n Id. at 63-64. \n The agency received 48 quotations.  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 1.  On December 30, 2024, after the agency completed contract compliance review s \nto determine whether quotations  were \u201ccompliant with the criteria and instructions of the \nRFQ,\u201d unsuccessful notices were sent to vendors whose quotations were determined \ndeficient and removed from further consideration for BPA award.  Memorandum of Law \n(MOL) at 2; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5; AR, Exh. 11.2, \nNotice of E limination .   \n \nAfter the initial compliance review of RiverNorth\u2019s quotation, the agency determined that the protester\u2019s quotation failed to comply with the formatting instructions because it included page numbers in font sizes less than 12- point font in the page footers of the \n\u201csubfactor 1 portion of [its] Volume III [quotation] . . . .\u201d  AR, Exh. 11.2, Notice of \nElimination.   Upon notification of its elimination, RiverNorth filed this protest on \nJanuary  10, 2025.    \n DISCUSSION  The protester alleges that the agency \u201cacted unreasonably by improperly rejecting RiverNorth\u2019s quot[ation] as materially  non-compliant.\u201d  Protest at 12.  In this regard, \nRiverNorth claims the agency deviated from the solicitation\u2019s terms when it eliminated the protester\u2019s quotation over an \u201cincredibly minor\u201d and \u201cnon- material\u201d font size in \u201cone \nportion of one volume\u201d of its  quotation that \u201ccould not have been anticipated from the \nexpress language of the RFQ.\u201d  Id.   In the alternative, the protester contends  the \nsolicitation contained a latent ambiguity.  Id. at 15.  RiverNorth also argues that the \nagency engaged in unequal treatment and lastly that the agency failed to refer its  Page 5 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  quotation to the SBA for a certificate of competency ( COC)  determination.  Supp. \nProtest at 2- 3; Protest at 12.   \n \nFor the reasons explained below, we find no basis to sustain any of the challenges raised by the protester.\n 2 \n \nSolicitation Formatting Instructions  \n \nThe protester alleges that the agency acted unreasonably and deviated from the evaluation criteria in eliminating its quotation from the competition because the \nsolicitation instructions did not \u201cclearly put [vendor]s on notice that something as non-\nmateri al as a font in a footer would result in quot[ation] rejection.\u201d  Protest at 13.  \nRiverNorth explains that while the solicitation discusses font size requirements, the RFQ fails to explain that non- compliance with the font formatting instructions would be \ntreated as a \u201cdeficiency or as a \u201cmaterial non- compliance.\u201d  Id.  By comparison, the \nprotester points to other sections of the solicitation--e.g. , page limits and prohibition of \npictures with text, that clearly inform vendors that errors would lead to a quotation deficiency.  Id.  at 14 (citing RFQ at 64).  Furthermore, the protester asserts that the \nRFQ \u201cmakes it clear\u201d that a quotation must include multiple errors related to \u201cdirections\u201d to be deemed ineligible.  Id. (citing RFQ at 47); Comments at 6.  Sta ted otherwise, the \nRFQ did not \u201cdirectly state that a single error in font size in a footer was a criterion for automatic rejection.\u201d  Protest at 14.    \n The agency contends that the RFQ instructions for font size and type requirements were clear and that it properly eliminated RiverNorth\u2019s quotation because the solicitation \nwarned that vendors would be ineligible for award if vendors did not comply with the \nRFQ\u2019s detailed formatting instructions.  See Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 3 -\n4.  Furthermore, the contracting officer states that the solicitation \u201cwas designed to select only those contractors capable of following detailed instructions\u201d and t hat the \nRFQ \u201cstates the importance of a [vendor\u2019s] ability to follow detailed instructions.\u201d  Id.   \nat 2, 6.  Moreover, the agency explains that the instructions used words such as \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d instead of discretionary terms such as \u201cmay\u201d which was an \u201cintentional and deliberate deviation\u201d from previous solicitations that was \u201cmade to emphasize the criticality of the [vendor\u2019s] ability to follow directions.\u201d  Id.  at 6-7.   \n Where, as here, an agency issues a solicitation to FSS vendors under the provisions of FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the establishment of a BPA, our Office will not reevaluate the quotations; rather, we review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and \napplicable procurement laws and regulations .  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches , \nInc., B-418823.3, B -418823.4, Jan. 8, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 18 at 4.  \n \n \n2 RiverNorth raises additional collateral protest arguments.  While we do not address \nevery argument raised, we have considered all of the protest allegations and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  On this record, we find that the agency\u2019s rejection of RiverNorth\u2019s quotation was in \naccordance with the terms of the solicitation.  As explained above, the RFQ addressed formatting instructions for text size and fonts, specifically stating that \u201c[t]ext size must be \n12-point or larger, using Times New Roman font\u201d and \u201c[o]nly page numbers, headers \nand footers may be within the page margins and must use the same [] 12- point, Times \nNew Roman[] font requirement.\u201d  RFQ at 51.   On the same page as these formatting \ninstructions, the solicitation stated that \u201c[vendors] that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the quot[ation] will be considered non-responsive or deficient and will be considered ineligible for award.\u201d  Id.    \n Furthermore, as noted above, t he RFQ included several other sections, emphasizing \nthat failure to follow the detailed solicitation instructions would be considered a \ndeficiency ,\u201d which mandated elimination from the competition. See RFQ at 47, 63.  \nGiven this language, the agency\u2019s decision to eliminate RiverNorth\u2019s quotation for its failure, however minor, to follow the quotation formatting instructions, was in accordance with the solicitation terms.  While the protester argues that  quotations would \nbe defi cient, and eliminated, under the terms of the RFQ only if they had multiple errors, \nwe do not agree with RiverNorth\u2019s contention that the solicitation required \u201cmultiple errors\u201d to be eliminated from the competition.  The solicitation instead referred to the \nrequirement that vendors follow all solicitation instructions, and that any error attributed to a vendor\u2019s failure to follow solicitation instructions would result in its elimination from the competition.  Stated otherwise, the plural form of errors in the RFQ instructions, \u201c [i]f \na [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation]  has errors attributed to not following the directions contained \nherein, the [Vendor] \u2019s quot [ation shall be ineligible for award,\u201d refers to either single or \nmultiple errors.  See  RFQ at 47.     \n The protester also contends that the solicitation contained a latent ambiguity because it was unclear what constituted a \u201cdeficiency\u201d that warranted rejection of a quotation.  Protest at 15.  RiverNorth argues that \u201cthe RFQ stated a deficiency could lead to quot[ation]  rejection.  However, it  doesn\u2019t directly define such term until multiple pages \nlater, indicating these two RFQ terms aren\u2019t  even related. \u201d  Id.   \n In response, the agency contends that the solicitation was clear and unambiguous.  The agency maintains that RiverNorth\u2019s argument regarding the definition of a deficiency \u201cmakes no sense, as throughout the RFQ the definition of deficiency, and its location relative to its use in the RFQ, is referenced consistently.\u201d  MOL at 7.  \n Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation \nmust be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.  Bastion Techs., Inc. , B-418432, May 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 163 at 5.  An \nambiguity exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the terms or specifica tions of the solicitation are possible.  The HP Grp., LLC , B-415285, Dec. 14, \n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 385 at 5.  A patent ambiguity exists where the solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error, while a latent ambiguity is more subtle.  Id.   Where  Page 7 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  there is a latent ambiguity, both parties\u2019 interpretations of the provision may be \nreasonable, and the appropriate course of action is to clarify the requirement and afford offerors an opportunity to submit proposals based on the clarified requirement.  Qwest Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc . d\/b\/a CenturyLink QGS , B-419597, B -419597.2, May 24, 2021, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 217 at 5 n.7.  \n Based on our review of the record, the solicitation does not contain a latent ambiguity  as \nalleged by RiverNorth.   The protester\u2019s interpretation ignores the clear and unequivocal \nsolicitation language that explained the required font size and type requirements.   See \nRFQ at 51.   As explained above, the RFQ informed vendors that \u201ca failure to provide the \ninformation in the format with the content as prescribed will be considered a deficiency.\u201d  RFQ at 64.  The fact that the definition of deficiency was found multiple pages after the \nsolicitation first notified vendors that a deficiency would lead to elimination of a quotation does not create any ambiguity.  Moreover, as the agency points out, RiverNorth\u2019s argument ignores the multiple different places where t he solicitation stated that failure to \nfollow quotation formatting instructions would be considered a deficiency.  Consequently, the solicitation was not latently ambiguous as alleged by the protester \nand t his protest allegation is denied.  \n Unequal Treatment  \n RiverNorth alleges that the USDA treated vendors unequally by engaging in discussions with only one vendor.  Supp. Protest at 2.  In this regard, the protester contends that one of the vendors was permitted to provide explanations for why it should not have been eliminated and eventually the agency allowed that vendor back in the competition.  \nId. at 4.  RiverNorth asserts that the eliminated vendor provided:  \u201cA detailed \nwalkthrough of a quot[ation] that no other [vendor] was given the opportunity to provide.  It is essentially a presentation and argument \u2013 a sales pitch essentially \u2013  of the RFQ \ncompliance of the quot[ation], in written form.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 4.  Furthermore, RiverNorth contends that it should have been provided the \u201csame opportunity to revise \nits quot[ation] through discussions\u201d to resolve \u201cany lingering concerns from the USDA, \nincluding any footer text size issues found in its quot[ation].\u201d  Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  \n As explained above, after an initial compliance review, the agency sent unsuccessful notices to vendors whose quotations were determined deficient and removed from further consideration for the BPA.  As  relevant to this protest ground, the agency \neliminated another vendor for including a chart in its quotation \u201cas an image with text.\u201d  AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.  The unsuccessful notices to vendors, including to RiverNorth, did not request or otherwise invite a response.  However, the other vendor sent a letter to the agency arguing that its quotation was \ncompliant with the solicitation and that the agency\u2019s decision for elimination of its quotation was erroneous.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal Letter at 1.  In this regard, the vendor explained that the chart at issue was not a prohibited picture with text, but instead a chart that was \u201cfully editable in [Microsoft] Word as text\u201d which was compliant with solicitation instructions.  Id. at 5; s ee RFQ at 51.  The vendor asked that the agency \nreconsider its decision to eliminate the vendor\u2019s quotation.  AR, Exh. 13.1, Rebuttal  Page 8 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Letter at 1.  Following receipt and review of this vendor\u2019s rebuttal letter, the agency \nconcluded that the table was editable and permitted the vendor back in the competition.  AR, Exh. 13.2, Agency Response to Vendor Rebuttal Letter; AR, Exh. 3, Determination of Compliance Review at 5.   \n The protester asserts that above- described communications constituted discussions \nbecause the eliminated vendor\u2019s \u201cexplanations, arguments, and sales -pitch of \ncompliance and [the] RFQ terms to the USDA caused the [agency] to take separate actions to test i tems and further evaluate the quot[ation] for acceptability.\u201d  Supp. \nComments at 4.  In support of its argument, RiverNorth relies on our decision Spry \nMethods, Inc ., where our Office found that \u201cdiscussions occur when an agency \ncommunicates with a vendor for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determine the acceptability of a quotation,  or provides  the vendor with an opportunity to \nrevise or modify its quotation in some material respect.\u201d   Id. at 3 (quoting Spry Methods, \nInc.-Costs, B-417800.3, Feb.  14, 2020, 2020  CPD \u00b6 83  at 6).  RiverNorth maintains that \nthis constitutes unequal treatment because it was not provided with an opportunity to respond to the unsuccessful notice.       \n     \nIn response, USDA contends that it did not engage in discussions with the re- admitted \nvendor because it did not permit the vendor to revise its quotation.  Supp. MOL at 1- 2.  \nThe agency explains that \u201cthe agency\u2019s evaluation team determined that the error that \nwas originally assigned to the re- admitted [vendor]\u2019s quot[ation] was incorrectly \nassigned, as the chart include[d] in the re- admitted [vendor]\u2019s quot[ation] was in fact not \na prohibited picture with text.\u201d  Id.  at 2.  Instead, the agency contends that it \u201cupheld its \nresponsibility to treat all [vendors] fairly under the RFQ instructions \u201d when it decided to \nre-admit the vendor.  Id.      \n There is no requirement in FAR subpart 8.4 that an agency seek clarifications or otherwise conduct discussions with vendors.  Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc.,  B-421979.4, \nMay 7, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 114 at 5 n.4; Aurotech, Inc. , B-413861.4, June  23, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6 205 at 10.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance i n making \nthis determination.  Id .  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as \u201climited \nexchanges\u201d that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this case quotations) or to resolve minor or clerical mistakes.  See FAR \n15.306(a)(1), (2); Diversified Collection Servs., Inc. , B-406958.3, B -406958.4, Jan. 8, \n2013, 2013 CPD \u00b6 23 at 11 (using FAR part 15 definitions of post -proposal \ncommunications, or exchanges, as guidance in FSS context).   Discussions allow an \nagency  to communicate with offerors  to obtain information essential for determining the \nacceptability of proposals , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify their \nproposals .  See FAR 15.306(d); JHC Technology, Inc ., B-417786, Oct. 23, 2019, 2019 \nCPD \u00b6 376 at 4 -5; Pontiac Flying LLC , B-414433 et al.,  June 12, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 188 \nat 6-7.   \n  Page 9 B-423274.2; B -423274.3  Based on our review of the record, we disagree with RiverNorth\u2019s  interpretation that \ndiscussions occurred here.  As provided above, discussions allow an agency  to \ncommunicate with vendors to obtain information essential for determining the \nacceptability of  quotations , or to provide offerors an opportunity to revise or modify  its \nquotations .  See FAR \u00a7 15.306(d); see also JHC Technology, Inc ., supra at 4-5.  Here, \nthe re- admitted vendor did not change its quotation, rather, it notified the USDA of an \nerror with its evaluation and requested relief.3  In comparison, RiverNorth\u2019s quotation \nwould have required a change, a correction to font size errors, to be considered \ncompliant with the solicitation requirements.    Moreover, we find RiverNorth\u2019s reliance on the Spry Methods  decision misplaced.  This \ncase is distinguishable as the agency  in Spry Methods  initiated communications with the \nvendor, whereas here, the agency did not request any response from the vendors, but rather the other vendor  independently  contact ed USDA.   See Spry Methods, Inc. -Costs, \nsupra at 6-8.  Furthermore, RiverNorth\u2019s argument that the re- admitted vendor\u2019s \nexplanation of why its quotation complied with the solicitation constituted discussions ignores the \u201cacid test\u201d explained in Spry Methods to  determine whether discussions \nhave occurred --e.g. , \u201cwhether a vendor has been afforded an opportunity to revise or \nmodify its quotation.\u201d  Id.  at 6.  Here, the eliminated vendor did not revise or modify its \nquotation in response to the unsuccessful notice.  On this record, RiverNorth has failed to establish that the agency engaged in unequal discussions or treatment; as a result, this protest al legation is denied.   \n SBA Referral   \nFinally, RiverNorth asserts that the agency could not eliminate its quotation without first \nreferring its eligibility for award to the  SBA for a COC determination.  Protest at 19 -20.  \nThe protester alleges that USDA eliminated its quotation based on a \u201cpass\/fail\u201d basis that was aimed at capability and responsibility and therefore it is analogous to a \nresponsibility determination that required the agency to refer the protester to the SBA for a COC.

Protest challenging agency\u2019s conclusion that protester did not demonstrate sufficient capacity at its privately -operated dry dock  to qualify for an award preference is denied \nwhere the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  \n 2.  Protest alleging that agency evaluated offerors\u2019 manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally is denied where the protester\u2019s assertions are not supported by the record.  \nDECISION  \n BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the award of a contract to Continental Maritime of San Diego, LLC (CMSD), of San Diego, California, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N00024- 24-R- 4429, issued by the \nDepartment of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, for ship repair and alteration \nservices for the USS Russell.  BAE alleges that the agency\u2019s evaluation of offerors\u2019 \nproposals and subsequent source selection decision were improper.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the RFP on May 30, 2024, under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15, seeking proposals to provide ship maintenance, repair, and modernization DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423271  services--referred to as a \u201cdocking selected restricted availability \u201d (DSRA) or, more \ngenerally, as an \u201cavailability\u201d --for the naval vessel USS Russell under the Chief of Naval \nOperations (CNO).  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law \n(COS\/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at  1, 175.1  The solicitation required \nthe successful contractor to furnish the material, support, and facilities --as well as to \nprovide the management, technical, procurement, production, testing, and quality assurance services --necessary to prepare and accomplish r epairs and alterations for \nthe USS Russell in accordance with the solicitation.  RFP at  4, 70.  The solicitation \ncontemplated the award of a fixed- price contract with a 14- month period of \nperformance.  COS\/MOL at  2; RFP at  116-120.   \n Basis for Award and General Evaluation Criteria  The solicitation advised that award would be made to the responsible offeror whose \nproposal conformed to the solicitation requirements and represented the best value to \nthe government in a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1)  technical \neligibility and physical resource capacity; (2)  manpower and small business \nparticipation; (3)  schedule and execution approach; (4) past performance; and (5)  price.  \nRFP at  196.  The manpower and small business factor was comprised of two \nsubfactors:  (a)  manpower; and (b)  small business participation.  Id.      \n \nThe RFP provided that the agency would first evaluate proposals under the technical \neligibility and physical resource capacity factor and the past performance factor as \neither acceptable or unacceptable.  Id. at 197.  If a proposal was found to be \nunacceptable under either factor, the agency reserved the right to not further evaluate \nthat proposal.  Id.   For the evaluation under the remaining non- price factors and \nsubfactors, the agency would use the adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, \nacceptable, marginal, and unacceptable.  Id.  at 197, 204- 205.  For the purpose of a \ntradeoff, the manpower and small business participation factor and the schedule and execution approach factor were equal in importance.  Id. at 197.  Under the manpower \nand small business participation factor, the manpower subfactor was more important \nthan the small business participation subfactor.  Id.  The non- price factors, when \ncombined, were considered significantly more important than price.  Id.  \n \nLimitation on Government -Operated Dry Docks  \n \nAs relevant here, the solicitation permitted each offeror to submit two different types of \nproposals --where proposal volume A would be for performance at an offeror\u2019s private \nfacility and proposal volume B would be for performance at the government -provided \ndock at the Naval Base San Diego--\u201c[i]n support of maintaining compliance with \nSection  126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.\u201d  RFP \n \n1 The solicitation was amended eight times.

Page 3 B-423271  at 197.  Section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, in \nrelevant part, provides as follows:  \n \nSEC. 126.  Limitation on Consideration of Government -Operated Dry \nDocks in Certain Contract Solicitations.  \n \n(a)  In General .\u2014 With respect to a solicitation of the Secretary of the \nNavy for the award of a contract for private sector non- nuclear surface \nship maintenance in San Diego, California, the Secretary shall ensure, in accordance with section 2466 of title 10, United States  Code, that \nGovernment -operated dry docks are only included in such solicitation if \nthere is insufficient capacity at privately -operated dry docks for \nperformance of such contract.  \n Pub. L. No. 118- 31, \u00a7 126, 137 Stat. 136, 170 -171 (2023).  Offerors were permitted to \nsubmit just a volume A proposal, just a volume B proposal, or both proposal volumes A and B.  RFP at  177.  The solicitation provided that proposal volumes  A and B \u201cshall be \nevaluated at the same time,\u201d and further specified as f ollows:  \n \nAll Volume A proposals shall be considered for award before all Volume B proposals.  Volume A proposals must be found at least acceptable under \nall Non -Price Factors and include fair and reasonable pricing in the \ncontext of all submitted proposals.  If no Volume A proposal results in a \nselection, all Volume B proposals will be considered for award in accordance with [the RFP\u2019s] Section M criteria. \n Id. at 197.   \n Offerors submitting volume A proposals were required to provide specific information \nunder the technical eligibility and physical resource capacity factor to demonstrate their ability to provide sufficient capacity to perform the requirement at a privately -operated \ndry dock.  Id. at 183-184.  The required information included:  (1)  a completed eligibility \ncriteria data sheet (RFP attach. S -5); (2) a completed execution milestones and key \nevent dates attachment (RFP attach.  J-3) with a signed letter \u201cidentif ying and confirming \nownership\u201d of the proposed pier and dry dock for the proposed milestone dates; (3) a current dry dock certification for the proposed dry dock; (4)  a completed pier and \ndry dock graphical representation (RFP attach. S -8); and (5)  a narra tive in support of \nthe graphical representation.  Id. \n In the eligibility criteria data sheet, offerors were required to \u201cidentif[y] the specific pier and drydock at the contractor facility intended to be used for the proposed availability and indicate[] that the pier and drydock meet the minimum characteristi cs.\u201d  Id. at 183.  \nThe signed letter was to \u201cidentify[] and confirm[] ownership of . . .  a drydock capable of \ndocking the vessel\u201d  for the performance period specified in the execution milestone and \nkey event dates attachment.  Id .  In the pier and dry dock  graphical representation \nattachment, offerors were required to \u201cdemonstrate the Offeror has the pier and dry  Page 4 B-423271  dock capable for completing the requirement s of the proposed availability,\u201d and to show \nthe \u201cpiers and dry docks expected to be in working capacity ,\u201d including the \u201cawarded \nand outstanding projects and work [that are] using those resources.\u201d  Id. at 183-184.  \nThe narrative in support of the pier and dry dock graphical representation was to include \nplans to resolve any pier and dry dock resource conflicts arising from proposed and \nawarded projects.  Id.  at 184.  The RFP advised that \u201c[p]iers and dry docks mu st not be \ncommitted to multiple ships during the same time period without explanation.\u201d  Id. \n For volume A  proposals,  evaluations under the technical eligibility and physical resource \ncapacity factor would assess whether the offeror \u201chas ownership or committed access to . . . a dry dock (Volume A) capable of docking the vessel . . . as outlined in the [offeror\u2019s] Execution Milestones & Key Events (Attachment J -3),\u201d and whether the \nproposed dry dock had the required certification.  Id.  at 199.  The solicitation also \nprovided that the agency would assess \u201cwhether the proposal demonstrates the Offeror\u2019s capability to provide the required physical resources to complete the \navailability\u201d with an \u201cemphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated \nphysical resource conflicts.\u201d  Id.   To that end, the RFP stated that the agency would \nassess whether the offeror\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical representation showed the offeror\u2019s awarded and outstanding projects using those physical resources to assess \u201c[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the solicited availability\u2019s docking resources.\u201d  Id.   \n Manpower Evaluation Scheme  \n As relevant here, under the manpower subfactor of the manpower and small business \nparticipation factor, the solicitation sought \u201cspecified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.\u201d  Id.  at 184.  \nOfferors were to provide this information by completing a manpower performance data sheet, provided as solicitation attachment S -4, as well as submitting detailed manpower \ncharts and manpower narratives.  Id. at 184-186.  The manpower data sheets required \ndetaile d monthly data on \u201call projects,\u201d defined as follows:  \n \nNavy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which \nthe Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy \nproject) which were active (on- going or compl eted) or planned (awarded \nor proposed) (including the proposal for this solicitation) during the first \nmonth identified in Attachment S -4A & S- 4B and the Contract Complete \nDate of this solicitation .   \n \nId. at 184.  Offerors were advised that their manpower data sheets \u201cmust capture all \nwork performed by the Offeror within the shipyard and at the local Naval  \nStation, if the Offeror\u2019s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.\u201d  Id.  \nManpower charts, required in the form of stacked area graphs, were to show the total current and forecasted full -time equivalent (FTE) resources for all projects identified in \nthe data sheet.  Id. at 185.  In addition, the RFP instructed offerors to submit manpower  Page 5 B-423271  narratives \u201cdescribing and quantifying\u201d the information in the manpower data sheet and \nmanpower charts and to explain the offeror\u2019s plans to \u201cadjust or maintain the current workforce to achieve the proposed forecasted FTE levels.\u201d  Id.  \n The solicitation advised that offerors\u2019 manpower proposals would be evaluated to \u201cassess the quality and risk of the Offeror\u2019s plan to provide efficient manpower to successfully complete the availability\u2019s requirements with a focus on workload assessment, labor composition and the associated narrative.\u201d  Id.  at 199.  For this \nassessment, the agency would use the offeror\u2019s data to calculate its current and projected FTEs for the \u201cMinimum Workload Forecast and [the] Maximum Workload \nForecast.\u201d  Id . at 200.  A  current  FTE count  that is more than 50 FTEs below  the \nforecasted FTE count would be assessed as a weakness \u201cunless the narrative \ndemonstrated that the FTE s is not a risk under the circumstances proposed,\u201d while a \nshortfall greater than or equal to 200 FTEs would be assessed as appreciably \nincreasing risk.  Id.  The solicitation further provided that the assessment would \nexamine the \u201creasonableness and effectiveness of the Offeror\u2019s approach,\u201d with a specific focus on \u201c[e]xplanations and mitigations of weak nesses \u201d in the offeror\u2019s \u201c FTE \nand Labor Composition.\u201d  Id. at 201. \n Evaluation and Award  \n The agency received four timely submitted proposals.  COS\/MOL at  4.  BAE submitted \nboth a volume A proposal and a volume B proposal; CMSD and another offeror submitted just volume B proposals.  After evaluation, the agency assigned the following ratings to the proposals submitted by BAE and CMSD:  \n \n \nAR, Tab  6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at  3. \n With respect to considerations under section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, the source selection authority (SSA) noted that, because \u201cBAE was the only Offeror that proposed a private sector dock, and the proposed dock i s \nconsidered \u2018utilized\u2019 . . ., preference was not given to filling unused private sector dock capacity.\u201d  AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at  1.  In this \nregard, the agency found that BAE\u2019s proposal of the Pride of California (POCA) dry  BAE - A BAE - B CMSD - B \nTechnical Eligibility & Physical  \n   Resource Capacity  Acceptable  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nManpower & Small Business  \n   Participation  Acceptable  Acceptable  Good  \n   Manpower  Acceptable  Acceptable  Good  \n   Small Business Participation  Good  Good  Good  \nSchedule & Execution Approach  Acceptable  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nPast Performance  Acceptable  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nPrice  $80,292,705  $73,398,800  $78,384,330   Page 6 B-423271  dock , while t echnically acceptable, proposed a \u201c docking scenario [that] has the USS \nRUSSELL tandem docked with the USS GREEN BAY (LPD 20), another outstanding \nproject. \u201d  AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board ( SSEB)  Report at  6.  The \nSSEB identified the tandem docking scenario as a \u201cpotential physical resource conflict \nin the event USS GREEN BAY is awarded to BAE\u201d and that BAE\u2019s narrative \u201c did not \nprovide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources issue \nother than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking [guided- missile \ndestroyer ( DDG )] and [littoral combat ship ( LCS)] class ships.\u201d  Id.   In this regard, noting \nthat the USS Green Bay was a landing platform dock  (LPD) class ship while the USS \nRussell was a DDG class ship, the SSAB concluded that BAE\u2019s POCA dock could not accommodate the combined lengths and widths of the two ships.  AR, Tab  6, SSAC \nReport at  4.  Based on this conclusion, the SSAC found that the \u201ctechnical risk is \nincreased without further analysis of how BAE would conduct a docking of both USS GREEN BAY and USS RUSSELL at the same time.\u201d   Id.  The SSAC concluded that \nBAE\u2019s volume A proposal \u201cdid not warrant preferential consideration\u201d because BAE \u2019s \n\u201cproposed a private sector dock that will be encumbered with USS GREEN BAY\u201d  and \nthus did not offer sufficient capacity at a privately -operated dry dock for the performance \nof the USS Russell requirement.\n 2  Id. at 5-6.   \n After reviewing the underlying evaluation and consulting with the SSAC, the SSA concluded that CMSD\u2019s volume B proposal represented the best value to the \ngovernment.  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  1, 3.  Specifically, in comparing the volume B \nproposals of BAE and CM SD, the SSA noted that BAE\u2019s proposal received one strength \nand one significant weakness under the manpower subfactor, while CMSD\u2019s proposal was assessed two strengths and no weaknesses.  Id. at 2.  The significant weakness \nwas \u201cdue to [BAE\u2019s] projected av ailable FTEs not exceeding their current onboard \naverage labor resulting in a shortfall of [DELETED]  FTE[s] for the maximum workload \nscenario.\u201d  Id.  Noting that CMSD has the highest rated non- price proposal, the SSA \nconcluded that a price premium of 7 percent was \u201cworth the benefit to the Government \nto ensure sufficient manpower is available to support the successful execution of the work.\u201d  Id. \n Based on this conclusion, the agency awarded the contract to CMSD and notified BAE of the award decision on November 29.  COS\/MOL at  6.  After receiving a debriefing, \nBAE filed this protest.  \n DISCUSSION  \n BAE first challenges the agency\u2019s decision to consider volume B proposals, alleging that the agency erroneously rejected BAE\u2019s volume A proposal based on an unreasonable assessment of BAE\u2019s proposed dry dock capacity.  Protest at  19-27.  BAE also argues  \nthat the agency evaluated proposals unreasonably and disparately under the manpower \n \n2 The agency notes that BAE was notified on August  14 (before proposals for the USS \nRussell were due on September  16) that it was the sole offeror for the USS Green Bay \ncontract, which was to be performed at BAE\u2019s POCA dock.

Protest at  19-27; Comments at  12-20.  \nIn this regard, the protester argues that the agency unreasonably assessed the \navailable capacity at BAE\u2019s proposed private dry dock by misinterpreting BAE\u2019s \nproposal as off ering \u201ctandem docking.\u201d  Id.   The protester also contends that the agency \nimproperly ignored BAE\u2019s proposed \u201cdeconflict strategy\u201d of using another BAE -owned \nprivate dry dock, Pride of San Diego (POSD).  Id.  The agency responds that it \nevaluated BAE\u2019s volume A proposal in accordance with the solicitation and reasonably \ndetermined that BAE\u2019s proposed dry dock was encumbered by another project and \ntherefore was not available for performance of the instant requirement.

Moreover, the solicitation stated that the \nagency would review the offeror\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical representation attachment specifically to assess \u201c[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the \nsolicited availability\u2019s docking resources.\u201d  Id. at 199.    \n While the protester repeatedly asserts that it did not propose the tandem docking of the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay, see Protest at  24 n.5, Comments at  13-19, its \nproposal is not clear in this regard.  Rather, BAE\u2019s proposal included information that reasonably led the agency to conclude that BAE was proposing to dock both ships at POCA during the same period.  Specifically,  BAE\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical \nrepresentation clearly showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay positioned at the PO CA dock for the same period without any explanation except to note generally \nthat \u201c[f]inal pier assignments will be determined at the time of contract award, due to execution of bidder\u2019s firm work and other proposed awards.\u201d  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, \nTechnic al Proposal at  9.  Moreover, in its 10 -page volume A technical proposal, BAE \nmore than once touted its POCA dock\u2019s tandem docking capabilities --specifically, its \nability to accommodate a DD G class ship and a LCS class ship at the same time--to  \n\u201cmaximize dr ydocking capacity of the homeport.\u201d  Id. at 3, 10.   \n Without any additional explanation in BAE\u2019s proposal for its graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay docked at POCA during the \nsame period, we see no basis to fault the agency\u2019s conclusion that BAE was proposing tandem docking of the two ships.  Moreover, the agency informed BAE that it was the only offeror for the USS Green Bay contract more than a month before the due date for proposal submissions here.  On this record, we find that it was incumbent upon BAE to \nprovide an adequate explanation to resolve the apparent conflict caused by both ships \nbeing proposed at POCA for the same period.  The burden of submitting an adequately written proposal falls on the offeror, and the offeror runs the risk that its proposal will be evaluated unfavorably when it fails to meet this burden.

In this regard, the protester asserts that its proposal met solicitation requirements by confirming the availability of another BAE -owned dry dock capable of performing the \nrequirement and by promising to make final dock assignments at contract award to meet \u201call other contract schedule and facility requirements\/ provisions.\u201d  See Protest \nat 22-26; Comments at  13-19.  The protester argues that it thereby proposed \u201cto \nperform the USS RUSSELL availability in the POSD drydock if the POCA drydock was encumbered.\u201d  Comments at  14.  The record, however, does not support the protester\u2019s \nassertions in this regard.   \n  Page 9 B-423271  Instead, the record shows that BAE\u2019s volume A proposal unequivocally proposed the \nPOCA dry dock --and only the POCA dry dock --for the solicited work.  See COS\/MOL \nat 11-13; AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical Proposal at  3 (\u201cBAE Systems will be utilizing \nthe Pride of California (POCA) Drydock and Pier  [DELETED] .\u201d); 8 (\u201cThe RUSSELL \nDSRA docking period will be performed in BAE Systems\u2019 Pride of California (POCA) drydock.\u201d).  In this regard, all of the information BAE included in its proposal to demonstrate the technical merit of its proposed private dry dock identified only POCA by name (to the extent any dock was identified by name) as the dry dock being proposed for the solicited work.  Indeed, BAE\u2019s eligibility criteria data sheet, execution milestone and key event dates attachment, dry dock certification, and pier and dry dock graphical representation all identified POCA as the proposed dry dock.  See id.  at 4, 6, 8, 9.   \n Moreover, BAE\u2019s proposal never expressly proposed the POSD dry dock as a means to resolve a potential schedule conflict at the POCA dry dock.  In this regard, the record shows that BAE\u2019s volume A technical narrative included several general statements about BAE\u2019s ownership of two certified dry docks and its plan to make \u201c[f]inal private dock and pier assignments  . . . at the time of contract award, due to execution of \nbidder\u2019s firm work and other proposal awards.\u201d  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical \nProposal at 3, 9, 10.  BAE\u2019s proposal, however, does not specifically propose POSD as \na dry dock with capacity to perform the solicited requirements, as an alternative or otherwise.  See generally, id.   \n As a matter of fact, the term \u201cPOSD\u201d or \u201cPride of San Diego\u201d appears only once in BAE\u2019s volume A technical proposal:  as a graphical entry in BAE\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical representation.  Id.  at 9.  In that representation, however, POSD is shown as \noccupied by proposed work on another ship, the USS [DELETED] , during the period of \nperformance for the USS Russell.  Id.  As noted above, that same graphical \nrepresentation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay occupying the POCA dry dock during that same period.  Id.  at 9.  In sum, for the applicable period, \nBAE\u2019s graphical representation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock and the USS [DELETED] at the POSD dock.  Id.   Moreover, just as \nno specific explanation was offered for the graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock, no additional explanation was provided with respect to the graphical representation showing that P OSD was occupied \nby work on another  outstanding proposal.  In this regard, the \u201cResource Conflicts\u201d \nportion of BAE\u2019s proposal simply acknowledged that BAE \u201ccurrently has outstanding proposals,\u201d including for work on the USS Green Bay and the USS [DELETED] , but did \nnot mention POSD or any other specific de- conflicting plan, other than a general \npromise to \u201ctake[] reasonable and responsible steps to ensure the resources will be available to perform awarded work.\u201d  Id. at 10.   \n On this record, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that BAE\u2019s proposal \u201cdid not provide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources \nissue other than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking DDG and LCS class  ships.\u201d  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  6.  As noted, the solicitation advised that \n\u201c[p]iers and dry docks must not be committed to multiple ships during the same time  Page 10 B-423271  period without explanation\u201d and that the agency would assess the offeror\u2019s \u201ccapability to \nprovide the required physical resources\u201d with an \u201cemphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated physical resource conflicts.\u201d  RFP at  184, 199.  Here, \nBAE\u2019s proposal provided no specific explanation or plan to address the potential conflict arising from the apparent commitment of multiple ships at the POCA dry dock.  Accordingly, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the POCA dock was unavailable.  Moreover, because BAE never expressly proposed the POSD dock to \nresolve conflicts at the POCA dock, other than a graphical representation showing the POSD dock occupied by another outstanding project, we find that the agency reasonably did not  consider the POSD dock as BAE\u2019s proposed deconflicting strategy.  \n We therefore find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s conclusion that BAE\u2019s proposed private dry dock was \u201cutilized\u201d and did not offer sufficient capacity to perform the requirement for the USS Russell.  See AR, Tab  7, SSDD at  1.  Based on this \nconclusion, the agency reasonably decided to proceed with the consideration of volume B proposals to perform at a government dock without giving preferential \ntreatment to BAE\u2019s volume A proposal.    Evaluation of Volume B Proposals  \n BAE also contends that, even if the agency was justified in considering volume B proposals for award, the agency unreasonably and unequally evaluated those proposals under the manpower subfactor (of the manpower and small business participation factor).  S pecifically, the protester alleges that the agency unreasonably ignored \ninformation in BAE\u2019s proposal in assessing a significant weakness for a significant \nshortfall in the firm\u2019s manpower forecast.  Protest at  33-48; Comments at  21-41.  The \nprotester also argues that the agency erroneously failed to consider a manpower \nshortfall arising from CMSD\u2019s subcontract work on aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at 48-53; Comments at  41-49.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to \nobject to the agenc y\u2019s evaluation.  \n  Evaluation of BAE\u2019s Manpower Proposal  \n The protester challenges the Navy\u2019s assessment of a significant weakness in BAE\u2019s  \nmanpower proposal, asserting that the agency unreasonably ignored relevant information in BAE\u2019s proposal.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s manpower calculations improperly excluded BAE\u2019s proposed manpower from the firm\u2019s projects in [DELETED] and [DELETED] , resulting in a projected shortfall of \n[DELETED]  FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Protest at  33-48; Comments \nat 21-41.  The protester argues t hat the agency similarly ignored BAE\u2019s proposed use of \naffiliate resources and other mitigating measures that would have alleviated any concerns about a projected manpower shortage.  Id.  The agency responds that its \nevaluation properly excluded information about BAE\u2019s affiliated entities and reasonably assessed a significant weakness for an unmitigated and significant shortfall in BAE\u2019s manpower proposal.  COS\/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6.   \n  Page 11 B-423271  The record shows that, using the data in BAE\u2019s manpower performance data sheet, the \nagency calculated BAE\u2019s projected maximum workload scenario to require at least [DELETED]  FTEs, while also calculating BAE\u2019s available \u201cCurrent Yard- Wide\n4 FTE\u201d as \n[DELETED] FTEs.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  22-23.  Based on these calculations, the \nagency found that BAE\u2019s current yard- wide workforce would result in a manpower \nshortfall of [DELETED] FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Id.  at 23.  \nAssessing a significant weakness for this projected manpower shortfall, the agency concluded that BAE\u2019s \u201cin[ -]progress project performance and current yard[ -]wide FTE \nlevels indicate a high risk of competition for resources that significantly incr eases the \nlikelihood the  offeror will not have the manpower resources to perform as planned.\u201d  Id.    \n The protester argues that the agency\u2019s calculations unreasonably excluded the enterprise workforce data for its affiliate entities identified in BAE\u2019s data sheet as two projects:  \u201cProject 20 representing the ongoing and projected repair work at BAE \nSystem s\u2019 [DELETED] shipyard, and Project  23 representing ongoing and projected \nrepair work at BAE Systems\u2019 [DELETED] facility.\u201d  Comments at 23.  The protester \ncontends that the agency was required to consider this information because the \nsolicitation did not li mit the data sheet information that could be submitted to projects \nlocated at the local shipyard.   \n The agency responds that it properly did not consider data about the protester\u2019s affiliate \nentities in the manpower calculation.  In this regard, the agency contends that the \nsolicitation clearly sought data about \u201call work performed by the Offeror within the \nshipyard and at the local Naval Station.\u201d  COS\/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6; \nsee RFP at  184-185.  The agency also argues that the protester\u2019s affiliate entities, in \n[DELETED] and [DELETED] , were not the \u201cOfferor\u201d for BAE\u2019s proposal, and the \nsolicitation required information about all projects \u201cfor which the Offeror  is the prime or a \nmajor subcontractor\u201d at the \u201c Offeror\u2019s \u201d shipyard.  Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6.   \n \nWhere a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s actual requirements, we will first examine \nthe plain language of the solicitation.  DAI Global, LLC , B-416992, Jan.  17, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 25 at  4.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of \nsolicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole \nand in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore \nvalid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole \nand in a reasonable manner .  Crew Training Int \u2019l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb.  7, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6 53 at  4.  A proposed interpretation of solicitation language would be \n \n4 Although the solicitation does not define the term \u201cYard -Wide,\u201d the agency contends \nthat the term was intended to limit the offeror\u2019s FTE data to those \u201cwithin the [offeror\u2019s] shipyard and at the local Naval Station, if the Offeror\u2019s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.\u201d  Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6.  The protester disputes the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation, arguing that the term could mean within any of the offeror\u2019s shipyards.  Protester\u2019s Supp.  Comments at  18-19.  As further discussed below, we need not \naddress this issue in this decision.   Page 12 B-423271  unreasonable insofar as it would render other solicitation language superfluous.  See \nAnders Constr ., Inc., B-414261, Apr.  11, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 121 at  3-4. \n Here, the protester\u2019s argument that the solicitation did not prohibit manpower data from outside the local San Diego shipyard wholly disregards the detailed solicitation instructions to complete the data sheet and manpower charts with specific, project -based data.  As noted, the solicitation provided a detailed definition of \n\u201cprojects\u201d --as \u201cNavy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which \nthe Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor\u201d --and instructed offerors to provide \nspecific, detailed information about each project in the format provided in solicitation attachment  S-4.  RFP at  184-185.  The solicitation further informed offerors that the \nagency would use this detailed, project -specific  data to calculate the offeror\u2019s projected \nworkload needs and the manpower available for meeting those needs, calculated as the offeror\u2019s historical and current yard- wide FTEs.  Id. at 200.   \n The specific entries that the protester alleges should have been included in the calculations did not satisfy this definition of \u201cprojects\u201d because they:  (1) did not present data for discrete projects; and (2) represented the combined workforce data for t wo of \nthe protester\u2019s affiliate entities, rather than projects \u201cfor which the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor.\u201d\n5  RFP at 184; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, Appendix B, BAE\u2019s \nManpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE\u2019s Manpower and Small \nBusiness Participation Proposal at  6-7.  More specifically, despite being included in the \nmanpower data sheet as \u201cProject  20\u201d and \u201cProject  23,\u201d respectively, the entries for \u201cBAE \nSystems [DELETED] Ship Repair\u201d and \u201cBAE Systems [DELETED] Ship Repair\u201d \nprovided summarized data for BAE\u2019s affiliate entities,  \u201cdepict [ing] recent actual \nperformance and forecasted manhour requirements ,\u201d reflecting the purported resources \nof those affiliate entities  rather than discrete projects.  See AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, \nAppendix B, BAE\u2019s Manpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE\u2019s \nManpower and Small Business Participation Proposal at  10.  Moreover, as the agency \nnotes, the offeror in the protester\u2019s proposal is BAE  Systems San Diego Ship Repair, \nInc., of San Diego, California, not BAE\u2019s affiliate entities in [DELETED] and [DELETED] .  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 5-6.  On this record, we find no basis to conclude that the agency \nunreasonably excluded the data about BAE\u2019s affiliate entities from its evaluation of BAE\u2019s manpower.\n 6    \n \n5 In contrast, the record shows that BAE followed the solicitation instructions when it \nidentified and provided required data for the [DELETED] discrete shipyard projects in its \nmanpower data sheet, e.g.,  the USS Russell as project [DELETED] , the USS Green \nBay as project  [DELETED] , and the USS [DELETED]  as project  [DELETED] .   \n6 Because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not elaborate on why the \nagency excluded the disputed data in its calculations, BAE  contends that the agency \u2019s \npost-protest explanations  offer an impermissible post-hoc interpretation of the \nsolicitation that should be afforded little weight.  In our view,  however,  the agency \u2019s \nresponse provides a credible and consistent rationale for the Navy\u2019s contemporaneous \ndecision to disregard the manpower data for BAE\u2019s affiliate entities .  Wackenhut Servs., \n(continued...)   Page 13 B-423271   \nWe also find no basis to question the SSEB\u2019s conclusion that BAE\u2019s manpower narrative \u201cdid not provide a sufficient explanation for overcoming the manning shortfall calculated by Navy\u2019s Projected Workload via the provided BAE attachment S -4.\u201d  AR, \nTab 4, SSEB Report  at 24.  While the protester argues that the mitigation approaches \ndetailed in its manpower narrative --i.e., its hiring initiative, enterprise resource sharing, \nand subcontracting approach--should have alleviated any concern about BAE\u2019s manpower shortfall, Protest at  40-48, Comments at  29-41, the protester\u2019s arguments in \nthis regard amount to nothing more than disagreement with the agency\u2019s reasonable evaluation.    The record shows that the agency specifically considered each mitigation approach proposed in BAE\u2019s manpower narrative to determine whether the approach sufficiently mitigated the significant weakness of BAE\u2019s projected manpower shortage.  AR, Tab 4, \nSSEB Report  at 24.  For example, the SSEB considered BAE\u2019s \u201cattempt[] to mitigate \nhiring actions by hiring trades starting in March 2024\u201d and found that BAE\u2019s narrative did \u201cnot state the progress with this hiring initiative to the date of their USS RUSSELL proposal r eceipt.\u201d  Id.  The agency further explains that, while BAE\u2019s narrative stated \nthat it \u201cinitiated a hiring plan\u201d by hiring \u201c [DELETED] BAE Systems and temporary labor \npersonnel since 03\/01\/2024\u201d and planned to hire an \u201cadditional [DELETED] trade \npersonnel\u201d by December 2024, it did not explain whether its manpower charts included those [DELETED] additional FTEs or provide any detail about its plan to hire \n[DELETED] more FTEs in just three months (from September 16 to December 2024).  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 6 n.7; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, BAE\u2019s Manpower and Small \nBusiness Participation Proposal at  9.  While the protester now presents additional \ninformation by providing interim recruitment dates and even a new chart purportedly \u201cbased directly on the data provided in the hiring approach discussi on\u201d in BAE\u2019s \nproposal, these additional details were not included in the proposal that the agency evaluated.  Comments at  35; see generally, AR, Tab  2, Vol. 2B, BAE\u2019s Manpower and \nSmall Business Participation Proposal.    Therefore, on this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s reasoned conclusion that BAE\u2019s manpower narrative did not provide sufficient information to overcome the risk presented by the assessed manpower shortage of [DELETED] \nFTEs.\n7  As noted above, the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency\u2019s \n \nInc., B-286037, B -286037.2, Nov. 14, 2000, 2001 CPD \u00b6 114 at 4- 5 (\u201cWhile we \ngenerally accord greater weight to contemporaneous evidence, we will consider post-protest explanations that provide a rationale for contemporaneous conclusions, so \nlong as those explanations are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record. \u201d).  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the agency \u2019s explanation constitutes  \nan impermissible post-hoc rationalization . \n7 Although the protester also argues that various mitigating approaches in its manpower \nnarrative should have at least improved the risk presented from a significant weakness \n(continued...)   Page 14 B-423271  discretion; a  protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without more, is \ninsufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  See Vertex Aerospace, \nLLC, supra.  \n \n Evaluation of CMSD\u2019s Manpower Proposal  \n The protester also contends that the agency evaluated manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally by calculating manpower without considering CMSD\u2019s subcontract work on various aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at  48-53; Comments \nat 41-49.  Specifically, the protester alleges that publicly available information shows \nthat CMSD has undertaken a significant manpower commitment from certain aircraft carrier subcontract work which, if included in the manpower performance calculations, would have resulted in a significant, forecasted shortage in CMSD\u2019s manpower.  Id.    \n For the purpose of the evaluation under the manpower subfactor, the solicitation required offerors to provide \u201cspecified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.\u201d  RFP at  184.  The required workload \ndata was to be provided for all projects \u201cfor which the Offeror is the prime or a major \nsubcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy project).\u201d  Id.  The record shows that the SSEB assigned a rating \nof good to CMSD\u2019s manpower proposal based on two strengths assigned for calculations showing a manpower surplus of over [DELETED] FTEs under both the \nmaximum and the minimum workload scenarios.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report  at 24. \n The protester asserts, based on information it obtained from \u201cpublic sources,\u201d that \nCMSD improperly omitted data about its subcontract work on two aircraft carrier projects from its manpower data sheet and charts.  Protest at  48-53; Comments \nat 41-49; Supp. Comments at  13-16.  BAE contends that the agency unreasonably \nignored this omission during its evaluation of CMSD\u2019s manpower despite references to this work in CMSD\u2019s proposal.  Id.  The protester argues that, had CMSD included these projects in its manpower data sheet and manpower charts, the calculations would show a projected manpower shortage rather than a surplus.  Id. \n The agency responds that it reasonably did not consider the workforce data for CMSD\u2019s aircraft carrier subcontract work when evaluating CMSD\u2019s manpower proposal.  COS\/MOL at 21; Supp. COS\/MOL at  1-2.  In this regard, the agency notes that the \nsolicitation did not require offerors to explain why work was excluded from the \nmanpower data sheet and that the Navy had no reason to question CMSD\u2019s decision on what information was included in its proposal.  Supp. COS\/MOL at  2.  The agency also \nnotes that CMSD\u2019s proposal nevertheless did explain why it did not include the aircraft carrier subcontract work by explaining that it carries additional FTEs to support subcontracted work not required to be reported under this solicitation.  Id., citing AR, \n \nto a weakness, the protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency in this regard also fails to establish that the agency\u2019s judgment was unreasonable.   Page 15 B-423271  Tab 3b, Vol.  2B-7, CMSD\u2019s Manpower Narrative at  3.  Based on our review of the \nrecord, we agree with the agency.  \n \nAs an initial matter, while the solicitation required offerors to provide data about projects for which they were \u201cthe prime or a major subcontractor\u201d (defined as performing 30 percent or more of the work), it did not require offerors to provide any inform ation \nabout subcontractor projects below that threshold.  RFP at  184.  Specifically, the \nprotester appears to suggest that CMSD was required to provide detailed data about its aircraft carrier subcontract work and then allow the agency to confirm that CMSD  was \nperforming less than 30 percent of the work, see Supp. Comments at  16, but the \nsolicitation included no such requirement.  Rather, the solicitation relied on the offeror to provide the required information for projects that met the applicable solicitation definition, and advised that the manpower evaluation would be based on the information provided in the offeror\u2019s proposal.\n8  RFP at  184-186, 199- 201.  To the extent an offeror \ndetermined that a particular work effort did not meet the threshold criteria for projects required to be included in the proposal, nothing in the solicitation required the Navy to investigate beyond the four corners of the proposal  to question that determination.  \n In any event, the record shows that CMSD\u2019s proposal informed the agency that its aircraft carrier subcontract work did not fall within the definition of projects required to be included in the proposal.  In addition to explaining that it \u201c carries additional organic \nFTEs to support other subcontracted work that is  less than the 30 [percent]  of a CNO  \navailability required for reporting [in accordance with]  this solicitation ,\u201d CMSD \nspecifically referred to its aircraft carrier subcontract work as \u201c additional \u201d work that was \nnot required to be \u201creported\u201d  in its manpower proposal.  See AR, Tab  3b, Vol.  2B-7, \nCMSD\u2019s Manpower Narrative at  1 (\u201cIn addition to supporting the [DELETED] \n[availabilities], CMSD is presently supporting the following availability . . .\u201d); 2  (\u201cCMSD\u2019s \nstill has additional  labor force available not accounted for in the scheduled FTEs \ncurrently supporting non- Prime [aircraft carrier] availabilities. . . .

On this record, we \nfind that the agency reasonably did not consider CMSD\u2019s additional aircraft carrier \n \n8 The protester also complains that the agency\u2019s post -protest explanation in this regard \noffers various theories about CMSD\u2019s aircraft carrier subcontract work without any contemporaneous evaluation documentation about this work, and thus constitutes an impermissible post-hoc rationalization.  See Supp. Comments at  1-16.  As our Office \nhas noted, we do not expect an agency \u2019s evaluation report to \u201cprove a negative. \u201d  See \nBillSmart Solutions, LLC, B -413272.4, B -413272.5, Oct.  23, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 325 \nat 14 n.19.   Thus, there was no requirement for the agency  to document why it did not \nconsider information that the solicitation did not require to be included in an offeror\u2019s proposal, and which the awardee did not, in fact, include.   Page 16 B-423271  project manpower data, which fell outside the definition of projects required to be \nincluded in the offerors\u2019 manpower charts and data sheets.9   \n We similarly find that the protester\u2019s allegation that the Navy evaluated manpower disparately is unsupported by this record.  In this regard, the agency did not consider \nthis non- major subcontractor work in its manpower evaluation just as the agency \ndeclined to include BAE\u2019s affiliate manpower data (which, as discussed above, also \ndidn\u2019t satisfy the solicitation requirements) in the calculations.  Accordingly, we find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.\n10 \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n \n9 In any case, the intervenor confirms that the aircraft carrier projects were not included \nin its proposal because CMSD was not a \u201cmajor subcontractor\u201d as defined by the solicitation, performing substantially less than 30 percent of the work for those proj ects.  \nIntervenor\u2019s Supp. Comments at  1-2; Intervenor\u2019s Comments, exh.

Protest alleging that agency evaluated offerors\u2019 manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally is denied where the protester\u2019s assertions are not supported by the record.  \nDECISION  \n BAE Systems San Diego Ship Repair, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the award of a contract to Continental Maritime of San Diego, LLC (CMSD), of San Diego, California, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N00024- 24-R- 4429, issued by the \nDepartment of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, for ship repair and alteration \nservices for the USS Russell.  BAE alleges that the agency\u2019s evaluation of offerors\u2019 \nproposals and subsequent source selection decision were improper.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the RFP on May 30, 2024, under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15, seeking proposals to provide ship maintenance, repair, and modernization DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423271  services--referred to as a \u201cdocking selected restricted availability \u201d (DSRA) or, more \ngenerally, as an \u201cavailability\u201d --for the naval vessel USS Russell under the Chief of Naval \nOperations (CNO).  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law \n(COS\/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at  1, 175.1  The solicitation required \nthe successful contractor to furnish the material, support, and facilities --as well as to \nprovide the management, technical, procurement, production, testing, and quality assurance services --necessary to prepare and accomplish r epairs and alterations for \nthe USS Russell in accordance with the solicitation.  RFP at  4, 70.  The solicitation \ncontemplated the award of a fixed- price contract with a 14- month period of \nperformance.  COS\/MOL at  2; RFP at  116-120.   \n Basis for Award and General Evaluation Criteria  The solicitation advised that award would be made to the responsible offeror whose \nproposal conformed to the solicitation requirements and represented the best value to \nthe government in a tradeoff considering the following five factors:  (1)  technical \neligibility and physical resource capacity; (2)  manpower and small business \nparticipation; (3)  schedule and execution approach; (4) past performance; and (5)  price.  \nRFP at  196.  The manpower and small business factor was comprised of two \nsubfactors:  (a)  manpower; and (b)  small business participation.  Id.      \n \nThe RFP provided that the agency would first evaluate proposals under the technical \neligibility and physical resource capacity factor and the past performance factor as \neither acceptable or unacceptable.  Id. at 197.  If a proposal was found to be \nunacceptable under either factor, the agency reserved the right to not further evaluate \nthat proposal.  Id.   For the evaluation under the remaining non- price factors and \nsubfactors, the agency would use the adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, \nacceptable, marginal, and unacceptable.  Id.  at 197, 204- 205.  For the purpose of a \ntradeoff, the manpower and small business participation factor and the schedule and execution approach factor were equal in importance.  Id. at 197.  Under the manpower \nand small business participation factor, the manpower subfactor was more important \nthan the small business participation subfactor.  Id.  The non- price factors, when \ncombined, were considered significantly more important than price.  Id.  \n \nLimitation on Government -Operated Dry Docks  \n \nAs relevant here, the solicitation permitted each offeror to submit two different types of \nproposals --where proposal volume A would be for performance at an offeror\u2019s private \nfacility and proposal volume B would be for performance at the government -provided \ndock at the Naval Base San Diego--\u201c[i]n support of maintaining compliance with \nSection  126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.\u201d  RFP \n \n1 The solicitation was amended eight times.  COS\/MOL at  2.  References to the \nsolicitation are to the conformed RFP provided by the agency at tab 1 of its report.  \nCitations to the record are to the Adobe PDF page numbers.   Page 3 B-423271  at 197.  Section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, in \nrelevant part, provides as follows:  \n \nSEC. 126.  Limitation on Consideration of Government -Operated Dry \nDocks in Certain Contract Solicitations.  \n \n(a)  In General .\u2014 With respect to a solicitation of the Secretary of the \nNavy for the award of a contract for private sector non- nuclear surface \nship maintenance in San Diego, California, the Secretary shall ensure, in accordance with section 2466 of title 10, United States  Code, that \nGovernment -operated dry docks are only included in such solicitation if \nthere is insufficient capacity at privately -operated dry docks for \nperformance of such contract.  \n Pub. L. No. 118- 31, \u00a7 126, 137 Stat. 136, 170 -171 (2023).  Offerors were permitted to \nsubmit just a volume A proposal, just a volume B proposal, or both proposal volumes A and B.  RFP at  177.  The solicitation provided that proposal volumes  A and B \u201cshall be \nevaluated at the same time,\u201d and further specified as f ollows:  \n \nAll Volume A proposals shall be considered for award before all Volume B proposals.  Volume A proposals must be found at least acceptable under \nall Non -Price Factors and include fair and reasonable pricing in the \ncontext of all submitted proposals.  If no Volume A proposal results in a \nselection, all Volume B proposals will be considered for award in accordance with [the RFP\u2019s] Section M criteria. \n Id. at 197.   \n Offerors submitting volume A proposals were required to provide specific information \nunder the technical eligibility and physical resource capacity factor to demonstrate their ability to provide sufficient capacity to perform the requirement at a privately -operated \ndry dock.  Id. at 183-184.  The required information included:  (1)  a completed eligibility \ncriteria data sheet (RFP attach. S -5); (2) a completed execution milestones and key \nevent dates attachment (RFP attach.  J-3) with a signed letter \u201cidentif ying and confirming \nownership\u201d of the proposed pier and dry dock for the proposed milestone dates; (3) a current dry dock certification for the proposed dry dock; (4)  a completed pier and \ndry dock graphical representation (RFP attach. S -8); and (5)  a narra tive in support of \nthe graphical representation.  Id. \n In the eligibility criteria data sheet, offerors were required to \u201cidentif[y] the specific pier and drydock at the contractor facility intended to be used for the proposed availability and indicate[] that the pier and drydock meet the minimum characteristi cs.\u201d  Id. at 183.  \nThe signed letter was to \u201cidentify[] and confirm[] ownership of . . .  a drydock capable of \ndocking the vessel\u201d  for the performance period specified in the execution milestone and \nkey event dates attachment.  Id .  In the pier and dry dock  graphical representation \nattachment, offerors were required to \u201cdemonstrate the Offeror has the pier and dry  Page 4 B-423271  dock capable for completing the requirement s of the proposed availability,\u201d and to show \nthe \u201cpiers and dry docks expected to be in working capacity ,\u201d including the \u201cawarded \nand outstanding projects and work [that are] using those resources.\u201d  Id. at 183-184.  \nThe narrative in support of the pier and dry dock graphical representation was to include \nplans to resolve any pier and dry dock resource conflicts arising from proposed and \nawarded projects.  Id.  at 184.  The RFP advised that \u201c[p]iers and dry docks mu st not be \ncommitted to multiple ships during the same time period without explanation.\u201d  Id. \n For volume A  proposals,  evaluations under the technical eligibility and physical resource \ncapacity factor would assess whether the offeror \u201chas ownership or committed access to . . . a dry dock (Volume A) capable of docking the vessel . . . as outlined in the [offeror\u2019s] Execution Milestones & Key Events (Attachment J -3),\u201d and whether the \nproposed dry dock had the required certification.  Id.  at 199.  The solicitation also \nprovided that the agency would assess \u201cwhether the proposal demonstrates the Offeror\u2019s capability to provide the required physical resources to complete the \navailability\u201d with an \u201cemphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated \nphysical resource conflicts.\u201d  Id.   To that end, the RFP stated that the agency would \nassess whether the offeror\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical representation showed the offeror\u2019s awarded and outstanding projects using those physical resources to assess \u201c[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the solicited availability\u2019s docking resources.\u201d  Id.   \n Manpower Evaluation Scheme  \n As relevant here, under the manpower subfactor of the manpower and small business \nparticipation factor, the solicitation sought \u201cspecified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.\u201d  Id.  at 184.  \nOfferors were to provide this information by completing a manpower performance data sheet, provided as solicitation attachment S -4, as well as submitting detailed manpower \ncharts and manpower narratives.  Id. at 184-186.  The manpower data sheets required \ndetaile d monthly data on \u201call projects,\u201d defined as follows:  \n \nNavy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which \nthe Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy \nproject) which were active (on- going or compl eted) or planned (awarded \nor proposed) (including the proposal for this solicitation) during the first \nmonth identified in Attachment S -4A & S- 4B and the Contract Complete \nDate of this solicitation .   \n \nId. at 184.  Offerors were advised that their manpower data sheets \u201cmust capture all \nwork performed by the Offeror within the shipyard and at the local Naval  \nStation, if the Offeror\u2019s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.\u201d  Id.  \nManpower charts, required in the form of stacked area graphs, were to show the total current and forecasted full -time equivalent (FTE) resources for all projects identified in \nthe data sheet.  Id. at 185.  In addition, the RFP instructed offerors to submit manpower  Page 5 B-423271  narratives \u201cdescribing and quantifying\u201d the information in the manpower data sheet and \nmanpower charts and to explain the offeror\u2019s plans to \u201cadjust or maintain the current workforce to achieve the proposed forecasted FTE levels.\u201d  Id.  \n The solicitation advised that offerors\u2019 manpower proposals would be evaluated to \u201cassess the quality and risk of the Offeror\u2019s plan to provide efficient manpower to successfully complete the availability\u2019s requirements with a focus on workload assessment, labor composition and the associated narrative.\u201d  Id.  at 199.  For this \nassessment, the agency would use the offeror\u2019s data to calculate its current and projected FTEs for the \u201cMinimum Workload Forecast and [the] Maximum Workload \nForecast.\u201d  Id . at 200.  A  current  FTE count  that is more than 50 FTEs below  the \nforecasted FTE count would be assessed as a weakness \u201cunless the narrative \ndemonstrated that the FTE s is not a risk under the circumstances proposed,\u201d while a \nshortfall greater than or equal to 200 FTEs would be assessed as appreciably \nincreasing risk.  Id.  The solicitation further provided that the assessment would \nexamine the \u201creasonableness and effectiveness of the Offeror\u2019s approach,\u201d with a specific focus on \u201c[e]xplanations and mitigations of weak nesses \u201d in the offeror\u2019s \u201c FTE \nand Labor Composition.\u201d  Id. at 201. \n Evaluation and Award  \n The agency received four timely submitted proposals.  COS\/MOL at  4.  BAE submitted \nboth a volume A proposal and a volume B proposal; CMSD and another offeror submitted just volume B proposals.  After evaluation, the agency assigned the following ratings to the proposals submitted by BAE and CMSD:  \n \n \nAR, Tab  6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at  3. \n With respect to considerations under section 126 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, the source selection authority (SSA) noted that, because \u201cBAE was the only Offeror that proposed a private sector dock, and the proposed dock i s \nconsidered \u2018utilized\u2019 . . ., preference was not given to filling unused private sector dock capacity.\u201d  AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at  1.  In this \nregard, the agency found that BAE\u2019s proposal of the Pride of California (POCA) dry  BAE - A BAE - B CMSD - B \nTechnical Eligibility & Physical  \n   Resource Capacity  Acceptable  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nManpower & Small Business  \n   Participation  Acceptable  Acceptable  Good  \n   Manpower  Acceptable  Acceptable  Good  \n   Small Business Participation  Good  Good  Good  \nSchedule & Execution Approach  Acceptable  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nPast Performance  Acceptable  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nPrice  $80,292,705  $73,398,800  $78,384,330   Page 6 B-423271  dock , while t echnically acceptable, proposed a \u201c docking scenario [that] has the USS \nRUSSELL tandem docked with the USS GREEN BAY (LPD 20), another outstanding \nproject. \u201d  AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board ( SSEB)  Report at  6.  The \nSSEB identified the tandem docking scenario as a \u201cpotential physical resource conflict \nin the event USS GREEN BAY is awarded to BAE\u201d and that BAE\u2019s narrative \u201c did not \nprovide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources issue \nother than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking [guided- missile \ndestroyer ( DDG )] and [littoral combat ship ( LCS)] class ships.\u201d  Id.   In this regard, noting \nthat the USS Green Bay was a landing platform dock  (LPD) class ship while the USS \nRussell was a DDG class ship, the SSAB concluded that BAE\u2019s POCA dock could not accommodate the combined lengths and widths of the two ships.  AR, Tab  6, SSAC \nReport at  4.  Based on this conclusion, the SSAC found that the \u201ctechnical risk is \nincreased without further analysis of how BAE would conduct a docking of both USS GREEN BAY and USS RUSSELL at the same time.\u201d   Id.  The SSAC concluded that \nBAE\u2019s volume A proposal \u201cdid not warrant preferential consideration\u201d because BAE \u2019s \n\u201cproposed a private sector dock that will be encumbered with USS GREEN BAY\u201d  and \nthus did not offer sufficient capacity at a privately -operated dry dock for the performance \nof the USS Russell requirement.\n 2  Id. at 5-6.   \n After reviewing the underlying evaluation and consulting with the SSAC, the SSA concluded that CMSD\u2019s volume B proposal represented the best value to the \ngovernment.  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  1, 3.  Specifically, in comparing the volume B \nproposals of BAE and CM SD, the SSA noted that BAE\u2019s proposal received one strength \nand one significant weakness under the manpower subfactor, while CMSD\u2019s proposal was assessed two strengths and no weaknesses.  Id. at 2.  The significant weakness \nwas \u201cdue to [BAE\u2019s] projected av ailable FTEs not exceeding their current onboard \naverage labor resulting in a shortfall of [DELETED]  FTE[s] for the maximum workload \nscenario.\u201d  Id.  Noting that CMSD has the highest rated non- price proposal, the SSA \nconcluded that a price premium of 7 percent was \u201cworth the benefit to the Government \nto ensure sufficient manpower is available to support the successful execution of the work.\u201d  Id. \n Based on this conclusion, the agency awarded the contract to CMSD and notified BAE of the award decision on November 29.  COS\/MOL at  6.  After receiving a debriefing, \nBAE filed this protest.  \n DISCUSSION  \n BAE first challenges the agency\u2019s decision to consider volume B proposals, alleging that the agency erroneously rejected BAE\u2019s volume A proposal based on an unreasonable assessment of BAE\u2019s proposed dry dock capacity.  Protest at  19-27.  BAE also argues  \nthat the agency evaluated proposals unreasonably and disparately under the manpower \n \n2 The agency notes that BAE was notified on August  14 (before proposals for the USS \nRussell were due on September  16) that it was the sole offeror for the USS Green Bay \ncontract, which was to be performed at BAE\u2019s POCA dock.

As we discuss below, we find no basis to sustain the protest.3 \n \nAs an initial matter, i n reviewing a protest challenging an agency\u2019s evaluation, our Office \nwill not reevaluate proposals, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency, as the \nevaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion.

Protest at  19-27; Comments at  12-20.  \nIn this regard, the protester argues that the agency unreasonably assessed the \navailable capacity at BAE\u2019s proposed private dry dock by misinterpreting BAE\u2019s \nproposal as off ering \u201ctandem docking.\u201d  Id.   The protester also contends that the agency \nimproperly ignored BAE\u2019s proposed \u201cdeconflict strategy\u201d of using another BAE -owned \nprivate dry dock, Pride of San Diego (POSD).  Id.  The agency responds that it \nevaluated BAE\u2019s volume A proposal in accordance with the solicitation and reasonably \ndetermined that BAE\u2019s proposed dry dock was encumbered by another project and \ntherefore was not available for performance of the instant requirement.  COS\/MOL \nat 7-14.  As discussed below, we agree with the agency.  \n It is an offeror\u2019s responsibility to submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed \ninformation which allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.

Moreover, the solicitation stated that the \nagency would review the offeror\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical representation attachment specifically to assess \u201c[s]chedule risks to projects that may impact the \nsolicited availability\u2019s docking resources.\u201d  Id. at 199.    \n While the protester repeatedly asserts that it did not propose the tandem docking of the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay, see Protest at  24 n.5, Comments at  13-19, its \nproposal is not clear in this regard.  Rather, BAE\u2019s proposal included information that reasonably led the agency to conclude that BAE was proposing to dock both ships at POCA during the same period.  Specifically,  BAE\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical \nrepresentation clearly showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay positioned at the PO CA dock for the same period without any explanation except to note generally \nthat \u201c[f]inal pier assignments will be determined at the time of contract award, due to execution of bidder\u2019s firm work and other proposed awards.\u201d  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, \nTechnic al Proposal at  9.  Moreover, in its 10 -page volume A technical proposal, BAE \nmore than once touted its POCA dock\u2019s tandem docking capabilities --specifically, its \nability to accommodate a DD G class ship and a LCS class ship at the same time--to  \n\u201cmaximize dr ydocking capacity of the homeport.\u201d  Id. at 3, 10.   \n Without any additional explanation in BAE\u2019s proposal for its graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay docked at POCA during the \nsame period, we see no basis to fault the agency\u2019s conclusion that BAE was proposing tandem docking of the two ships.  Moreover, the agency informed BAE that it was the only offeror for the USS Green Bay contract more than a month before the due date for proposal submissions here.  On this record, we find that it was incumbent upon BAE to \nprovide an adequate explanation to resolve the apparent conflict caused by both ships \nbeing proposed at POCA for the same period.  The burden of submitting an adequately written proposal falls on the offeror, and the offeror runs the risk that its proposal will be evaluated unfavorably when it fails to meet this burden.  Amentum Servs ., Inc. , VS2, \nLLC, B-418742.3 et al. , Sept.  30, 2021, 2021  CPD \u00b6 334 at 9.  \n Further, we find no support in the record for the protester\u2019s assertion that the agency unreasonably ignored BAE\u2019s proposal of the POSD dry dock as an alternative dry dock.  In this regard, the protester asserts that its proposal met solicitation requirements by confirming the availability of another BAE -owned dry dock capable of performing the \nrequirement and by promising to make final dock assignments at contract award to meet \u201call other contract schedule and facility requirements\/ provisions.\u201d  See Protest \nat 22-26; Comments at  13-19.  The protester argues that it thereby proposed \u201cto \nperform the USS RUSSELL availability in the POSD drydock if the POCA drydock was encumbered.\u201d  Comments at  14.  The record, however, does not support the protester\u2019s \nassertions in this regard.   \n  Page 9 B-423271  Instead, the record shows that BAE\u2019s volume A proposal unequivocally proposed the \nPOCA dry dock --and only the POCA dry dock --for the solicited work.  See COS\/MOL \nat 11-13; AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical Proposal at  3 (\u201cBAE Systems will be utilizing \nthe Pride of California (POCA) Drydock and Pier  [DELETED] .\u201d); 8 (\u201cThe RUSSELL \nDSRA docking period will be performed in BAE Systems\u2019 Pride of California (POCA) drydock.\u201d).  In this regard, all of the information BAE included in its proposal to demonstrate the technical merit of its proposed private dry dock identified only POCA by name (to the extent any dock was identified by name) as the dry dock being proposed for the solicited work.  Indeed, BAE\u2019s eligibility criteria data sheet, execution milestone and key event dates attachment, dry dock certification, and pier and dry dock graphical representation all identified POCA as the proposed dry dock.  See id.  at 4, 6, 8, 9.   \n Moreover, BAE\u2019s proposal never expressly proposed the POSD dry dock as a means to resolve a potential schedule conflict at the POCA dry dock.  In this regard, the record shows that BAE\u2019s volume A technical narrative included several general statements about BAE\u2019s ownership of two certified dry docks and its plan to make \u201c[f]inal private dock and pier assignments  . . . at the time of contract award, due to execution of \nbidder\u2019s firm work and other proposal awards.\u201d  AR, Tab 2, BAE Vol. A, Technical \nProposal at 3, 9, 10.  BAE\u2019s proposal, however, does not specifically propose POSD as \na dry dock with capacity to perform the solicited requirements, as an alternative or otherwise.  See generally, id.   \n As a matter of fact, the term \u201cPOSD\u201d or \u201cPride of San Diego\u201d appears only once in BAE\u2019s volume A technical proposal:  as a graphical entry in BAE\u2019s pier and dry dock graphical representation.  Id.  at 9.  In that representation, however, POSD is shown as \noccupied by proposed work on another ship, the USS [DELETED] , during the period of \nperformance for the USS Russell.  Id.  As noted above, that same graphical \nrepresentation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay occupying the POCA dry dock during that same period.  Id.  at 9.  In sum, for the applicable period, \nBAE\u2019s graphical representation showed both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock and the USS [DELETED] at the POSD dock.  Id.   Moreover, just as \nno specific explanation was offered for the graphical representation showing both the USS Russell and the USS Green Bay at the POCA dock, no additional explanation was provided with respect to the graphical representation showing that P OSD was occupied \nby work on another  outstanding proposal.  In this regard, the \u201cResource Conflicts\u201d \nportion of BAE\u2019s proposal simply acknowledged that BAE \u201ccurrently has outstanding proposals,\u201d including for work on the USS Green Bay and the USS [DELETED] , but did \nnot mention POSD or any other specific de- conflicting plan, other than a general \npromise to \u201ctake[] reasonable and responsible steps to ensure the resources will be available to perform awarded work.\u201d  Id. at 10.   \n On this record, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that BAE\u2019s proposal \u201cdid not provide sufficient information on how they would de- conflict this docking resources \nissue other than to note the [POCA] drydock is capable of tandem docking DDG and LCS class  ships.\u201d  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  6.  As noted, the solicitation advised that \n\u201c[p]iers and dry docks must not be committed to multiple ships during the same time  Page 10 B-423271  period without explanation\u201d and that the agency would assess the offeror\u2019s \u201ccapability to \nprovide the required physical resources\u201d with an \u201cemphasis . . . on how the Offeror plans to de- conflict anticipated physical resource conflicts.\u201d  RFP at  184, 199.  Here, \nBAE\u2019s proposal provided no specific explanation or plan to address the potential conflict arising from the apparent commitment of multiple ships at the POCA dry dock.  Accordingly, we find that the agency reasonably concluded that the POCA dock was unavailable.  Moreover, because BAE never expressly proposed the POSD dock to \nresolve conflicts at the POCA dock, other than a graphical representation showing the POSD dock occupied by another outstanding project, we find that the agency reasonably did not  consider the POSD dock as BAE\u2019s proposed deconflicting strategy.  \n We therefore find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s conclusion that BAE\u2019s proposed private dry dock was \u201cutilized\u201d and did not offer sufficient capacity to perform the requirement for the USS Russell.  See AR, Tab  7, SSDD at  1.  Based on this \nconclusion, the agency reasonably decided to proceed with the consideration of volume B proposals to perform at a government dock without giving preferential \ntreatment to BAE\u2019s volume A proposal.    Evaluation of Volume B Proposals  \n BAE also contends that, even if the agency was justified in considering volume B proposals for award, the agency unreasonably and unequally evaluated those proposals under the manpower subfactor (of the manpower and small business participation factor).  S pecifically, the protester alleges that the agency unreasonably ignored \ninformation in BAE\u2019s proposal in assessing a significant weakness for a significant \nshortfall in the firm\u2019s manpower forecast.  Protest at  33-48; Comments at  21-41.  The \nprotester also argues that the agency erroneously failed to consider a manpower \nshortfall arising from CMSD\u2019s subcontract work on aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at 48-53; Comments at  41-49.  Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to \nobject to the agenc y\u2019s evaluation.  \n  Evaluation of BAE\u2019s Manpower Proposal  \n The protester challenges the Navy\u2019s assessment of a significant weakness in BAE\u2019s  \nmanpower proposal, asserting that the agency unreasonably ignored relevant information in BAE\u2019s proposal.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s manpower calculations improperly excluded BAE\u2019s proposed manpower from the firm\u2019s projects in [DELETED] and [DELETED] , resulting in a projected shortfall of \n[DELETED]  FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Protest at  33-48; Comments \nat 21-41.  The protester argues t hat the agency similarly ignored BAE\u2019s proposed use of \naffiliate resources and other mitigating measures that would have alleviated any concerns about a projected manpower shortage.  Id.  The agency responds that its \nevaluation properly excluded information about BAE\u2019s affiliated entities and reasonably assessed a significant weakness for an unmitigated and significant shortfall in BAE\u2019s manpower proposal.  COS\/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6.   \n  Page 11 B-423271  The record shows that, using the data in BAE\u2019s manpower performance data sheet, the \nagency calculated BAE\u2019s projected maximum workload scenario to require at least [DELETED]  FTEs, while also calculating BAE\u2019s available \u201cCurrent Yard- Wide\n4 FTE\u201d as \n[DELETED] FTEs.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at  22-23.  Based on these calculations, the \nagency found that BAE\u2019s current yard- wide workforce would result in a manpower \nshortfall of [DELETED] FTEs under the maximum workload scenario.  Id.  at 23.  \nAssessing a significant weakness for this projected manpower shortfall, the agency concluded that BAE\u2019s \u201cin[ -]progress project performance and current yard[ -]wide FTE \nlevels indicate a high risk of competition for resources that significantly incr eases the \nlikelihood the  offeror will not have the manpower resources to perform as planned.\u201d  Id.    \n The protester argues that the agency\u2019s calculations unreasonably excluded the enterprise workforce data for its affiliate entities identified in BAE\u2019s data sheet as two projects:  \u201cProject 20 representing the ongoing and projected repair work at BAE \nSystem s\u2019 [DELETED] shipyard, and Project  23 representing ongoing and projected \nrepair work at BAE Systems\u2019 [DELETED] facility.\u201d  Comments at 23.  The protester \ncontends that the agency was required to consider this information because the \nsolicitation did not li mit the data sheet information that could be submitted to projects \nlocated at the local shipyard.   \n The agency responds that it properly did not consider data about the protester\u2019s affiliate \nentities in the manpower calculation.  In this regard, the agency contends that the \nsolicitation clearly sought data about \u201call work performed by the Offeror within the \nshipyard and at the local Naval Station.\u201d  COS\/MOL at  14-20; Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6; \nsee RFP at  184-185.  The agency also argues that the protester\u2019s affiliate entities, in \n[DELETED] and [DELETED] , were not the \u201cOfferor\u201d for BAE\u2019s proposal, and the \nsolicitation required information about all projects \u201cfor which the Offeror  is the prime or a \nmajor subcontractor\u201d at the \u201c Offeror\u2019s \u201d shipyard.  Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6.   \n \nWhere a dispute exists as to a solicitation\u2019s actual requirements, we will first examine \nthe plain language of the solicitation.  DAI Global, LLC , B-416992, Jan.  17, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 25 at  4.  Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of \nsolicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole \nand in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore \nvalid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole \nand in a reasonable manner .  Crew Training Int \u2019l, Inc ., B-414126, Feb.  7, 2017, \n2017 CPD \u00b6 53 at  4.  A proposed interpretation of solicitation language would be \n \n4 Although the solicitation does not define the term \u201cYard -Wide,\u201d the agency contends \nthat the term was intended to limit the offeror\u2019s FTE data to those \u201cwithin the [offeror\u2019s] shipyard and at the local Naval Station, if the Offeror\u2019s shipyard is within the homeport fleet concentration area.\u201d  Supp. COS\/MOL at  5-6.  The protester disputes the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation, arguing that the term could mean within any of the offeror\u2019s shipyards.  Protester\u2019s Supp.  Comments at  18-19.  As further discussed below, we need not \naddress this issue in this decision.   Page 12 B-423271  unreasonable insofar as it would render other solicitation language superfluous.  See \nAnders Constr ., Inc., B-414261, Apr.  11, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 121 at  3-4. \n Here, the protester\u2019s argument that the solicitation did not prohibit manpower data from outside the local San Diego shipyard wholly disregards the detailed solicitation instructions to complete the data sheet and manpower charts with specific, project -based data.  As noted, the solicitation provided a detailed definition of \n\u201cprojects\u201d --as \u201cNavy or Non- Navy Ship Repair and New Construction Projects, for which \nthe Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor\u201d --and instructed offerors to provide \nspecific, detailed information about each project in the format provided in solicitation attachment  S-4.  RFP at  184-185.  The solicitation further informed offerors that the \nagency would use this detailed, project -specific  data to calculate the offeror\u2019s projected \nworkload needs and the manpower available for meeting those needs, calculated as the offeror\u2019s historical and current yard- wide FTEs.  Id. at 200.   \n The specific entries that the protester alleges should have been included in the calculations did not satisfy this definition of \u201cprojects\u201d because they:  (1) did not present data for discrete projects; and (2) represented the combined workforce data for t wo of \nthe protester\u2019s affiliate entities, rather than projects \u201cfor which the Offeror is the prime or a major subcontractor.\u201d\n5  RFP at 184; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, Appendix B, BAE\u2019s \nManpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE\u2019s Manpower and Small \nBusiness Participation Proposal at  6-7.  More specifically, despite being included in the \nmanpower data sheet as \u201cProject  20\u201d and \u201cProject  23,\u201d respectively, the entries for \u201cBAE \nSystems [DELETED] Ship Repair\u201d and \u201cBAE Systems [DELETED] Ship Repair\u201d \nprovided summarized data for BAE\u2019s affiliate entities,  \u201cdepict [ing] recent actual \nperformance and forecasted manhour requirements ,\u201d reflecting the purported resources \nof those affiliate entities  rather than discrete projects.  See AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, \nAppendix B, BAE\u2019s Manpower Performance Data Sheet; AR, Tab 2, Vol. 2B, BAE\u2019s \nManpower and Small Business Participation Proposal at  10.  Moreover, as the agency \nnotes, the offeror in the protester\u2019s proposal is BAE  Systems San Diego Ship Repair, \nInc., of San Diego, California, not BAE\u2019s affiliate entities in [DELETED] and [DELETED] .  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 5-6.  On this record, we find no basis to conclude that the agency \nunreasonably excluded the data about BAE\u2019s affiliate entities from its evaluation of BAE\u2019s manpower.\n 6    \n \n5 In contrast, the record shows that BAE followed the solicitation instructions when it \nidentified and provided required data for the [DELETED] discrete shipyard projects in its \nmanpower data sheet, e.g.,  the USS Russell as project [DELETED] , the USS Green \nBay as project  [DELETED] , and the USS [DELETED]  as project  [DELETED] .   \n6 Because the contemporaneous evaluation documents do not elaborate on why the \nagency excluded the disputed data in its calculations, BAE  contends that the agency \u2019s \npost-protest explanations  offer an impermissible post-hoc interpretation of the \nsolicitation that should be afforded little weight.  In our view,  however,  the agency \u2019s \nresponse provides a credible and consistent rationale for the Navy\u2019s contemporaneous \ndecision to disregard the manpower data for BAE\u2019s affiliate entities .  Wackenhut Servs., \n(continued...)   Page 13 B-423271   \nWe also find no basis to question the SSEB\u2019s conclusion that BAE\u2019s manpower narrative \u201cdid not provide a sufficient explanation for overcoming the manning shortfall calculated by Navy\u2019s Projected Workload via the provided BAE attachment S -4.\u201d  AR, \nTab 4, SSEB Report  at 24.  While the protester argues that the mitigation approaches \ndetailed in its manpower narrative --i.e., its hiring initiative, enterprise resource sharing, \nand subcontracting approach--should have alleviated any concern about BAE\u2019s manpower shortfall, Protest at  40-48, Comments at  29-41, the protester\u2019s arguments in \nthis regard amount to nothing more than disagreement with the agency\u2019s reasonable evaluation.    The record shows that the agency specifically considered each mitigation approach proposed in BAE\u2019s manpower narrative to determine whether the approach sufficiently mitigated the significant weakness of BAE\u2019s projected manpower shortage.  AR, Tab 4, \nSSEB Report  at 24.  For example, the SSEB considered BAE\u2019s \u201cattempt[] to mitigate \nhiring actions by hiring trades starting in March 2024\u201d and found that BAE\u2019s narrative did \u201cnot state the progress with this hiring initiative to the date of their USS RUSSELL proposal r eceipt.\u201d  Id.  The agency further explains that, while BAE\u2019s narrative stated \nthat it \u201cinitiated a hiring plan\u201d by hiring \u201c [DELETED] BAE Systems and temporary labor \npersonnel since 03\/01\/2024\u201d and planned to hire an \u201cadditional [DELETED] trade \npersonnel\u201d by December 2024, it did not explain whether its manpower charts included those [DELETED] additional FTEs or provide any detail about its plan to hire \n[DELETED] more FTEs in just three months (from September 16 to December 2024).  \nSupp. COS\/MOL at 6 n.7; see AR, Tab  2, Vol.  2B, BAE\u2019s Manpower and Small \nBusiness Participation Proposal at  9.  While the protester now presents additional \ninformation by providing interim recruitment dates and even a new chart purportedly \u201cbased directly on the data provided in the hiring approach discussi on\u201d in BAE\u2019s \nproposal, these additional details were not included in the proposal that the agency evaluated.  Comments at  35; see generally, AR, Tab  2, Vol. 2B, BAE\u2019s Manpower and \nSmall Business Participation Proposal.    Therefore, on this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s reasoned conclusion that BAE\u2019s manpower narrative did not provide sufficient information to overcome the risk presented by the assessed manpower shortage of [DELETED] \nFTEs.\n7  As noted above, the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency\u2019s \n \nInc., B-286037, B -286037.2, Nov. 14, 2000, 2001 CPD \u00b6 114 at 4- 5 (\u201cWhile we \ngenerally accord greater weight to contemporaneous evidence, we will consider post-protest explanations that provide a rationale for contemporaneous conclusions, so \nlong as those explanations are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record. \u201d).  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the agency \u2019s explanation constitutes  \nan impermissible post-hoc rationalization . \n7 Although the protester also argues that various mitigating approaches in its manpower \nnarrative should have at least improved the risk presented from a significant weakness \n(continued...)   Page 14 B-423271  discretion; a  protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without more, is \ninsufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  See Vertex Aerospace, \nLLC, supra.  \n \n Evaluation of CMSD\u2019s Manpower Proposal  \n The protester also contends that the agency evaluated manpower proposals unreasonably and unequally by calculating manpower without considering CMSD\u2019s subcontract work on various aircraft carrier projects.  Protest at  48-53; Comments \nat 41-49.  Specifically, the protester alleges that publicly available information shows \nthat CMSD has undertaken a significant manpower commitment from certain aircraft carrier subcontract work which, if included in the manpower performance calculations, would have resulted in a significant, forecasted shortage in CMSD\u2019s manpower.  Id.    \n For the purpose of the evaluation under the manpower subfactor, the solicitation required offerors to provide \u201cspecified workload data that contains historical workload performance and forecasted workload estimates.\u201d  RFP at  184.  The required workload \ndata was to be provided for all projects \u201cfor which the Offeror is the prime or a major \nsubcontractor (performing 30 [percent] or more of a CNO availability or comparable portion of a Non- Navy project).\u201d  Id.  The record shows that the SSEB assigned a rating \nof good to CMSD\u2019s manpower proposal based on two strengths assigned for calculations showing a manpower surplus of over [DELETED] FTEs under both the \nmaximum and the minimum workload scenarios.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report  at 24. \n The protester asserts, based on information it obtained from \u201cpublic sources,\u201d that \nCMSD improperly omitted data about its subcontract work on two aircraft carrier projects from its manpower data sheet and charts.  Protest at  48-53; Comments \nat 41-49; Supp. Comments at  13-16.  BAE contends that the agency unreasonably \nignored this omission during its evaluation of CMSD\u2019s manpower despite references to this work in CMSD\u2019s proposal.  Id.  The protester argues that, had CMSD included these projects in its manpower data sheet and manpower charts, the calculations would show a projected manpower shortage rather than a surplus.  Id. \n The agency responds that it reasonably did not consider the workforce data for CMSD\u2019s aircraft carrier subcontract work when evaluating CMSD\u2019s manpower proposal.  COS\/MOL at 21; Supp. COS\/MOL at  1-2.  In this regard, the agency notes that the \nsolicitation did not require offerors to explain why work was excluded from the \nmanpower data sheet and that the Navy had no reason to question CMSD\u2019s decision on what information was included in its proposal.  Supp. COS\/MOL at  2.  The agency also \nnotes that CMSD\u2019s proposal nevertheless did explain why it did not include the aircraft carrier subcontract work by explaining that it carries additional FTEs to support subcontracted work not required to be reported under this solicitation.  Id., citing AR, \n \nto a weakness, the protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency in this regard also fails to establish that the agency\u2019s judgment was unreasonable.   Page 15 B-423271  Tab 3b, Vol.  2B-7, CMSD\u2019s Manpower Narrative at  3.  Based on our review of the \nrecord, we agree with the agency.  \n \nAs an initial matter, while the solicitation required offerors to provide data about projects for which they were \u201cthe prime or a major subcontractor\u201d (defined as performing 30 percent or more of the work), it did not require offerors to provide any inform ation \nabout subcontractor projects below that threshold.  RFP at  184.  Specifically, the \nprotester appears to suggest that CMSD was required to provide detailed data about its aircraft carrier subcontract work and then allow the agency to confirm that CMSD  was \nperforming less than 30 percent of the work, see Supp. Comments at  16, but the \nsolicitation included no such requirement.  Rather, the solicitation relied on the offeror to provide the required information for projects that met the applicable solicitation definition, and advised that the manpower evaluation would be based on the information provided in the offeror\u2019s proposal.\n8  RFP at  184-186, 199- 201.  To the extent an offeror \ndetermined that a particular work effort did not meet the threshold criteria for projects required to be included in the proposal, nothing in the solicitation required the Navy to investigate beyond the four corners of the proposal  to question that determination.  \n In any event, the record shows that CMSD\u2019s proposal informed the agency that its aircraft carrier subcontract work did not fall within the definition of projects required to be included in the proposal.  In addition to explaining that it \u201c carries additional organic \nFTEs to support other subcontracted work that is  less than the 30 [percent]  of a CNO  \navailability required for reporting [in accordance with]  this solicitation ,\u201d CMSD \nspecifically referred to its aircraft carrier subcontract work as \u201c additional \u201d work that was \nnot required to be \u201creported\u201d  in its manpower proposal.  See AR, Tab  3b, Vol.  2B-7, \nCMSD\u2019s Manpower Narrative at  1 (\u201cIn addition to supporting the [DELETED] \n[availabilities], CMSD is presently supporting the following availability . . .\u201d); 2  (\u201cCMSD\u2019s \nstill has additional  labor force available not accounted for in the scheduled FTEs \ncurrently supporting non- Prime [aircraft carrier] availabilities. . . .

On this record, we \nfind that the agency reasonably did not consider CMSD\u2019s additional aircraft carrier \n \n8 The protester also complains that the agency\u2019s post -protest explanation in this regard \noffers various theories about CMSD\u2019s aircraft carrier subcontract work without any contemporaneous evaluation documentation about this work, and thus constitutes an impermissible post-hoc rationalization.  See Supp. Comments at  1-16.  As our Office \nhas noted, we do not expect an agency \u2019s evaluation report to \u201cprove a negative. \u201d  See \nBillSmart Solutions, LLC, B -413272.4, B -413272.5, Oct.  23, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 325 \nat 14 n.19.   Thus, there was no requirement for the agency  to document why it did not \nconsider information that the solicitation did not require to be included in an offeror\u2019s proposal, and which the awardee did not, in fact, include.   Page 16 B-423271  project manpower data, which fell outside the definition of projects required to be \nincluded in the offerors\u2019 manpower charts and data sheets.9   \n We similarly find that the protester\u2019s allegation that the Navy evaluated manpower disparately is unsupported by this record.  In this regard, the agency did not consider \nthis non- major subcontractor work in its manpower evaluation just as the agency \ndeclined to include BAE\u2019s affiliate manpower data (which, as discussed above, also \ndidn\u2019t satisfy the solicitation requirements) in the calculations.  Accordingly, we find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.\n10 \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n \n9 In any case, the intervenor confirms that the aircraft carrier projects were not included \nin its proposal because CMSD was not a \u201cmajor subcontractor\u201d as defined by the solicitation, performing substantially less than 30 percent of the work for those proj ects.  \nIntervenor\u2019s Supp. Comments at  1-2; Intervenor\u2019s Comments, exh.

The solicitation contemplated the \nissuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) \nfor the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and \nthe contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  \nTOR at 4.   \n The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to \ninclude  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and \nresponsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, \nproduction, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 5.  The solicitation provided for the \nevaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass\/fail basis), technical capability, and cost\/price.  Id.  at 61.  Award  was to be made \non a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of \nimportance.  Id. at 60.   The technical capability factor included the following two \nelements:  task order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.\n2  Id. at 62 -64.  As relevant here, the TOR included FAR provision \n52.222- 46.  Id. at 44 . \n After the initial evaluation of proposals, in May 2024, GSA selected Credence for award.  \nCOS at 3.  Thereafter, another unsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response, \nthe agency notified our Office of its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate \nproposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote Rsch. , Inc., B-422624, June 20, \n2024 (unpublished).  As a result, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Id. \n Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of Quantech and Credence:\n3 \n \n \n \n1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-\naward IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a \nrequest for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead \nof quotations from vendors.

For the task order management plan element, the \ncontracting officer noted that Quantech received a significant weakness; the agency did \nnot find any weaknesses in Credence\u2019s technical approach.  Id.   Given the noted \nstrengths and lower evaluated cost of Credence\u2019s proposal, the agency found that \nCredence\u2019s proposal represented the best value and issued the task order to that firm for the total amount of $221,811,016.

Thereafter, GSA opted to take corrective action to reevaluate cost \nproposals, including professional compensation plans,  and either reaffirm the award to \nCredence or make a new best -value determination.

Comments at 1 .  According to \nQuantech, GSA \u201chas not reasonably evaluated either element required by the professional compensation clause\u201d --i.e., whether the total compensation is lower than \nincumbent compensation such that it risks continuity of support , or the realism of the \ntotal compensation.\n8  Id.  For the reasons discussed below, we find the protester\u2019s \narguments provide no basis to sustain the protest.9   \n  Comparison to Incumbent Compensation  \n The protester contends that the agency\u2019s methodology for evaluating proposed total compensation plans was flawed because the agency failed to compare the proposed compensation plans with the incumbent compensation levels as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  \n As relevant here, the TOR required proposals to include a professional employee compensation plan, as prescribed in FAR provision 52.222- 46.  TOR at 4 4.  The \npurpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 is to evaluate whether offerors will obtain and keep \nthe quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance, and to evaluate whether vendors understand the nature of the work to be performed.

Supp. Memorandum of Law ( MOL ) at 2.  In conducting its evaluation,  the \nagency concluded that the instant requirement is a new requirement, not a follow -on \nrequirement.  COS at 8; AR, Tab  11, Contracting Officer (CO ) Memo for Record at  2.  In \nmaking this determination, the contracting officer explained that although \u201c this \nrequirement is a summation of multiple prior contracts (both ongoing and expired) that have been modified, combined and restructured, \u201d this requirement  is \u201cnot a direct follow -\non award.\u201d  AR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at  2.  The contracting officer found that , \n\u201c[a]s a result,  [while]  this does create an ability for possible incumbents working on \nportions of the various existing contracts to be utilized in this effort, \u201d it \u201cdoes not allow \nfor an adequate direct side by side comparison of proposed and past rates for incumbent personnel. \u201d  Id.  According to the agency, \u201cbecause this is not a recompete \neffort with true and complete incumbent compensation data available for use in the 52.222- 46 analysis, . . . the provision\u2019s requirements for recompete procurements (and \nthe GAO\u2019s stated two -part analysis for such situations) are not applicable.\u201d  MOL at 10.    \n Quantech argues that the agency unreasonably conclu ded that it had \u201cno obligation to \ncompare proposed compensation to incumbent compensation data.\u201d  Comments  at 8. \nThe protester argues that the a gency \u2019s decision not to compare proposed and \nincumbent compensation do not follow from the facts it has identified and that it is unclear why the agency could not perform a side- by-side comparison with the \nincumbent information.   Id. at 9.  In the protester\u2019s view, because the agency has \naccess to compensation data from the prior contracts, the agency is required by the FAR to compare that information to the proposed compensation data even though the agency concluded that this was not a follow -on requirement .  Supp. Comments at 3.  In \nthis regard, the protester maintains that \u201cFAR 52.222- 46 is not concerned with the label \nassigned by the agency to the procurement ( e.g., \u2018recompete,\u2019 \u2018follow -on,\u2019 or \u2018new \nrequirement\u2019),\u201d but rather, \u201cwhether the effort anticipates using professional employees to perform \u2018essentially the same professional work\u2019 they performed under a prior service contract.\u201d  Id. \n The agency asserts it  reasonably determined that this was a new acquisition, not a \nfollow- on or recompetition, and therefore, found that incumbent compensation data for \nlimited aspects of the new acquisition would not be relevant for purposes of FAR 52.222- 46.

Id. at 11. \n \nBased on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s determination that this is a new requirement and therefore the agency was not required to consider incumbent compensation data as part of its evaluation.   As referenced \nabove, FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) provides that \u201c[r]ecompetition of service contracts \nmay in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished\u201d and that \u201c[t]his lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of profess ional services needed for adequate contract performance.\u201d  The FAR further \nprovides that \u201cproposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated\u201d and cautions that \u201clowered compensation for  essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound \nmanagement judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.\u201d  FAR provision 52.222- 46(b).   As noted above, our Office has found that if an agency resolicits a \nrequirement in a follow -on procurement, FAR provision 52.222- 46(b) requires the \nagency to compare the awardee\u2019s proposed professional compensation to the incumbent contractor\u2019s.   SURVICE Eng\u2019g Co., LLC, supra .   \n Despite the protester\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the aspect of FAR provision 52.222- 46 that requires comparison to incumbent compensation is applicable to only a \n\u201crecompetition\u201d for \u201cessentially the same professional work.\u201d  FAR provision \n52.222- 46(a); (b).  Here, the agency found that the instant requirement was not a \nrecompetition for essentially the same work, but rather, a mixture of portions of five prior efforts that have been modified, combined, and restructured with new requirements.  \nAR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at 2; COS at 8.    \n As the agency further explains in response to the protest, its acquisition plan lists five predecessor contracts --some of which were awarded by GSA and others by the SSC --\nthat are blended into this requirement along with the new requirements.  Supp. MOL at 2 (quoting Supp. MOL, exh. 1, Acquisition Plan at 6) (\u201cSSC has gone through several \nmajor reorganizations and as a result this is deemed to be a new requirement and not the combining of task orders and\/or efforts.\u201d); id.  at 6-7(noting that the \u201cprevious cited \ncontracts . . . make up [only] a small subset of the totality of the work to be performed on the new requirement\u201d as the \u201cscope of work of [the new] requirement is expanded to include additional command staff support and services.\u201d).  The agency explains that \n\u201c[e]conomies of scale and cost -savings are logically anticipated to accrue to the \nawardee of this much larger and higher dollar value task order \u201d that are \u201clikely to impact \nthe amount and extent of compensation the awar dee provides its  employees as \ncontrasted to individual smaller predecessor efforts subsumed into this task order .\u201d  \nSupp. MOL at 2.   While Quantech disagrees with the agency, the protester has not \ndemonstrated that the agency\u2019s assessment was unreasonable.  This protest g round is \ndenied.  \n  Page 7    B-422624.10    Realism Evaluation  \n \nQuantech further  argues that the agency failed to properly assess the realism of \nCredence\u2019s total proposed professional compensation.  Comments at 6 .  The protester \nalso asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation was insufficient to properly assess the realism of Credence\u2019s total compensation plan ( i.e., salaries and fringe benefits) because it \nincluded consideration of the \u201ctechnical analyses\u201d performed by the agency.  Id. at 1.   \n The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019 s total compensation \nplan in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46.  In this regard, the agency contends \nthat it conducted a thorough analysis of the awardee\u2019s total compensation plan--including labor rates and fringe benefits --and reasonably found it to be realistic.  The \nagency maintains that it reasonably used recognized, acceptable techniques for evaluating the realism of the awardee\u2019s professional compensation under the circumstances of thi s acquisition.  Supp. MOL at 5.   \n Provision 52.222- 46 of the FAR calls for a cost evaluation of each offeror\u2019s \ncompensation plan that considers the realism of the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruitment and retention.

In conducting such a \ncost realism analysis, an agency is not required to conduct an in- depth cost analysis, or \nto verify each and every item in assessing cost realism; rather, the evaluation requires the exercise of informed judgment by the contracting agency.  Id.  Additionally, an \nagency \u2019s cost realism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the \nmethodology employed must be reasonable and realistic in view of other cost \ninformation reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.

See AR,  Tab 11, CO Memo for Record  \nat 2; COS at 8 .  For this comparison, each skill level  was compared to the \ncommensurate BLS wage percentiles.   Id.  The evaluators then performed an impact \nanalysis on the direct labor rates that fell significantly (more than 10 percent) below the BLS wage e stimates and adjusted the questioned direct labor rates upwards to the \nequivalent BLS rates in order to estimate the total impact.  AR, Tab 10, ADM at 47-49; \nSupp. MOL at 6.    \n  Page 8    B-422624.10   Next, with regard to proposed fringe benefits, the agency analyzed the reasonableness \nand realism of the offerors\u2019 proposed fringe rates by conducting a side- by-side \ncomparison of the rates provided by each offeror.11  COS at 11 -12; AR, Tab 11, \nCO Memo for Record at 6 (noting that Credence\u2019s and Quantech\u2019s proposed fringe \nrates are part of their Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA)  approved provisional \nbilling rates and that both offerors\u2019 proposals applied their approved fringe rates).   For \nexample, this comparison showed that Quantech and Credence proposed \u201c [DELETED] \u201d \n([DELETED]  percent for Quantech and [DELETED]  percent for Credence).  AR, Tab 11, \nCO Memo for Record at 5-6.   \n \nIn addition, the contracting officer , who also served as the source selection authority for \nthe procurement,  expressly noted her consideration of Credence\u2019s fringe benefits, \nincluding flexible paid time off , [DELETED]  of vacation and [DELETED]  holidays, 401(k) \nindividual retirement account savings plan with e mployer matching up to [DELETED] , as \nwell as company  shared premiums for healthcare and disability insurance for \nemployees.  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for Record at 6 .  The contracting officer also noted \nthat the technical evaluation team assigned  Credence a strength for its hiring and \nretention policies , which she found supports the a gency determination that Credence \nwill be able to fulfill the contract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for \nsuccessful contract performance.   AR, Tab 10, A DM at 26.  Based on this analysis, the \nagency concluded that Credence\u2019s proposed compensation levels reflect a clear understanding of the work to be performed and the capability to obtain and keep \nsuitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives .  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for \nRecord at 2. \n \nWhile the protester asserts that it was improper for the agency to consider the findings \nfrom the  technical evaluation in assessing the awardee\u2019s proposed compensation plan, \nwe find nothing unreasonable about the contracting officer\u2019s consider ation of  the \nstrength assessed for Credence\u2019s hiring and retention policies, which the contracting \nofficer found supports the agency \u2019s determination that Credence will be able to fulfill the \ncontract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for successful contract performance.   We have previously found an agency\u2019s consideration of  similar findings \nreasonable.

This redacted version has been approved for public release.  Page 2    B-422624.10   BACKGROUND  \n \nGSA issued the TOR on January 30, 2024, under the procedures of Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, to holders of GSA \u2019s One Acquisition Solution for \nIntegrated Services (OASIS) small business indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) \ncontract pool 5B .1  Agency Report (AR), Tab 2, TOR amend. 0009 (hereinafter TOR) \nat 3; Contracting Officer's Statement (COS) at 1.  The solicitation contemplated the \nissuance of a task order , using cost-plus-fixed -fee contract line item numbers (CLINs) \nfor the two main CLINs and cost -reimbursable (no fee)  CLINs for other direct costs and \nthe contract access fee, with a 12- month base period and four  1-year option periods.  \nTOR at 4.   \n The agency sought proposals for advisory and assistance services to the SSC, to \ninclude  acquisition, financial, and administrative capabilities to execute effective and \nresponsive integrated program management of space- related research, development, \nproduction, and lifecycle acquisition activities .  Id. at 5.  The solicitation provided for the \nevaluation of proposals based on three factors:  quality control plan (to be evaluated on a pass\/fail basis), technical capability, and cost\/price.  Id.  at 61.  Award  was to be made \non a best -value tradeoff basis considering the latter t wo factors , in descending order of \nimportance.  Id. at 60.   The technical capability factor included the following two \nelements:  task order management plan and contractor experience with command staff support requirements.\n2  Id. at 62 -64.  As relevant here, the TOR included FAR provision \n52.222- 46.  Id. at 44 . \n After the initial evaluation of proposals, in May 2024, GSA selected Credence for award.  \nCOS at 3.  Thereafter, another unsuccessful offeror filed a protest at GAO.  In response, \nthe agency notified our Office of its decision to take corrective action to reevaluate \nproposals and make a new award decision.  Tecolote Rsch. , Inc., B-422624, June 20, \n2024 (unpublished).  As a result, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Id. \n Upon completion of the reevaluation, the agency assigned the following overall ratings to the proposals of Quantech and Credence:\n3 \n \n \n \n1 Although the procurement at issue here was a task order competition under a multiple-\naward IDIQ contract, the agency issued the solicitation as a TOR , rather than as a \nrequest for quotations, and refers to the submission of proposals from offerors instead \nof quotations from vendors.  For consistency and ease of reference to the record, we do \nthe same.  \n2 The TOR explained that these two elements \u201cwill not be individually rated and are not \nsubfactors,\u201d but rather, \u201c[t]hey are areas of emphasis for offerors to focus their attention on and there will be only one (1) overall technical rating.\u201d  TOR at 61.  \n3 The TOR provided that technical capability would be evaluated as exceptional, good, \nacceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.

For the task order management plan element, the \ncontracting officer noted that Quantech received a significant weakness; the agency did \nnot find any weaknesses in Credence\u2019s technical approach.

Given the noted \nstrengths and lower evaluated cost of Credence\u2019s proposal, the agency found that \nCredence\u2019s proposal represented the best value and issued the task order to that firm for the total amount of $221,811,016.  Id.  at 55- 56, 58.  \n The agency notified Quantech on October 17, 2024, that its proposal had not been \nselected for award.  COS at 4.  Thereafter, Quantech and two other unsuccessful \nofferors filed protests at GAO.\n5  Quantech\u2019s protest challenged the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof proposals, including the evaluation of Credence\u2019s proposed professional employee compensation plan.  After development of the record, t he GAO attorney assigned to the \nprotest conducted outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution (ADR) with the parties, explaining that the record did not reflect that GSA had properly evaluated Credence\u2019s proposed professional compensation plan as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Thereafter, GSA opted to take corrective action to reevaluate cost \nproposals, including professional compensation plans,  and either reaffirm the award to \nCredence or make a new best -value determination.

Comments at 1 .  According to \nQuantech, GSA \u201chas not reasonably evaluated either element required by the professional compensation clause\u201d --i.e., whether the total compensation is lower than \nincumbent compensation such that it risks continuity of support , or the realism of the \ntotal compensation.\n8  Id.  For the reasons discussed below, we find the protester\u2019s \narguments provide no basis to sustain the protest.9   \n  Comparison to Incumbent Compensation  \n The protester contends that the agency\u2019s methodology for evaluating proposed total compensation plans was flawed because the agency failed to compare the proposed compensation plans with the incumbent compensation levels as required by FAR provision 52.222- 46.  \n As relevant here, the TOR required proposals to include a professional employee compensation plan, as prescribed in FAR provision 52.222- 46.  TOR at 4 4.  The \npurpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 is to evaluate whether offerors will obtain and keep \nthe quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance, and to evaluate whether vendors understand the nature of the work to be performed.

COS at 8; AR, Tab  11, Contracting Officer (CO ) Memo for Record at  2.  In \nmaking this determination, the contracting officer explained that although \u201c this \nrequirement is a summation of multiple prior contracts (both ongoing and expired) that have been modified, combined and restructured, \u201d this requirement  is \u201cnot a direct follow -\non award.\u201d  AR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at  2.  The contracting officer found that , \n\u201c[a]s a result,  [while]  this does create an ability for possible incumbents working on \nportions of the various existing contracts to be utilized in this effort, \u201d it \u201cdoes not allow \nfor an adequate direct side by side comparison of proposed and past rates for incumbent personnel. \u201d  Id.  According to the agency, \u201cbecause this is not a recompete \neffort with true and complete incumbent compensation data available for use in the 52.222- 46 analysis, . . . the provision\u2019s requirements for recompete procurements (and \nthe GAO\u2019s stated two -part analysis for such situations) are not applicable.\u201d  MOL at 10.    \n Quantech argues that the agency unreasonably conclu ded that it had \u201cno obligation to \ncompare proposed compensation to incumbent compensation data.\u201d  Comments  at 8. \nThe protester argues that the a gency \u2019s decision not to compare proposed and \nincumbent compensation do not follow from the facts it has identified and that it is unclear why the agency could not perform a side- by-side comparison with the \nincumbent information.   Id. at 9.  In the protester\u2019s view, because the agency has \naccess to compensation data from the prior contracts, the agency is required by the FAR to compare that information to the proposed compensation data even though the agency concluded that this was not a follow -on requirement .  Supp. Comments at 3.  In \nthis regard, the protester maintains that \u201cFAR 52.222- 46 is not concerned with the label \nassigned by the agency to the procurement ( e.g., \u2018recompete,\u2019 \u2018follow -on,\u2019 or \u2018new \nrequirement\u2019),\u201d but rather, \u201cwhether the effort anticipates using professional employees to perform \u2018essentially the same professional work\u2019 they performed under a prior service contract.\u201d  Id. \n The agency asserts it  reasonably determined that this was a new acquisition, not a \nfollow- on or recompetition, and therefore, found that incumbent compensation data for \nlimited aspects of the new acquisition would not be relevant for purposes of FAR 52.222- 46.

Id. at 11. \n \nBased on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s determination that this is a new requirement and therefore the agency was not required to consider incumbent compensation data as part of its evaluation.   As referenced \nabove, FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) provides that \u201c[r]ecompetition of service contracts \nmay in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished\u201d and that \u201c[t]his lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of profess ional services needed for adequate contract performance.\u201d  The FAR further \nprovides that \u201cproposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated\u201d and cautions that \u201clowered compensation for  essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound \nmanagement judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.\u201d  FAR provision 52.222- 46(b).   As noted above, our Office has found that if an agency resolicits a \nrequirement in a follow -on procurement, FAR provision 52.222- 46(b) requires the \nagency to compare the awardee\u2019s proposed professional compensation to the incumbent contractor\u2019s.   SURVICE Eng\u2019g Co., LLC, supra .   \n Despite the protester\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the aspect of FAR provision 52.222- 46 that requires comparison to incumbent compensation is applicable to only a \n\u201crecompetition\u201d for \u201cessentially the same professional work.\u201d  FAR provision \n52.222- 46(a); (b).  Here, the agency found that the instant requirement was not a \nrecompetition for essentially the same work, but rather, a mixture of portions of five prior efforts that have been modified, combined, and restructured with new requirements.  \nAR, Tab  11, CO Memo for Record at 2; COS at 8.    \n As the agency further explains in response to the protest, its acquisition plan lists five predecessor contracts --some of which were awarded by GSA and others by the SSC --\nthat are blended into this requirement along with the new requirements.  Supp. MOL at 2 (quoting Supp. MOL, exh. 1, Acquisition Plan at 6) (\u201cSSC has gone through several \nmajor reorganizations and as a result this is deemed to be a new requirement and not the combining of task orders and\/or efforts.\u201d); id.  at 6-7(noting that the \u201cprevious cited \ncontracts . . . make up [only] a small subset of the totality of the work to be performed on the new requirement\u201d as the \u201cscope of work of [the new] requirement is expanded to include additional command staff support and services.\u201d).  The agency explains that \n\u201c[e]conomies of scale and cost -savings are logically anticipated to accrue to the \nawardee of this much larger and higher dollar value task order \u201d that are \u201clikely to impact \nthe amount and extent of compensation the awar dee provides its  employees as \ncontrasted to individual smaller predecessor efforts subsumed into this task order .\u201d  \nSupp. MOL at 2.

Comments at 6 .  The protester \nalso asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation was insufficient to properly assess the realism of Credence\u2019s total compensation plan ( i.e., salaries and fringe benefits) because it \nincluded consideration of the \u201ctechnical analyses\u201d performed by the agency.  Id. at 1.   \n The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019 s total compensation \nplan in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46.  In this regard, the agency contends \nthat it conducted a thorough analysis of the awardee\u2019s total compensation plan--including labor rates and fringe benefits --and reasonably found it to be realistic.  The \nagency maintains that it reasonably used recognized, acceptable techniques for evaluating the realism of the awardee\u2019s professional compensation under the circumstances of thi s acquisition.  Supp. MOL at 5.   \n Provision 52.222- 46 of the FAR calls for a cost evaluation of each offeror\u2019s \ncompensation plan that considers the realism of the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruitment and retention.

In conducting such a \ncost realism analysis, an agency is not required to conduct an in- depth cost analysis, or \nto verify each and every item in assessing cost realism; rather, the evaluation requires the exercise of informed judgment by the contracting agency.  Id.  Additionally, an \nagency \u2019s cost realism analysis need not achieve scientific certainty; rather, the \nmethodology employed must be reasonable and realistic in view of other cost \ninformation reasonably available to the agency as of the time of its evaluation.

See AR,  Tab 11, CO Memo for Record  \nat 2; COS at 8 .  For this comparison, each skill level  was compared to the \ncommensurate BLS wage percentiles.   Id.  The evaluators then performed an impact \nanalysis on the direct labor rates that fell significantly (more than 10 percent) below the BLS wage e stimates and adjusted the questioned direct labor rates upwards to the \nequivalent BLS rates in order to estimate the total impact.  AR, Tab 10, ADM at 47-49; \nSupp. MOL at 6.    \n  Page 8    B-422624.10   Next, with regard to proposed fringe benefits, the agency analyzed the reasonableness \nand realism of the offerors\u2019 proposed fringe rates by conducting a side- by-side \ncomparison of the rates provided by each offeror.11  COS at 11 -12; AR, Tab 11, \nCO Memo for Record at 6 (noting that Credence\u2019s and Quantech\u2019s proposed fringe \nrates are part of their Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA)  approved provisional \nbilling rates and that both offerors\u2019 proposals applied their approved fringe rates).   For \nexample, this comparison showed that Quantech and Credence proposed \u201c [DELETED] \u201d \n([DELETED]  percent for Quantech and [DELETED]  percent for Credence).  AR, Tab 11, \nCO Memo for Record at 5-6.   \n \nIn addition, the contracting officer , who also served as the source selection authority for \nthe procurement,  expressly noted her consideration of Credence\u2019s fringe benefits, \nincluding flexible paid time off , [DELETED]  of vacation and [DELETED]  holidays, 401(k) \nindividual retirement account savings plan with e mployer matching up to [DELETED] , as \nwell as company  shared premiums for healthcare and disability insurance for \nemployees.  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for Record at 6 .  The contracting officer also noted \nthat the technical evaluation team assigned  Credence a strength for its hiring and \nretention policies , which she found supports the a gency determination that Credence \nwill be able to fulfill the contract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for \nsuccessful contract performance.   AR, Tab 10, A DM at 26.  Based on this analysis, the \nagency concluded that Credence\u2019s proposed compensation levels reflect a clear understanding of the work to be performed and the capability to obtain and keep \nsuitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives .  AR, Tab 11, CO Memo for \nRecord at 2. \n \nWhile the protester asserts that it was improper for the agency to consider the findings \nfrom the  technical evaluation in assessing the awardee\u2019s proposed compensation plan, \nwe find nothing unreasonable about the contracting officer\u2019s consider ation of  the \nstrength assessed for Credence\u2019s hiring and retention policies, which the contracting \nofficer found supports the agency \u2019s determination that Credence will be able to fulfill the \ncontract requirements and retain the personnel necessary for successful contract performance.   We have previously found an agency\u2019s consideration of  similar findings \nreasonable.

Protest challenging agency\u2019s technical evaluation of protester\u2019s quotation is denied where evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.   2. Protest alleging that agency was required to seek clarifications before finding protester\u2019s quotation to be unacceptable is denied where agency was under no obligation to do so.  \nDECISION  \n OReady, LLC, a woman- owned small -business of Las Vegas, Nevada, protests the \naward of a contract to ULU Hi -Tech, Inc., a small business of Honolulu, Hawaii, under \nrequest for quotations (RFQ) No. 1305M324Q0286, issued by the Department of \nCommerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for  Linux system \nsupport services.  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably excluded OReady from the competition for failing to meet the solicitation\u2019s technical requirements.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation as a small business set -aside on July 19, 2024, using \nthe simplified acquisition procedures  for commercial  products and services  set forth in \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13 and subpart 12.6.  Agency Report (AR),  Page 2 B-422910.2  Tab 1, RFQ at 1,  3.1  The agency sought Linux system support services for the N ational \nWeather Service  (NWS) , including services to install, support, secure, and troubleshoot \nits Linux systems for the NWS  Pacific Region offices.  Id. at 1.  The RFQ contemplated \nthe award of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials contract, for one base year and \nfour 1-year options.  Id.  at 3-5, 79.  \n \nThe solicitation provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, \nconsidering the following evaluation factors:  technical capability, management \napproach, staffing plan, and price.  Id. at 81- 82.  The n on-price factors, when combined, \nwere approximately equal in importance to price.  Id.  at 81.  The solicitation required \nvendors to submit quotations in two volumes:  a technical quotation and a price quotation.  Id.  at 51.  Further, the RFQ  warned vendors that only \u201cquotes that address \nand meet all requirements set forth in this solicitation will be considered acceptable, \u201d \nand failure to provide required information may  result in the quotation being  \u201cexcluded \nfrom further evaluation and rejected without further notification to the [vendor].\u201d   Id. \nat 53. \n The agency received quotations from 16 vendors , including the protester.

Protest at 3.   \n The agency conducted this procurement using simplified acquisition procedures for \ncommercial services.

The Offeror \nmust provide performance measures in addition to those stated in the PWS that are meaningful, measurable, challenging and show the Offeror\u2019s ability to meet the objectives identified in the PWS.  \n RFQ at 54.   The solicitation also noted that \u201c[t]he Quality Control Plan will be evaluated \nto determine how well the Offeror demonstrates quality oversight and how quality standards, as outlined in the Performance Requirements Summary, will be achieved and maintained during performance.\u201d  Id. at 81.   \n The record reflects  that OReady, in response to the RFQ, submitted a 12- page \ntechnical quotation.  AR, Tab 4, Protester\u2019s Technical Quotation.  Within that quotation, \nthe only reference to a  QCP appeared on page 4 , which stated:   \n \nQuality Assurance:  A  draft Quality Control Plan will be developed and \nimplemented.   This plan will include performance measures such as \nsystem uptime, incident response times, and adherence to security standards.  These metrics will be regularly reviewed to ensure high- quality \nservice delivery.   Page 4 B-422910.2   \nId. at 4.  The agency notes, and the record confirms, that although OReady  state d that it \nwill develop a draft QCP, no QCP --draft or otherwise--was included in the protester\u2019s \nquotation.

Protest challenging agency\u2019s technical evaluation of protester\u2019s quotation is denied where evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.   2. Protest alleging that agency was required to seek clarifications before finding protester\u2019s quotation to be unacceptable is denied where agency was under no obligation to do so.  \nDECISION  \n OReady, LLC, a woman- owned small -business of Las Vegas, Nevada, protests the \naward of a contract to ULU Hi -Tech, Inc., a small business of Honolulu, Hawaii, under \nrequest for quotations (RFQ) No. 1305M324Q0286, issued by the Department of \nCommerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for  Linux system \nsupport services.  The protester contends that the agency unreasonably excluded OReady from the competition for failing to meet the solicitation\u2019s technical requirements.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation as a small business set -aside on July 19, 2024, using \nthe simplified acquisition procedures  for commercial  products and services  set forth in \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13 and subpart 12.6.  Agency Report (AR),  Page 2 B-422910.2  Tab 1, RFQ at 1,  3.1  The agency sought Linux system support services for the N ational \nWeather Service  (NWS) , including services to install, support, secure, and troubleshoot \nits Linux systems for the NWS  Pacific Region offices.  Id. at 1.  The RFQ contemplated \nthe award of a hybrid fixed- price and time- and-materials contract, for one base year and \nfour 1-year options.  Id.  at 3-5, 79.  \n \nThe solicitation provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, \nconsidering the following evaluation factors:  technical capability, management \napproach, staffing plan, and price.  Id. at 81- 82.  The n on-price factors, when combined, \nwere approximately equal in importance to price.  Id.  at 81.  The solicitation required \nvendors to submit quotations in two volumes:  a technical quotation and a price quotation.  Id.  at 51.  Further, the RFQ  warned vendors that only \u201cquotes that address \nand meet all requirements set forth in this solicitation will be considered acceptable, \u201d \nand failure to provide required information may  result in the quotation being  \u201cexcluded \nfrom further evaluation and rejected without further notification to the [vendor].\u201d   Id. \nat 53. \n The agency received quotations from 16 vendors , including the protester.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 5; AR, Tab 5, Feb. 12 Unsuccessful Offeror Notice at 1.  On August 30, 2024, NOAA made award to ULU High- Tech, Inc.  COS at 6.  That \naward decision resulted in a protest  to our Office  from Tatra Solutions, Inc. , an \nunsuccessful vendor.   Id.  In response to Tatra\u2019s protest , the agency notified our Office \nthat it would take corrective action by reev aluating the non- price factors of vendors \u2019 \nquotations and making a new source selection decision.  Tatra Sols., Inc. , B-422910, \nOct. 10, 2024 (unpublished decision).  As a result  of the agency\u2019s proposed corrective \naction, o ur Office dismissed the  protest as academic on October 10.  Id.   \n On February 26, 2025, t he agency notified all vendors, including O Ready, of the result \nof the reevaluation.  COS at 8 .  In the agency\u2019s notice to OReady, NOAA advised the \nprotester that its quotation had failed to meet the solicitation requirement to provide a draft quality control plan.  AR,  Tab 8, OReady Unsuccessful Vendor Notice at 1.  \nOReady filed an agency -level protest  on February 28,  contending that NOAA had \nunreasonably evaluated its quotation.  AR, Tab 9, Agency -Level Protest.  On March 26, \nNOAA denied the  agency -level protest.  AR, Tab 10, Agency -Level Protest Decision \nat 8.  OReady , subsequently,  filed a timely protest with our Office on April 1.   \n DISCUSSION  The protester argues that NOAA unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  Specifically, OReady contends that the agency improperly found that the protester\u2019s quotation failed to include a draft quality control plan (QCP), and that the agency should have engaged \nin clarifications with the protester about the QCP.  Protest at 3.  The agency responds that its evaluation of the protester\u2019s quotation was reasonable, and the agency was not \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted, citations to the record are to the sequential page numbers of \nthe Adobe PDF documents.

We have reviewed all of the protester\u2019s arguments, and we find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.   \n \nTechnical Quotation  \n The agency eliminated OReady from the competition for failing to include a draft QCP in \nits quotation.  AR, Tab 7, Award Determination at 2.  The protester argues that it did, in fact, include the required plan in its quotation.  Protest at 3.   \n The agency conducted this procurement using simplified acquisition procedures for \ncommercial services.  When using these procedures , an agency must conduct the \nprocurement consistent with a concern for fair and equitable competition and must evaluate quotations in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.

In reviewing a protest \nchallenging an agency \u2019s evaluation under simplified procedures, our Office will not \nreevaluate quotations, but instead, will examine the record to determine whether the agency \u2019s judgment was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria \nand applicable procurement statutes and regulations.

The Offeror \nmust provide performance measures in addition to those stated in the PWS that are meaningful, measurable, challenging and show the Offeror\u2019s ability to meet the objectives identified in the PWS.  \n RFQ at 54.   The solicitation also noted that \u201c[t]he Quality Control Plan will be evaluated \nto determine how well the Offeror demonstrates quality oversight and how quality standards, as outlined in the Performance Requirements Summary, will be achieved and maintained during performance.\u201d  Id. at 81.   \n The record reflects  that OReady, in response to the RFQ, submitted a 12- page \ntechnical quotation.  AR, Tab 4, Protester\u2019s Technical Quotation.  Within that quotation, \nthe only reference to a  QCP appeared on page 4 , which stated:   \n \nQuality Assurance:  A  draft Quality Control Plan will be developed and \nimplemented.   This plan will include performance measures such as \nsystem uptime, incident response times, and adherence to security standards.  These metrics will be regularly reviewed to ensure high- quality \nservice delivery.   Page 4 B-422910.2   \nId. at 4.  The agency notes, and the record confirms, that although OReady  state d that it \nwill develop a draft QCP, no QCP --draft or otherwise--was included in the protester\u2019s \nquotation.  See  id.; see also MOL at 6 (\u201cThe plain language of OReady\u2019s quote \ndemonstrates OReady did not provide a draft QCP as required by the Solicitation but merely expressed that a plan would be drafted in the future.\u201d).  \n In its comments to the agency report, OReady references  multiple pages of  its technical \nquotation where the firm allegedly included information pertaining to a draft quality \ncontrol plan.

The protester contends that the agency\u2019s cancellation of the solicitation is unreasonable and improper . \n We deny  the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On March 1, 2024,  using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 36.6 \nprocedures, the Army Corps of Engineers issued the synopsis  seeking an architect -\nengineer firm to provide construction management services  \u201cto build medical facilities \nthat serve our Veterans throughout the state[s] of Oregon and Washington.\u201d  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, Synopsis at 1.  \nThe synopsis contemplated the award of a single indefinite- delivery , indefinite -quantity  Page 2 B-423332  (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance  of five years , beginning on the date of \ncontract award, and a \u201ctotal capacity\u201d of $25 million.  Id.  at 2.   \n \nThe synopsis further state d that the IDIQ contract would have a minimum guaranteed \namount of  $10,000, a minimum task order amount of $3,000, and that \u201c[m] ultiple  task \norders are anticipated to be awarded between $1M and $5M in support of this project. \u201d  \nId.  The synopsis identified six upcoming VA projects as follows:  \n \nLocation  Construction Contract Type  ECC (DFARS 236.204)[1] \nPortland [District VA \n(DVA)]  Phase 2  Design -Build  Over $500,000,000  \nWhite City Package 1  Design -Build  $250,000,000 - $500,000,000  \nWhite City Package 2  Design -Bid-Build  $25,000,000 - $100,000,000  \nRoseburg VA  To be determined (T BD) $250,000,000 - $500,000,000  \nAmerica Lake VA  TBD TBD \nSeattle VA  TBD TBD \n \nId. at 3.  On September 27, 2024, the agency advised the protester that it was  found to \nbe the most highly qualified firm, and the agency would send a formal solicitation in the \ncoming weeks.  Protest at 5.  However, on February 13, 2025, the agency informed the \nprotester :  \u201cUnfortunately, the U.S Army Corp of Engineers, Portland District, needs to \ncancel the subject requirement and solicitation in its entirety in accordance with FAR \n15.206(e).  Should a similar requirement be identified in the future a new solicitation will be issued.\u201d   Id. at 6.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the decision to cancel the solicitation is unreasonable and unjustified by the agency.  Protest at 2.  The agency responds that cancellation of the \nsolicitation was reasonable because some of the anticipated projects have been canceled and it does not otherwise have the funding to support the requirement.  For the reasons discussed below, we find the agency reasonably canceled the solicitation and deny the protest.  \n As an initial matter, the protester contends, and the agency concedes, that FAR section 15.206(e) is inapplicable and improperly cited in the cancellation letter.\n2  Protest at 6; \n \n1 The FAR requires that a solicitation  state  the estimated cost of construction (ECC) \u201cin \nterms of physical characteristics and estimated price range.\u201d  FAR 36.204.  The Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) prescribes additional price ranges exceeding $10,000,000.  DFARS 236.204.  \n2 That FAR section states:  \u201cIf, in the judgment of the contracting officer, based on \nmarket research or otherwise, an amendment proposed for issuance after offers have been received is so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could \n(continued...)   Page 3 B-423332  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   However, the agency argues that even if FAR section \n15.206(e) was incorrectly  cited, this error does not constitute a procurement violation \nwhere a reasonable basis for cancellation of the solicitation otherwise exists.  We agree.  \nAs discussed below, the record shows that the agency canceled the solicitation \nbecause the requirements changed, and it no longer had funding to proceed with an award.  Accordingly, we dismiss  this allegation.\n3  See U.S. Marine Mgmt. , Inc. ,  \nB-417353.3, B -417353.4, Sept. 23, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 346 at 4 (\u201c[N]ew or additional \nrationale justifying the cancellation of a solicitation provided by an agency during the development of a protest is acceptable so long as it would have supported cancellation had it been advanced originally.\u201d) .   \n Regarding cancellation of the solicitation, t he agency explains  that the most immediate \nrequirements have been canceled by the Portland District VA and associated funding \nreturned to the VA, and the next  scheduled project  listed in the synopsis will not occur \nfor well over a year .  Req. for Dismissal at 2; COS at 1  (\u00b6\u00b6 2 and 4 ).  Specifically, t he \ncontracting officer states:  \u201cI canceled the Solicitation due to the removal of Portland DVA Phase 2 as a requirement and because the first requirement [White City Package 1] would now not be needed until May 2026 at earliest.\u201d  Id.  (\u00b6 6).  The contracting \nofficer further states that the VA has not yet provided funding to the Corps for the construction phase of White City Package 1 or for any of the remaining projects \nincluded in the synopsis.\n4  Supp. COS at 1 (\u00b6\u00b6 3 and 4).  \n \n \nhave anticipated, so that additional sources likely would have submitted offers had the substance of the amendment been known to them, the contracting officer shall cancel the original solicitation and issue a new one, regardless of the stage of the acquis ition. \u201d  \nFAR 15.206(e).   As discussed in this decision, a change in the requirements did not \nexceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated;  to the contrary, \nrequirements were removed from the procurement.   Moreover, the agency did not \npropose to issue an amendment to the solicitation.  Accordingly, FAR section 15.206(e) \nis not applicable to this procurement . \n3 The protester also argues that a \u201cdismissed size protest\u201d and \u201cunusual circumstances \nsurrounding the lack of communication from [the agency],\u201d including a change in the contracting officer assigned to the procurement, are \u201chighly irregular.\u201d  Protest at 3.  In \nthis regard, the record shows that a challenge to the size status of the protester, filed on November 15, 2024, was subsequently dismissed by the Small Business Administration as untimely and was unrelated to the agency\u2019s decision to cancel the solicitation.  Supp. COS at 1 (\u00b6 1).  Moreover, the protester\u2019s general dissatisfaction with the frequency or content of the agency\u2019s communications fails to establish that a violation of procurement statute or regulation occurred.  Accordingly, we find this allegation to be legally and factually insufficient and therefore dismiss it.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.1(c)(4), 21.5(f).  \n4 The agency also explains that VA projects are funded using interagency agreement \nforms that give the Corps the authority to spend VA funds,  and that the agreement \nassociated with this project was modified to return all funding to the VA.  Supp. COS at 1 (\u00b6 2).   Page 4 B-423332  In rebuttal , the protester contends that proceeding with the solicitation is justified \nbecause it will ensure that the contract is in place before the White City Package 1 \nproject begins , and the remaining projects further  justify proceeding with the solicitation \nand contract negotiation and award.  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1 (\u201cTwo of the noted \nprojects are over $250 million dollars.  Even with a conservative estimate of typical \nconstruction management contracts for this Agency, either one of those pr ojects justify \nthis IDIQ by themselves. \u201d).  The protester further contends  that it is \u201cnot unusual for \nindefinite delivery contracts to be awarded and not used for a period of time due to fluctuating requirements \u2013  this is the reason to award this flexible contract in the first \nplace. \u201d  Resp. to Supp. COS at 2.   \n In a negotiated procurement, such as the one here, a contracting agency has broad discretion in deciding whether to cancel a solicitation and need only establish a reasonable basis for doing so.

Lasmer Indus., Inc., B-400866.2 et al. , Mar. 30, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 77 at 4- 5.   \n It is also well established that an agency\u2019s lack of funding for a procurement provides a reasonable basis for cancellation, as agencies may not award contracts that exceed available funds.

It is not our role \nto question the unavailability of funds.  Welch Constr., Inc. , supra; VetPride Servs., Inc. , \nsupra at 3.  Rather, the management of an agency\u2019s funds generally depends on the \nagency\u2019s judgment concerning which projects and activities should receive increased or  reduced funding.  T.W. Recycling , supra.  Moreover, an agency may properly cancel a \nsolicitation regardless of when the information precipitating the cancellation first surfaces or should have been known.

S ynopsis at 1 (\u201cThe contractor awarded this [construction management \nservices architectural -engineering single- award task order contract] will be required to \nreview and validate work performed under construction contracts[.]\u201d) ; id. at 3 (\u201cWork \nmay be performed on VA mega construction, VA general construction, or VA services and supply contracts to monitor contractor progress and document compliance with the \nplans, specifications, and ancillary documents.\u201d) .  The record shows that  approximately \nfour months after the protester was selected  as the most highly qualified firm , the Corps \nwas directed by the VA to cancel the solicitation and return the funding for the Portland \nDVA Phase 2  project , the first anticipated project  included in the synopsis.  AR, Tab 7, \nLetter from VA to Army, Jan. 22, 2025.  The record further shows that funding for the Portland DVA Phase 2 project was returned to the VA and was the only funding ever  Page 5 B-423332  provided to the Corps for any of the upcoming VA projects included in the synopsis .  \nSupp. COS at 1 (\u00b6 4).  Thus, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s decision to cancel the \nsolicitation where the initial project was no longer required, and the agency represents it \ndoes  not currently have funding to make an award.  \n The protester also argues:  \u201c The cancellation of Portland DVA phase 2 (January 22, \n2025) did not happen for almost [four]  months after our selection, and this seems to be \nthe sole reason given for the cancellation.  It appears to us there is some other pre-\ntextual reason for the delays and subsequent attempted cancellation that we are not aware of. \u201d  Resp. to Supp. COS  at 3.  According to the protester,  \n \nRe-advertising the same requirement in the near future for work just over \n[one]  year away is wasteful to the Government, as well as introducing \nsignificant risk that the contract and accompanying task order would not be placed in time for the potential requirement.  This scenario would \ncause unnecessary re- work on behalf of the industry and more \nimportantly, wasting Government resources managing another lengthy procurement process that was already advertised, evaluated, interviewed, and selected.  The Gover nment and each industry \nrespondent will spend significantly more than the $10,000 guaranteed minimum that seems to be at issue here.  \n Id. \n As discussed, an agency may properly cancel a solicitation regardless of when the \ninformation precipitating the cancellation first surfaces or should have been known, even if the solicitation is not canceled until after proposals have been submitted and evaluated, or even after a contract has been awarded.  Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , \nB-419989.6, B -419989.7, Feb. 28, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 59 at 8 .  In this case, w e do not \nfind the lapse in time between the protester\u2019s selection and the cancellation of the solicitation --a four -month period during which a size protest occurred--to be a significant \ndelay.  In deed, the concern raised by the protester , namely  that time and resources will \nbe wasted by the cancellation,  could only be further compounded if the agency were to \nproceed with the solicitation  and none of the upcoming projects  are funded by the VA in \nthe future.  As stated, it is not our role to question the unavailability of funds.  Welch \nConstr., Inc., supra; VetPride Servs., Inc., supra at 3.  Ther e is nothing in the record to \nsupport  the protester\u2019s claim  that delays in issuing the solicitation and its  subsequent \ncancel lation  indicate the agency\u2019s actions  are pretextual and given that government \nofficials are presumed to act in good faith, we find no merit to these allegations.  See Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , supra at 9.   \n \nIn sum, the initial project included in the synopsis was no longer required, the next \nproject is not planned to commence for over a year, and the agency represents that it currently lacks funding for any of the remaining project requirements.  Under these  \n  Page 6 B-423332  circumstances, we find no basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s decision to cancel the \nsolicitation was unreasonable or improper.   \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

This scenario would \ncause unnecessary re- work on behalf of the industry and more \nimportantly, wasting Government resources managing another lengthy procurement process that was already advertised, evaluated, interviewed, and selected.  The Gover nment and each industry \nrespondent will spend significantly more than the $10,000 guaranteed minimum that seems to be at issue here.  \n Id. \n As discussed, an agency may properly cancel a solicitation regardless of when the \ninformation precipitating the cancellation first surfaces or should have been known, even if the solicitation is not canceled until after proposals have been submitted and evaluated, or even after a contract has been awarded.  Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , \nB-419989.6, B -419989.7, Feb. 28, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 59 at 8 .  In this case, w e do not \nfind the lapse in time between the protester\u2019s selection and the cancellation of the solicitation --a four -month period during which a size protest occurred--to be a significant \ndelay.  In deed, the concern raised by the protester , namely  that time and resources will \nbe wasted by the cancellation,  could only be further compounded if the agency were to \nproceed with the solicitation  and none of the upcoming projects  are funded by the VA in \nthe future.  As stated, it is not our role to question the unavailability of funds.  Welch \nConstr., Inc., supra; VetPride Servs., Inc., supra at 3.  Ther e is nothing in the record to \nsupport  the protester\u2019s claim  that delays in issuing the solicitation and its  subsequent \ncancel lation  indicate the agency\u2019s actions  are pretextual and given that government \nofficials are presumed to act in good faith, we find no merit to these allegations.  See Bear Mountainside Realty, LLC , supra at 9.   \n \nIn sum, the initial project included in the synopsis was no longer required, the next \nproject is not planned to commence for over a year, and the agency represents that it currently lacks funding for any of the remaining project requirements.  Under these  \n  Page 6 B-423332  circumstances, we find no basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s decision to cancel the \nsolicitation was unreasonable or improper.   \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the agency\u2019s price realism evaluation and determination that the protester\u2019s price was unrealistic is denied where the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable law and regulation.  \nDECISION  \n Fusion Technology, LLC, of Bridgeport, West Virginia,  protests the issuance of a task \norder to Trilogy Innovations, Inc., of Bridgeport, West Virginia,  under request for \nquotations (RFQ) No. RFQ -09232022, issued by the Department of Justice, Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI),  for digital and information technology services .  The \nprotester primarily challenges the agency\u2019s price realism evaluation and rejection of its \nquotation as unrealistic.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n By way of background, this protest follows several rounds of protests and agency voluntary corrective action over the course of this procurement.  See, e.g.,   \nManTech Advanced Sys. Int\u2019l, Inc. , B-421560.4, Aug. 14, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 210; \nFusion Tech., LLC , B-421560.11, Oct.  7, 2024 (unpublished decision).  On DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  The entire decision has now \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the \nagency issued the RFQ to vendors with a General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contract under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  According to the RFQ, the agency seeks to acquire agile teams, each comprised of three to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the FBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJ IS).  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 (RFQ).\n1  The RFQ \nexplains that an agile team is a \u201ccross -functional group of individuals who define, build, \ntest, and deliver an increment of value,\u201d and that these teams will apply a \u201cScaled Agile Framework \u201d (SAFe), which is \u201can enterprise agility framework that helps organizations \napply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.\u201d  Id.  at 4-5. \n The RFQ seeks to establish five time- and-materials and fixed- price task orders --\ncollectively called \u201cFBI Agility with SAFe Teams\u201d --one for each of five service areas for \nthe FBI\u2019s CJIS.  Each task order is identified by a separate contract line item number  \n(CLIN) --this protest concerns the task order issued under CLIN 3, National Crime \nInformation Center, which was set aside for small businesses.\n2  RFQ  at 5.  The period \nof performance for each task order includes a base period of one year, including a 3-month transition period and 9- month base period, and four 12- month option periods.  \nId. at 16.   \n \nThe RFQ provides for award on a best -value tradeoff basis, applying a three- phase \nadvisory down- selection evaluation approach in which vendors were instructed to \nsubmit certain volumes of their quotations and the agency would evaluate them in each phase under the following factors:  phase one (facility clearance; corporate experience; \nstaffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology demonstration); and phase \nthree (price).\n3  The RFQ advises that:  phase one is more important than phase two; \nphase two is more important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become \n \n1 The agency  has amended the RFQ  thirteen times.  References to the RFQ are to the \nfinal conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All \ncitations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this decision.  \n2 The other CLINs are:  CLIN  1, law enforcement support services; CLIN  2, biometric \nservices; CLIN  4, shared services; and CLIN  5, operational programs.  Two of the \nCLINs are set aside for small businesses, while the other three CLINs are unrestricted.  RFQ  at 10- 12.  Subject to the set -aside conditions, vendors could submit quotations for \nmore than one CLIN.  Id.  at 53.  The agency advises that it has cancelled CLIN  4.  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1 n.1.  \n3 With the exception of the facility clearance factor, which would be rated on a pass\/fail \nbasis, each non- price factor would be evaluated and assigned a confidence rating of \nhigh confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.  RFQ a t 66-67.  Also, in phase \nthree, vendors were instructed to address organizational conflicts of interest, if applicable, provide a key personnel management list,  and address acquisition risk \nquestions.  Id.  at 49.   Page 3 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  more similar in nature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important \nin the best -value tradeoff decision.  Id. at 61.   The RFQ also explains that, at the \nconclusion of phases one and two, the agency would provide vendors with a notice that would advise them whether the agency believed they should proceed to the next phase.   \nThe RFQ notes that the purpose of the advisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id.  at 62-63. \n The price factor in phase three is relevant here.  For the price factor, the RFQ provides:  \n \nThe Government will conduct three separate realism evaluations to determine whether the Quoter\u2019s low price reflects a lack of understanding of contract requirements or risk inherent in the Quoter\u2019s Phase One\u2019s technical solution[.]  In the realism evaluati ons described below, each \nmapped Quoted Rate will be evaluated against the (1) GSA  CALC+ \n[contract awarded labor categories] published rates, (2) historical rates, and (3)  IGCE [independent government cost estimate] rates established \nfor each corresponding Government defined  LCAT [labor category].  If one \nor more of the evaluations are deemed unrealistic, the Quoter\u2019s Price Volume will be deemed unrealistic.  \n Id. at 65. \n The RFQ provides that , in the first evaluation ( \u201cLCAT Pricing Tab\u201d ), the agency would  \n\u201ccompare[] the Quoted Rates to [the] three government data points\u201d --GSA CALC+ rates, \nhistorical rates, and IGCE rates --to assess the realism of rates proposed for each \nLCAT.  Id.   In the second evaluation (\u201cLCAT Instances\u201d), the RFQ provides for \ncomparison of the number of instances of unrealistic rates to the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs).   Id. at 65- 66.  In the third evaluation (\u201cTeam Impact\u201d), the \nRFQ provides for comparison of the number of teams containing unrealistic LCAT rates to the total number of teams quoted.  Id.  at 66.  \n The RFQ emphasizes that, throughout the evaluations, the agency would compare the quoted rates to the three data points noted above--GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates.  Finally, the RFQ provides that, after completing the evaluations, the agency would conduct an \u201cadditional review\u201d of the quotation, including the price and \ntechnical volumes of the quotation, and determine whether the unrealistic aspects reflected a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or unacceptable risk.  Id. \nat 66.  \n In early 2024, the agency received various quotations, including those from Fusion and Trilogy.  The agency evaluated the quotations and selected Trilogy for award on September 6, 2024; thereafter, Fusion filed its first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision.  The agency proposed to take corrective action, to include reevaluating and making a new award decision, and we dismissed that protest as academic.  Fusion Tech., LLC , supra.   Page 4 B-421560.13; B -421560.15   \nThe agency reevaluated the quotations from Fusion and Trilogy4 as follows:  \n \n Fusion  Trilogy  \nCorporate Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nStaffing Approach  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nDemonstration  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nTotal Evaluated Price  $73,618,896  $93,320,721  \nPrice Complete, Reasonable, and \nRealistic  No (Unrealistic)  Yes \n AR, Tab  9, Basis of Award at  9. \n In concluding that Fusion\u2019s quoted price was unrealistic, the agency determined that the quotation included \u201ca total of 13 LCATs that were determined to be unrealistic and nine (9) of the 13 LCATs were determined to be uncorrectable ( i.e., even with a 0 [percent] \ndiscount from the Fully Burdened Rate, Fusion cannot become realistic).\u201d  Id.  at 14; see \nalso AR, Tab 7 -1, Price Report at  9-10; AR, Tab 7- 2, Price Realism Performance Risk \nAssessment at  2.  For these 13 LCATs, Fusion quoted rates that were lower than at \nleast two of the three data points.  See  also COS at  11-14.  The agency further \ndetermined that a total of 25 of the 66 FTEs, and 8 of the 9 teams, would be affected by the unrealistic rates over the period of performance.  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price Report \nat 10-11.  The agency conducted an additional review of Fusion\u2019s quotation and \nconcluded that the risk could not be mitigated.  For example, the agency noted that its strategy to mitigate the risks of using junior level LCATs by pairing them with senior level LCATs, is \u201cnot a viable option for Fusion if both positions are not able to be staffed \nor staffed with under -skilled personnel due to unrealistically low pricing.\u201d  AR, Tab  9, \nBasis of Award at  14; see also AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk \nAssessment at  2 (further noting that \u201c[s]ignificant impact to the CLIN\u2019s velocity and \ncapacity would be expected with Fusion\u2019s solution\u201d).  Based on its overall evaluation, \nthe agency concluded that \u201cFusion\u2019s price quote is unrealistic, reflecting a high -\nperformance risk the Government will not accept.\u201d  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  14.   \n The evaluation authority considered the evaluation, compared the quotations, and documented the award decision.  The evaluation authority summarized the concerns with Fusion\u2019s unrealistic price, highlighting that \u201c[s]ignificant impact to the program\u2019s velocity and capacity are expected based on Fusion\u2019s staffing solution and its solution is deemed high risk.\u201d  Id.   The evaluation authority noted that, while Fusion received \nratings of high confidence under three non- price factors and quoted a lower price, \u201ct he \n \n4 The agency notes that, after numerous protests and corrective actions, Fusion and \nTrilogy were the only two companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  3 task \norder.  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  3.  The agency also notes that both vendors \npassed the facility clearance factor, which, as noted above, was evaluated in phase one \non a pass\/fail basis.  Id.  at 5.  Page 5 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  Government is not willing to accept the risks associated with its unrealistically low -price \nquote and being able to successfully staff the contract.\u201d  Id.   The evaluation authority \nnoted that Trilogy\u2019s quotation also received ratings of high confidence and was \n\u201ccomplete, reasonable, and realistic\u201d; in the evaluation authority\u2019s view, \u201cTrilogy\u2019s highly technically rated solution, with its realistic pricing, is worth the price premium.\u201d  Id.  \n On December 20, the agency again selected Trilogy for award and notified Fusion of its decision.  AR, Tab 10, Unsuccessful Quoter Letter at 1- 2.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  First, Fusion argues that the agency \u201cwrongly concluded [that] Fusion\u2019s LCAT pricing was unrealistically low.\u201d  Protest at  6.  More specifically, Fusion asserts that it was \n\u201cirrational\u201d for the agency to have considered whether Fusion\u2019s quotation \u201cclear[ed]\u201d more than one of the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE \nrates --maintaining that the solicitation should have been interpreted as requiring offerors \nto meet \u201c only one of the three.\u201d  Comments and Supp. Protest at 2; Supp. Comm ents \nat 3.  In this context, Fusion acknowledges that it prepared its quotation by \u201cpicking one\u201d \nof the three benchmarks that it believed each quoted rate would \u201csurpass.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 2- 3.  Accordingly, Fusion asserts that the agency\u2019s price realism  \nevaluation reflected application of unstated evaluation criteria.\n5  Comments and Supp. \nProtest at  4. \n \nAs noted above, the RFQ required the agency to conduct three separate realism \nevaluations to determine whether a vendor\u2019s \u201clow price reflects a lack of understanding \nof contract requirements or risk inherent in\u201d the vendor\u2019s technical solution.  This \nevaluation would include evaluating a firm\u2019s labor rates against three benchmarks --GSA \nCALC+ rates, historical rates, and the IGCE.  RFQ at  65-66.  The agency argues that \n \n5 In its various protest submissions, Fusion has raised arguments that are in addition to, \nor variations of, those specifically discussed below regarding the agency\u2019s price realism \nanalysis.  We have considered all of Fusion\u2019s arguments and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, Fusion also complains that the agency failed to adequately document its price realism analysis.  Fusion acknowledges that the contemporaneous evaluation record includes a table showing each rate Fusion \nquoted, along with the corresponding rates the agency used for each data point, and a calculation of the variance between the quoted rates and the benchmark rates.  Supp. Comments at 2; see, e.g., AR,  Tab 13, IGCE, GSA CALC+, and Historical Rates \nSpreadsheet; AR, Tab  14, Quoted Labor Rates and Evaluation Variance Spreadsheet; \nAR, Tab  15, Unrealistic LCAT Rates, Fusion, Spreadsheet .  While an agency\u2019s \nevaluation judgments in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement must be documented in sufficient detail to show that they are reasonable, section 8.405- 2(f) of the FAR \nestablishes minimum  documentation requirements .  See, e.g., HII Mission Driven \nInnovative Sols., Inc. , B-421221.4, B -421221.5, Apr. 25, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  105 at 7.  \nOn the record here, we reject Fusion\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s price realism evaluation was inadequately documented.   Page 6 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  the solicitation clearly informed offerors that quoted labor rates would be compared to \nall three data points; notes that, if the agency had determined that meeting a single benchmark was sufficient, the RFQ would have so stated; and explains that \u201cutilizi ng \none data point would bring more risk to [contract performance].\u201d  Supp. COS at 2- 3.  \nFurther, the agency notes that, in assessing risk, the agency considered the potential impact the unrealistic rates would have on Fusion\u2019s proposal.  See  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price \nReport at  9-10; AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk Assessment at  2.  In \nshort, the agency maintains that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and it was unreasonable for Fusion to assume that only one of the data points would be considered in the agency\u2019s determination of price realism.  Supp. COS at 2- 3; Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  2. \n As an initial matter, we note that this competition was conducted under the Federal Supply Schedule procedures of FAR subpart 8.4.  The FAR explains that supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices, and services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates or at a fixed- price for performance of a specific task.  \nFAR 8.404(d).  Further, while the procedures of FAR part 15 were not used here, we \nnote that as a general matter, in a fixed- price environment, procuring agencies do not  \nnecessarily have to consider price realism when evaluating quotations because fixed-price vehicles place the risk of loss on the contractor rather than on the government.  Patronus Sys., Inc. , B-418784, B -418784.2, Sept. 3, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  291 at 4; \nLaboratory Corp. of America, B -407108, Nov.  5, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  313 at 5.  However, \nas here, an agency may include in a solicitation a provision that provides for a price realism evaluation for the purpose of assessing whether an offeror\u2019s low price reflects a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or the risk inherent in a proposal.  \nFAR 15.404- 1(d)(3); see also Patronus Sys., Inc. , supra  at 4. \n The FAR identifies a number of  price analysis techniques that may be used to \ndetermine whether prices are reasonable and realistic, including analysis of pricing information provided by vendors .  FAR 15.404- 1(b)(2).  The nature of the analysis \nrequired to assess whether a vendor\u2019s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack \nof technical competence or understanding is  within the agency\u2019s discretion.  AMEC \nEarth & Envtl., Inc., B -404959.2, July 12, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 168 at 8.  Agencies may \nuse a variety of price evaluation methods  to assess realism, including a comparison of \nprices received to one another, to previously proposed or historically paid prices, or to an independent government estimate.  General Dynamics -Ordnance & Tactical Sys. , \nB-401658, B -401658.2, Oct. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 217 at 3.  \n Further, where, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our \nOffice will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable \nand consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 58 \nat 8.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with a procuring agency\u2019s evaluation judgments, \nwithout more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  DEI Consulting , \nB-401258, July 13, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 151 at  2.  When a protester alleges an evaluation  Page 7 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  utilized unstated evaluation criteria, we will assess whether the solicitation reasonably \ninforms vendors of the basis for the evaluation.  Syneren Techs . Corp., B-418541.2, \nB-418541.3, Sept. 25, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  372 at 4.  Procuring agencies need not list \nevery aspect of an evaluation factor so long as the agency\u2019s evaluation is reasonably related to or encompassed by the stated criteria.  Id.  \n Here, Fusion does not meaningfully contest the agency\u2019s determination that a significant number of the labor rates Fusion quoted were below two of the three data points that the solicitation repeatedly stated would be used to assess price realism.  Rather,  Fusion \nasserts that, so long as each quoted rate \u201ccleared\u201d one of the data points, the agency was required to find that labor rate realistic.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  3.  The \nsolicitation, however, did not contain any such requirement.  As noted above, the solicitation simply stated that each quoted rate would be compared to the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates --and further, that the agency \nwould rely on those comparisons and conduct additional review to consider t he impact \non the vendor\u2019s quoted solution.   Because the solicitation did not specify whether a labor rate had to exceed one, two, or three of the benchmarks to be considered realistic, it was for the agency to evaluate the risk posed by labor rates that fell below any of the benchmarks identified by  the \nsolicitation.  As noted above, t he nature of the analysis required to assess whether a \nvendor\u2019s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack of technical competence or \nunderstanding is  within the agency\u2019s discretion, and agencies may use a var iety of price \nevaluation methods to assess realism .  AMEC Earth & Envtl., Inc. , supra at 8; General \nDynamics -Ordnance & Tactical Sys. , supra  at 3.  While Fusion may have preferred an \nevaluation where a labor rate was deemed realistic so long as it exceeded one of the three benchmarks, it has not provided any basis for our Office to conclude that the agency was unreasonable in finding labor rates bel ow two of the three benchmarks \nunrealistic.  At its core, Fusion\u2019s argument amounts to nothing more than disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment.  On this record, Fusion\u2019s protest is without merit, and this protest ground is denied.   Remaining Protest Grounds  \n While Fusion also challenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation under the corporate experience factor,\n6 we need not further address them because, even were it \nto prevail on those grounds, the protester has not established a reasonable possibility of \ncompetitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable \nprotest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, Mar.  31, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 79 at  3. \nOur Office will not sustain a protest unless the protester demonstrates a reasonable \npossibility that it was prejudiced by the agency \u2019s actions; that is, unless the protester \ndemonstrates that, but for the agency \u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial chance \n \n6 Also, Fusion initially raised, and subsequently withdrew, various allegations about the \nagency\u2019s evaluation under the staffing approach factor and potential organizational conflicts of interest.

AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  9.  As also discussed above, \nwe find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Fusion\u2019s price quotation as unrealistic and its conclusion that it was \u201cnot willing to accept the risks associated with [Fusion\u2019s] unrealistically low price quotation and the ability [to] successfully staff the contract.\u201d  MOL at  18, citing  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  14. \n Fusion does not argue that Trilogy should have been eliminated under the corporate experience factor.  Indeed, Fusion acknowledges that the success of its corporate experience evaluation challenges is contingent on the agency also changing its price evaluation--that is, Fusion argues that \u201c[h]ad the Agency properly evaluated Trilogy\u2019s corporate experience, Fusion would have had a decided advantage under the factor, all but ensuring award to Fusion following a remediated price realism evaluation.\u201d  Supp. Com ments at  2, 9; see also Comments and Supp. Protest at 10 n.5 (acknowledging that \nits quotation was \u201cineligible for award because of its unrealistic pricing\u201d).  Under these circumstances, we need not further address Fusion\u2019s challenges to the corporate experience factor because t he protester has not established the necessary competitive \nprejudice.  Specifically, any changes to the corporate experience evaluation as alleged by Fusion would not negate the agency\u2019s conclusion that Fusion\u2019s unrealistic price \npresented risks that were unacceptable to the agency, rendering the quotation ineligible for award.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

See, e.g.,   \nManTech Advanced Sys. Int\u2019l, Inc. , B-421560.4, Aug. 14, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 210; \nFusion Tech., LLC , B-421560.11, Oct.  7, 2024 (unpublished decision).  On DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  The entire decision has now \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the \nagency issued the RFQ to vendors with a General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contract under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  According to the RFQ, the agency seeks to acquire agile teams, each comprised of three to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the FBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJ IS).  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 (RFQ).\n1  The RFQ \nexplains that an agile team is a \u201ccross -functional group of individuals who define, build, \ntest, and deliver an increment of value,\u201d and that these teams will apply a \u201cScaled Agile Framework \u201d (SAFe), which is \u201can enterprise agility framework that helps organizations \napply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.\u201d  Id.  at 4-5. \n The RFQ seeks to establish five time- and-materials and fixed- price task orders --\ncollectively called \u201cFBI Agility with SAFe Teams\u201d --one for each of five service areas for \nthe FBI\u2019s CJIS.  Each task order is identified by a separate contract line item number  \n(CLIN) --this protest concerns the task order issued under CLIN 3, National Crime \nInformation Center, which was set aside for small businesses.\n2  RFQ  at 5.  The period \nof performance for each task order includes a base period of one year, including a 3-month transition period and 9- month base period, and four 12- month option periods.  \nId. at 16.   \n \nThe RFQ provides for award on a best -value tradeoff basis, applying a three- phase \nadvisory down- selection evaluation approach in which vendors were instructed to \nsubmit certain volumes of their quotations and the agency would evaluate them in each phase under the following factors:  phase one (facility clearance; corporate experience; \nstaffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology demonstration); and phase \nthree (price).\n3  The RFQ advises that:  phase one is more important than phase two; \nphase two is more important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become \n \n1 The agency  has amended the RFQ  thirteen times.  References to the RFQ are to the \nfinal conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All \ncitations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this decision.  \n2 The other CLINs are:  CLIN  1, law enforcement support services; CLIN  2, biometric \nservices; CLIN  4, shared services; and CLIN  5, operational programs.  Two of the \nCLINs are set aside for small businesses, while the other three CLINs are unrestricted.  RFQ  at 10- 12.  Subject to the set -aside conditions, vendors could submit quotations for \nmore than one CLIN.  Id.  at 53.  The agency advises that it has cancelled CLIN  4.  \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1 n.1.  \n3 With the exception of the facility clearance factor, which would be rated on a pass\/fail \nbasis, each non- price factor would be evaluated and assigned a confidence rating of \nhigh confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.  RFQ a t 66-67.  Also, in phase \nthree, vendors were instructed to address organizational conflicts of interest, if applicable, provide a key personnel management list,  and address acquisition risk \nquestions.  Id.  at 49.   Page 3 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  more similar in nature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important \nin the best -value tradeoff decision.  Id. at 61.   The RFQ also explains that, at the \nconclusion of phases one and two, the agency would provide vendors with a notice that would advise them whether the agency believed they should proceed to the next phase.   \nThe RFQ notes that the purpose of the advisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id.  at 62-63. \n The price factor in phase three is relevant here.  For the price factor, the RFQ provides:  \n \nThe Government will conduct three separate realism evaluations to determine whether the Quoter\u2019s low price reflects a lack of understanding of contract requirements or risk inherent in the Quoter\u2019s Phase One\u2019s technical solution[.]  In the realism evaluati ons described below, each \nmapped Quoted Rate will be evaluated against the (1) GSA  CALC+ \n[contract awarded labor categories] published rates, (2) historical rates, and (3)  IGCE [independent government cost estimate] rates established \nfor each corresponding Government defined  LCAT [labor category].  If one \nor more of the evaluations are deemed unrealistic, the Quoter\u2019s Price Volume will be deemed unrealistic.  \n Id. at 65. \n The RFQ provides that , in the first evaluation ( \u201cLCAT Pricing Tab\u201d ), the agency would  \n\u201ccompare[] the Quoted Rates to [the] three government data points\u201d --GSA CALC+ rates, \nhistorical rates, and IGCE rates --to assess the realism of rates proposed for each \nLCAT.  Id.   In the second evaluation (\u201cLCAT Instances\u201d), the RFQ provides for \ncomparison of the number of instances of unrealistic rates to the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs).   Id. at 65- 66.  In the third evaluation (\u201cTeam Impact\u201d), the \nRFQ provides for comparison of the number of teams containing unrealistic LCAT rates to the total number of teams quoted.  Id.  at 66.  \n The RFQ emphasizes that, throughout the evaluations, the agency would compare the quoted rates to the three data points noted above--GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates.  Finally, the RFQ provides that, after completing the evaluations, the agency would conduct an \u201cadditional review\u201d of the quotation, including the price and \ntechnical volumes of the quotation, and determine whether the unrealistic aspects reflected a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or unacceptable risk.  Id. \nat 66.  \n In early 2024, the agency received various quotations, including those from Fusion and Trilogy.  The agency evaluated the quotations and selected Trilogy for award on September 6, 2024; thereafter, Fusion filed its first protest with our Office, challenging various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision.  The agency proposed to take corrective action, to include reevaluating and making a new award decision, and we dismissed that protest as academic.  Fusion Tech., LLC , supra.   Page 4 B-421560.13; B -421560.15   \nThe agency reevaluated the quotations from Fusion and Trilogy4 as follows:  \n \n Fusion  Trilogy  \nCorporate Experience  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nStaffing Approach  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nDemonstration  High Confidence  High Confidence  \nTotal Evaluated Price  $73,618,896  $93,320,721  \nPrice Complete, Reasonable, and \nRealistic  No (Unrealistic)  Yes \n AR, Tab  9, Basis of Award at  9. \n In concluding that Fusion\u2019s quoted price was unrealistic, the agency determined that the quotation included \u201ca total of 13 LCATs that were determined to be unrealistic and nine (9) of the 13 LCATs were determined to be uncorrectable ( i.e., even with a 0 [percent] \ndiscount from the Fully Burdened Rate, Fusion cannot become realistic).\u201d  Id.  at 14; see \nalso AR, Tab 7 -1, Price Report at  9-10; AR, Tab 7- 2, Price Realism Performance Risk \nAssessment at  2.  For these 13 LCATs, Fusion quoted rates that were lower than at \nleast two of the three data points.  See  also COS at  11-14.  The agency further \ndetermined that a total of 25 of the 66 FTEs, and 8 of the 9 teams, would be affected by the unrealistic rates over the period of performance.  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price Report \nat 10-11.  The agency conducted an additional review of Fusion\u2019s quotation and \nconcluded that the risk could not be mitigated.  For example, the agency noted that its strategy to mitigate the risks of using junior level LCATs by pairing them with senior level LCATs, is \u201cnot a viable option for Fusion if both positions are not able to be staffed \nor staffed with under -skilled personnel due to unrealistically low pricing.\u201d  AR, Tab  9, \nBasis of Award at  14; see also AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk \nAssessment at  2 (further noting that \u201c[s]ignificant impact to the CLIN\u2019s velocity and \ncapacity would be expected with Fusion\u2019s solution\u201d).  Based on its overall evaluation, \nthe agency concluded that \u201cFusion\u2019s price quote is unrealistic, reflecting a high -\nperformance risk the Government will not accept.\u201d  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  14.   \n The evaluation authority considered the evaluation, compared the quotations, and documented the award decision.  The evaluation authority summarized the concerns with Fusion\u2019s unrealistic price, highlighting that \u201c[s]ignificant impact to the program\u2019s velocity and capacity are expected based on Fusion\u2019s staffing solution and its solution is deemed high risk.\u201d  Id.   The evaluation authority noted that, while Fusion received \nratings of high confidence under three non- price factors and quoted a lower price, \u201ct he \n \n4 The agency notes that, after numerous protests and corrective actions, Fusion and \nTrilogy were the only two companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  3 task \norder.  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  3.  The agency also notes that both vendors \npassed the facility clearance factor, which, as noted above, was evaluated in phase one \non a pass\/fail basis.  Id.  at 5.  Page 5 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  Government is not willing to accept the risks associated with its unrealistically low -price \nquote and being able to successfully staff the contract.\u201d  Id.   The evaluation authority \nnoted that Trilogy\u2019s quotation also received ratings of high confidence and was \n\u201ccomplete, reasonable, and realistic\u201d; in the evaluation authority\u2019s view, \u201cTrilogy\u2019s highly technically rated solution, with its realistic pricing, is worth the price premium.\u201d  Id.  \n On December 20, the agency again selected Trilogy for award and notified Fusion of its decision.  AR, Tab 10, Unsuccessful Quoter Letter at 1- 2.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  First, Fusion argues that the agency \u201cwrongly concluded [that] Fusion\u2019s LCAT pricing was unrealistically low.\u201d  Protest at  6.  More specifically, Fusion asserts that it was \n\u201cirrational\u201d for the agency to have considered whether Fusion\u2019s quotation \u201cclear[ed]\u201d more than one of the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE \nrates --maintaining that the solicitation should have been interpreted as requiring offerors \nto meet \u201c only one of the three.\u201d  Comments and Supp. Protest at 2; Supp. Comm ents \nat 3.  In this context, Fusion acknowledges that it prepared its quotation by \u201cpicking one\u201d \nof the three benchmarks that it believed each quoted rate would \u201csurpass.\u201d  Supp. Comments at 2- 3.  Accordingly, Fusion asserts that the agency\u2019s price realism  \nevaluation reflected application of unstated evaluation criteria.\n5  Comments and Supp. \nProtest at  4. \n \nAs noted above, the RFQ required the agency to conduct three separate realism \nevaluations to determine whether a vendor\u2019s \u201clow price reflects a lack of understanding \nof contract requirements or risk inherent in\u201d the vendor\u2019s technical solution.  This \nevaluation would include evaluating a firm\u2019s labor rates against three benchmarks --GSA \nCALC+ rates, historical rates, and the IGCE.  RFQ at  65-66.  The agency argues that \n \n5 In its various protest submissions, Fusion has raised arguments that are in addition to, \nor variations of, those specifically discussed below regarding the agency\u2019s price realism \nanalysis.  We have considered all of Fusion\u2019s arguments and find that they afford no basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, Fusion also complains that the agency failed to adequately document its price realism analysis.  Fusion acknowledges that the contemporaneous evaluation record includes a table showing each rate Fusion \nquoted, along with the corresponding rates the agency used for each data point, and a calculation of the variance between the quoted rates and the benchmark rates.  Supp. Comments at 2; see, e.g., AR,  Tab 13, IGCE, GSA CALC+, and Historical Rates \nSpreadsheet; AR, Tab  14, Quoted Labor Rates and Evaluation Variance Spreadsheet; \nAR, Tab  15, Unrealistic LCAT Rates, Fusion, Spreadsheet .  While an agency\u2019s \nevaluation judgments in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement must be documented in sufficient detail to show that they are reasonable, section 8.405- 2(f) of the FAR \nestablishes minimum  documentation requirements .  See, e.g., HII Mission Driven \nInnovative Sols., Inc. , B-421221.4, B -421221.5, Apr. 25, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  105 at 7.  \nOn the record here, we reject Fusion\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s price realism evaluation was inadequately documented.   Page 6 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  the solicitation clearly informed offerors that quoted labor rates would be compared to \nall three data points; notes that, if the agency had determined that meeting a single benchmark was sufficient, the RFQ would have so stated; and explains that \u201cutilizi ng \none data point would bring more risk to [contract performance].\u201d  Supp. COS at 2- 3.  \nFurther, the agency notes that, in assessing risk, the agency considered the potential impact the unrealistic rates would have on Fusion\u2019s proposal.  See  AR, Tab 7- 1, Price \nReport at  9-10; AR, Tab  7-2, Price Realism Performance Risk Assessment at  2.  In \nshort, the agency maintains that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation, and it was unreasonable for Fusion to assume that only one of the data points would be considered in the agency\u2019s determination of price realism.  Supp. COS at 2- 3; Supp. Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  2. \n As an initial matter, we note that this competition was conducted under the Federal Supply Schedule procedures of FAR subpart 8.4.  The FAR explains that supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices, and services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates or at a fixed- price for performance of a specific task.  \nFAR 8.404(d).  Further, while the procedures of FAR part 15 were not used here, we \nnote that as a general matter, in a fixed- price environment, procuring agencies do not  \nnecessarily have to consider price realism when evaluating quotations because fixed-price vehicles place the risk of loss on the contractor rather than on the government.  Patronus Sys., Inc. , B-418784, B -418784.2, Sept. 3, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  291 at 4; \nLaboratory Corp. of America, B -407108, Nov.  5, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  313 at 5.  However, \nas here, an agency may include in a solicitation a provision that provides for a price realism evaluation for the purpose of assessing whether an offeror\u2019s low price reflects a lack of understanding of the contract requirements or the risk inherent in a proposal.  \nFAR 15.404- 1(d)(3); see also Patronus Sys., Inc. , supra  at 4. \n The FAR identifies a number of  price analysis techniques that may be used to \ndetermine whether prices are reasonable and realistic, including analysis of pricing information provided by vendors .  FAR 15.404- 1(b)(2).  The nature of the analysis \nrequired to assess whether a vendor\u2019s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack \nof technical competence or understanding is  within the agency\u2019s discretion.  AMEC \nEarth & Envtl., Inc., B -404959.2, July 12, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 168 at 8.  Agencies may \nuse a variety of price evaluation methods  to assess realism, including a comparison of \nprices received to one another, to previously proposed or historically paid prices, or to an independent government estimate.  General Dynamics -Ordnance & Tactical Sys. , \nB-401658, B -401658.2, Oct. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 217 at 3.  \n Further, where, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our \nOffice will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable \nand consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 58 \nat 8.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with a procuring agency\u2019s evaluation judgments, \nwithout more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  DEI Consulting , \nB-401258, July 13, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 151 at  2.  When a protester alleges an evaluation  Page 7 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  utilized unstated evaluation criteria, we will assess whether the solicitation reasonably \ninforms vendors of the basis for the evaluation.  Syneren Techs . Corp., B-418541.2, \nB-418541.3, Sept. 25, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  372 at 4.  Procuring agencies need not list \nevery aspect of an evaluation factor so long as the agency\u2019s evaluation is reasonably related to or encompassed by the stated criteria.  Id.  \n Here, Fusion does not meaningfully contest the agency\u2019s determination that a significant number of the labor rates Fusion quoted were below two of the three data points that the solicitation repeatedly stated would be used to assess price realism.  Rather,  Fusion \nasserts that, so long as each quoted rate \u201ccleared\u201d one of the data points, the agency was required to find that labor rate realistic.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  3.  The \nsolicitation, however, did not contain any such requirement.  As noted above, the solicitation simply stated that each quoted rate would be compared to the three data points --GSA CALC+ rates, historical rates, and IGCE rates --and further, that the agency \nwould rely on those comparisons and conduct additional review to consider t he impact \non the vendor\u2019s quoted solution.   Because the solicitation did not specify whether a labor rate had to exceed one, two, or three of the benchmarks to be considered realistic, it was for the agency to evaluate the risk posed by labor rates that fell below any of the benchmarks identified by  the \nsolicitation.  As noted above, t he nature of the analysis required to assess whether a \nvendor\u2019s  price is so unrealistically low as to reflect a lack of technical competence or \nunderstanding is  within the agency\u2019s discretion, and agencies may use a var iety of price \nevaluation methods to assess realism .  AMEC Earth & Envtl., Inc. , supra at 8; General \nDynamics -Ordnance & Tactical Sys. , supra  at 3.  While Fusion may have preferred an \nevaluation where a labor rate was deemed realistic so long as it exceeded one of the three benchmarks, it has not provided any basis for our Office to conclude that the agency was unreasonable in finding labor rates bel ow two of the three benchmarks \nunrealistic.  At its core, Fusion\u2019s argument amounts to nothing more than disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment.  On this record, Fusion\u2019s protest is without merit, and this protest ground is denied.   Remaining Protest Grounds  \n While Fusion also challenges various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation under the corporate experience factor,\n6 we need not further address them because, even were it \nto prevail on those grounds, the protester has not established a reasonable possibility of \ncompetitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable \nprotest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, Mar.  31, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 79 at  3. \nOur Office will not sustain a protest unless the protester demonstrates a reasonable \npossibility that it was prejudiced by the agency \u2019s actions; that is, unless the protester \ndemonstrates that, but for the agency \u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial chance \n \n6 Also, Fusion initially raised, and subsequently withdrew, various allegations about the \nagency\u2019s evaluation under the staffing approach factor and potential organizational conflicts of interest.  Protest at  10-14; Comments and Supp. Protest at  2 n.2.   Page 8 B-421560.13; B -421560.15  of receiving the award.  CSI Aviation, Inc. , B-415631 et al. , Feb.  7, 2018, 2018 CPD \n\u00b6 68 at  7; see, e.g., Sabreliner Corp. , B-284240.2, B -284240.6, Mar. 22, 2000, 2000 \nCPD \u00b6 68 at  10 (finding no competitive prejudice from allegations about evaluation of \ntechnical strengths where agency reasonably determined that protester\u2019s unrealistic \nprice precluded award to the protester).  \n As noted above, Fusion and Trilogy each received ratings of high confidence under the corporate experience factor.  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  9.  As also discussed above, \nwe find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Fusion\u2019s price quotation as unrealistic and its conclusion that it was \u201cnot willing to accept the risks associated with [Fusion\u2019s] unrealistically low price quotation and the ability [to] successfully staff the contract.\u201d  MOL at  18, citing  AR, Tab 9, Basis of Award at  14. \n Fusion does not argue that Trilogy should have been eliminated under the corporate experience factor.  Indeed, Fusion acknowledges that the success of its corporate experience evaluation challenges is contingent on the agency also changing its price evaluation--that is, Fusion argues that \u201c[h]ad the Agency properly evaluated Trilogy\u2019s corporate experience, Fusion would have had a decided advantage under the factor, all but ensuring award to Fusion following a remediated price realism evaluation.\u201d  Supp. Com ments at  2, 9; see also Comments and Supp. Protest at 10 n.5 (acknowledging that \nits quotation was \u201cineligible for award because of its unrealistic pricing\u201d).  Under these circumstances, we need not further address Fusion\u2019s challenges to the corporate experience factor because t he protester has not established the necessary competitive \nprejudice.  Specifically, any changes to the corporate experience evaluation as alleged by Fusion would not negate the agency\u2019s conclusion that Fusion\u2019s unrealistic price \npresented risks that were unacceptable to the agency, rendering the quotation ineligible for award.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n "

        "Summary":"Protest challenging agency\u2019s issuance of a sole- source purchase order using simplified \nacquisition procedures is denied where the record shows that the agency reasonably determined that there was only one source available to meet the agency\u2019s urgent requirements for first responder medical training prior to military troop deployment .   \nDECISION  \n Assessment and Training Solutions Consulting Corporation (ATSCC) , a service-\ndisabled veteran- owned small business located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, protests the \nissuance of a sole -source fixed -price purchase order to Tactical Electronics and Military \nSupply, LLC  (Tactical Electronics ), of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma,  by the Department of \nthe Navy  to provide tactical first responder medical training prior to military troop \ndeployment.   ATSCC argues that the agency\u2019s sole- source award is unreasonable and \ncontrary to applicable procurement law and regulation.  \n We deny the protest.    \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe Navy\u2019s Expeditionary Exploitation Unit -1 (EXU- 1) has a requirement to provide \ntactical first responder medical training (hereinafter , medical training) to military \npersonnel  operating in various scenarios to include battlefield, remote care, prolonged \ntransport, or unique rescue conditions .  The medical training encompasses  the \ntreatment of the trauma\/casualty  patient with particular emphasis on penetrating, blunt, \nand blast trauma in conjunction with environmental and situational concerns.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 3, Statement of  Page 2 B-423398  Work (SOW) at 1.1  The medical training simulate s a hostile environment where \nstudents must perform frontline first aid procedures of medical care, the different phases \nof medical care, and triage as they relate to medical care on the battlefield after \nneutralizing the enemy threat.  Among other things, the successful contractor will be \nrequired to equip, train, and certify explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) platoons in \nadvance lifesaving skills and techniques used in remote hostile environments without immediate evacuation support.  SOW at 1.   \n To procure these services, t he agency  originally anticipated issuing a solicitation under \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 13.5 , simplified acquisition procedures , \nunder which the agency would issue a firm-fixed -price purchase order .  COS at 1.  The \nSOW  accompanying the agency\u2019s December 2024 request for market research \ninformation anticipated a base performance period of  March  24-26, 2025, with three \noption periods.  SOW at 4.    \n As is r elevant , the agency represents that during the first quarter of the current fiscal \nyear a solicitation could not be issued because current year appropriated funding was \nnot available.  The agency explains that it was operating under continuing resolution \nauthority (CRA) that would not be lifted until March 14, 2025,  which would delay \nexecution of a purchase order for the medical training scheduled to begin on March 24.  \nCOS at  1-2.  Given the importance of this training for military personnel with im pending \ndeployments , the agency identified strategies to address the situation, including utiliz ing \nexisting Defense Logistics Agency contracts or the purchase card payment method,\n2 \nconcluding that  neither option was appropriate given the terms and conditions of the \nrequired training .  Id. at 2.   \n While waiting on the availability of funds either through a new CRA or congressional \nappropriation, the contracting officer decided to initiate market research and complete \nall preliminary procurement actions to ensure readiness once funding was appropriated.  \nId.

T he contracting officer concluded that the only way to \nobtain the required training prior to military deployment was to issue a sole-source \nactio n based on urgent justification under FAR section 13.106- 1(b)(1)(i).  The \ncontracting officer did not issue a solicitation.   Id.   \n As is relevant , the urgent justification explained as follows:   \n \nIf EXU- 1 is not able to provide this training requirement, [this] will cause \nissues with rotating military personnel to complete this training and prevent from being able to complete mission requirements.  This would also cause a ripple effect of delaying incoming military personnel to receive training before they report out for mission requirements.

The protester also alleges that the sole- source justification was \nprocedurally and legally defective since the agency was still pursuing competition up to \nand through finalization of the sole -source justification.  Id. at 2-3.  For the reasons that \nfollow, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.\n5 \n \nAs an initial matter , we find no merit to ATSCC\u2019s allegation that the agency\u2019s conduct  \nestablished a competitive RFQ .  The record shows that while the agency \nrepresentative\u2019s emailed request s for market research information used the term \n\u201cquote,\u201d  the email communications unequivocally stated that the representative wa s not \na contracting officer and that all contracts and delivery orders w ould be negotiated by a \ngovernment contracting officer.  See  e.g., AR, Exh. 2, Req. for Market Research Quote \nfor EOD First Responder Medical Suite Training 20241210 (Dec. 10, 2024) .  The record \nalso shows that in responding to a question posed by the protester,  the agency \nrepresentative specifically stated that any information provided by the vendor would be \nused only for market research and that any subsequent procurement action would be \nundertaken by the contracting officer.  Id., Email Communication to ATSCC (Jan. 15, \n2025).   \n \nIn any event, the agency asserts that only the contracting officer has the authority to \nissue solicitations to solicit formal proposals or quotations.  In this regard, had the \ncontracting officer intended to issue an RFQ, the agency asserts that the RFQ would \nhave included  all relevant solicitation provisions , such as, section B: supplies or \nservices; section F:  deliveries or p erformance; section L:  instructions, conditions , and \nnotices to o fferors; and section M:  evaluation factors for a ward ; to permit vendors to \n \n5 ATSCC raises other collateral arguments.  While our decision does not specifically \naddress each of the argument s, we have reviewed all of the arguments and find that \nnone provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.    Page 6 B-423398  prepare and submit responsive proposals or quotations .  The agency maintains that no \nsuch solicitation was issued by the contracting officer.  See MOL at  6.   \n \nBased on the record presented, we find no support for the protester\u2019s allegation that the \nagency\u2019s email communications should be construed as  an RFQ .  Nor was the agency \nrequired to evaluate the protester\u2019s February 20 market research submission,  which \nATSCC characterizes as a responsive lower -priced quotation.  Accordingly, w e deny \nthis aspect of the protest.   \n ATSCC also contends that the agency\u2019s decision to issue a sole- source purchase order \nusing the urgency justification of FAR section 13.106- 1(b)(1)(i)  to Tactical Electronics \nwas improper  and inconsistent with the competition requirements of the simplified \nacquisition procedures of FAR p art 13.  According to the protester, there was more than \none source reasonably available to perform the medical training requirements since the \nagency  had received an eligible and cost -effective quotation from ATSCC, another  \nknown, reliable vendor.  See  Comments at 2- 3.   \n When conducting a procurement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, contracting officers must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies \nand services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the government.  41 U.S.C. \u00a7 3305(d); FAR 13.104; see also Information Ventures, Inc. , B-293541,  \nApr. 9, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 81 at 3.  As an exception to the general competition \nrequirement s, for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a \ncontracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that \nthe circumstances of the contract action deem only one source r easonably available \n(e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand- name or industrial mobilization).  \nFAR 13.106- 1(b).  We review an agency\u2019s decision to limit competition under such \ncircumstances for reasonableness.  Summit Techs., Inc. , B-419126, B-419126.2,  \nNov. 19, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  384 at 4; Critical Process Filtration, Inc. , B-400746 et al. , \nJan. 22, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 25 at 5.    \n Here, based on our review of the record discussed above, we reject ATSCC\u2019s \nassertions that the Navy has failed to provide a reasonable justification for its conclusion that only one source was reasonably available to provide the medical training \nrequirements prior to the deployment of military troops.  As discussed above, the record \nreflects the Navy\u2019s:  well documented recognition of problems associated with the lack of current year available funding; consideration of other strategies to meet its needs;  the \nneed to ensure troop safety by providing medical training prior to deployment; and,  \nbased on market research, the availability of only one source capable of meeting the \nagency\u2019s needs .  More specifically, the record demonstrates that once the medical \ntraining was elevated to a mission critical requirement, the operational risks associated with a delay in awa rding the purchase order  would have prevented this missi on critical \nmedical training from occurring prior to troop deployment .  The record further \ndemonstrates that the Navy reasonably attempted to conduct market research well in advance of its anticipated requirement.  The agency reasonably determined that only one source could satisfy its urgent requirements based on the single t imely response to  Page 7 B-423398  its December 2024 request for market research, and the protester provides no \nreasonable justification for its delay until late February 2025 in providing responsive \ninformation to the agency\u2019s market research request.  \n \nA contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them.  See Ho-olaulima Gov\u2019t Sols., LLC , B-421958, B -421958.2,  \nDec. 19, 2023, 2024 CPD \u00b6 10 at 7.  ATSCC\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s needs \nand how to best accommodate them, without more, does not show that the agency\u2019s judgment is unreasonable.  Id.; see also, SSI Tech., Inc ., B-417917, Dec. 4, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 418 at 7.  Accordingly, on this record, we find that the Navy has \ndemonstrated a reasonable bas is for issuing the sole- source purchase order to Tactical \nElectronics based on an urgent justification .\n6   \n The protest is denied.

ATSCC argues that the agency\u2019s sole- source award is unreasonable and \ncontrary to applicable procurement law and regulation.  \n We deny the protest.    \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe Navy\u2019s Expeditionary Exploitation Unit -1 (EXU- 1) has a requirement to provide \ntactical first responder medical training (hereinafter , medical training) to military \npersonnel  operating in various scenarios to include battlefield, remote care, prolonged \ntransport, or unique rescue conditions .  The medical training encompasses  the \ntreatment of the trauma\/casualty  patient with particular emphasis on penetrating, blunt, \nand blast trauma in conjunction with environmental and situational concerns.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 3, Statement of  Page 2 B-423398  Work (SOW) at 1.1  The medical training simulate s a hostile environment where \nstudents must perform frontline first aid procedures of medical care, the different phases \nof medical care, and triage as they relate to medical care on the battlefield after \nneutralizing the enemy threat.  Among other things, the successful contractor will be \nrequired to equip, train, and certify explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) platoons in \nadvance lifesaving skills and techniques used in remote hostile environments without immediate evacuation support.  SOW at 1.   \n To procure these services, t he agency  originally anticipated issuing a solicitation under \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 13.5 , simplified acquisition procedures , \nunder which the agency would issue a firm-fixed -price purchase order .  COS at 1.  The \nSOW  accompanying the agency\u2019s December 2024 request for market research \ninformation anticipated a base performance period of  March  24-26, 2025, with three \noption periods.  SOW at 4.    \n As is r elevant , the agency represents that during the first quarter of the current fiscal \nyear a solicitation could not be issued because current year appropriated funding was \nnot available.  The agency explains that it was operating under continuing resolution \nauthority (CRA) that would not be lifted until March 14, 2025,  which would delay \nexecution of a purchase order for the medical training scheduled to begin on March 24.  \nCOS at  1-2.  Given the importance of this training for military personnel with im pending \ndeployments , the agency identified strategies to address the situation, including utiliz ing \nexisting Defense Logistics Agency contracts or the purchase card payment method,\n2 \nconcluding that  neither option was appropriate given the terms and conditions of the \nrequired training .  Id. at 2.   \n While waiting on the availability of funds either through a new CRA or congressional \nappropriation, the contracting officer decided to initiate market research and complete \nall preliminary procurement actions to ensure readiness once funding was appropriated.  \nId.  In conducting its market research, an agency representati ve engaged in an email \nexchange with three vendors, including the protester and the awardee, that was labeled \nas a \u201crequest for market research quote.\u201d   AR, Exh. 2, Req. for Market Research Quote \nfor EOD First Responder Medical Suite Training 20241210 (Dec. 10, 2024).\n3  The \n \n1 Citations to the record use the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents provided \nby the parties.   \n2 The governmentwide commercial purchase card may be used to:  (1) make micro-\npurchases; (2) place a task or delivery order (if authorized in the basic contract, basic \nordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement); or (3) make payments  when the \ncontractor agrees to accept payment by the card.

For the reasons that \nfollow, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.\n5 \n \nAs an initial matter , we find no merit to ATSCC\u2019s allegation that the agency\u2019s conduct  \nestablished a competitive RFQ .  The record shows that while the agency \nrepresentative\u2019s emailed request s for market research information used the term \n\u201cquote,\u201d  the email communications unequivocally stated that the representative wa s not \na contracting officer and that all contracts and delivery orders w ould be negotiated by a \ngovernment contracting officer.  See  e.g., AR, Exh. 2, Req. for Market Research Quote \nfor EOD First Responder Medical Suite Training 20241210 (Dec. 10, 2024) .  The record \nalso shows that in responding to a question posed by the protester,  the agency \nrepresentative specifically stated that any information provided by the vendor would be \nused only for market research and that any subsequent procurement action would be \nundertaken by the contracting officer.  Id., Email Communication to ATSCC (Jan. 15, \n2025).   \n \nIn any event, the agency asserts that only the contracting officer has the authority to \nissue solicitations to solicit formal proposals or quotations.  In this regard, had the \ncontracting officer intended to issue an RFQ, the agency asserts that the RFQ would \nhave included  all relevant solicitation provisions , such as, section B: supplies or \nservices; section F:  deliveries or p erformance; section L:  instructions, conditions , and \nnotices to o fferors; and section M:  evaluation factors for a ward ; to permit vendors to \n \n5 ATSCC raises other collateral arguments.  While our decision does not specifically \naddress each of the argument s, we have reviewed all of the arguments and find that \nnone provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.    Page 6 B-423398  prepare and submit responsive proposals or quotations .  The agency maintains that no \nsuch solicitation was issued by the contracting officer.  See MOL at  6.   \n \nBased on the record presented, we find no support for the protester\u2019s allegation that the \nagency\u2019s email communications should be construed as  an RFQ .  Nor was the agency \nrequired to evaluate the protester\u2019s February 20 market research submission,  which \nATSCC characterizes as a responsive lower -priced quotation.  Accordingly, w e deny \nthis aspect of the protest.   \n ATSCC also contends that the agency\u2019s decision to issue a sole- source purchase order \nusing the urgency justification of FAR section 13.106- 1(b)(1)(i)  to Tactical Electronics \nwas improper  and inconsistent with the competition requirements of the simplified \nacquisition procedures of FAR p art 13.  According to the protester, there was more than \none source reasonably available to perform the medical training requirements since the \nagency  had received an eligible and cost -effective quotation from ATSCC, another  \nknown, reliable vendor.  See  Comments at 2- 3.   \n When conducting a procurement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, contracting officers must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies \nand services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the government.  41 U.S.C. \u00a7 3305(d); FAR 13.104; see also Information Ventures, Inc. , B-293541,  \nApr. 9, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 81 at 3.  As an exception to the general competition \nrequirement s, for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, a \ncontracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that \nthe circumstances of the contract action deem only one source r easonably available \n(e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand- name or industrial mobilization).  \nFAR 13.106- 1(b).  We review an agency\u2019s decision to limit competition under such \ncircumstances for reasonableness.

As discussed above, the record \nreflects the Navy\u2019s:  well documented recognition of problems associated with the lack of current year available funding; consideration of other strategies to meet its needs;  the \nneed to ensure troop safety by providing medical training prior to deployment; and,  \nbased on market research, the availability of only one source capable of meeting the \nagency\u2019s needs .  More specifically, the record demonstrates that once the medical \ntraining was elevated to a mission critical requirement, the operational risks associated with a delay in awa rding the purchase order  would have prevented this missi on critical \nmedical training from occurring prior to troop deployment .  The record further \ndemonstrates that the Navy reasonably attempted to conduct market research well in advance of its anticipated requirement.  The agency reasonably determined that only one source could satisfy its urgent requirements based on the single t imely response to  Page 7 B-423398  its December 2024 request for market research, and the protester provides no \nreasonable justification for its delay until late February 2025 in providing responsive \ninformation to the agency\u2019s market research request.  \n \nA contracting agency has the discretion to determine its needs and the best method to accommodate them.  See Ho-olaulima Gov\u2019t Sols., LLC , B-421958, B -421958.2,  \nDec. 19, 2023, 2024 CPD \u00b6 10 at 7.  ATSCC\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s needs \nand how to best accommodate them, without more, does not show that the agency\u2019s judgment is unreasonable.  Id.; see also, SSI Tech., Inc ., B-417917, Dec. 4, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 418 at 7.  Accordingly, on this record, we find that the Navy has \ndemonstrated a reasonable bas is for issuing the sole- source purchase order to Tactical \nElectronics based on an urgent justification .\n6   \n The protest is denied.    Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n6 The agency raised concerns with the accuracy of citations to prior GAO decisions \ncontained in the protester\u2019s filings, noting that in some instances the cited cases did not appear to exist or, to the extent the citations were valid, they did not stand for the factual \nor legal positions asserted.  See 2nd Req. for Dismissal at 2- 3, Apr. 2, 2025.

        "Summary":"Protest that agency failed to properly consider protester \u2019s price and unreasonably \nissued Federal Supply Schedule order to higher -priced vendor is denied where the \nrecord shows the agency \u2019s source selection decision reasonably determined that \nsuccessful vendor \u2019s quotation provided the best value under the solicitation criteria.    \nDECISION  \n GENCO Systems, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, a small business, protests the General \nServices Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service \u2019s issuance of a task order \nunder a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) to Jay \nShapiro & Associates, Inc ., of Far Hills, New Jersey .  The agency issued the task order \nunder request for quotations (RFQ) No. 47PC0224Q0020, for c onstruction management \nservices  at the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Office Building in Jamaica, New York.  \nGENCO argues that GSA improperly selected Jay Shapiro\u2019s quotation over GENCO \u2019s \nlower -priced quotation.   \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n GSA issued the RFQ to firms hold ing FSS multiple -award national BPAs  for \nconstruction management services, program\/project management services, and  Page 2 B-423304  building\/lease inspection services --zone 1.1  The RFQ itself (labeled as an \u201cinstruction \nto offeror\u201d ) stated that the agency intended to issue a fixed- priced task order to the \nvendor whose quotation provided the best value, which would be determined by \u201c a \ntradeoff between non- cost factors and cost\/price. \u201d  RFQ at 2.  GSA states that the \nprocurement was conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \nsection 8.405- 3, the provisions of which describe the issuance of BPAs and the process \nfor ordering under them.  Memorandum of L aw (MOL ) at 1.  The RFQ listed three \nfactors and their weighting:  staffing plan (30 percent), project management plan (30 \npercent) and price (40 percent).  Id.  at 2-3.  The project management plan factor was \ndivided into two equally weighted subfactors :  quality assurance plan (15 percent) and \nprogram management plan (15 percent).  Id. at 3.   \n \nThe statement of work (SOW) for  the RFQ described the required staffing as :  \none (1) Off hours\/Night Time Construction Inspector dedicated to providing Off hours and night time inspection services for all ongoing construction projects, one (1) Senior Project Manager \/ Team Leader, two (2) Senior Construction Managers with mechanical and electrical \nexperience, Senior Commissioning Agent, Commissioning Agent and a Commissioning Specialist or equivalent contract labor categories.  \nProtest exh. 1, SOW at 4 .\n2 \n Under the heading of hours worked, the SOW further specified:  \n \nThe contractor \u2019s onsite CM [construction management] staff (onsite CM \nstaff includes one (1) Off  hours\/Night time inspector \u2013  who shall be onsite \nfor 40 hours a week during off hours to include night time to perform construction phase inspection services, a work schedule shall be submitted on weekly basis for GSA approval, this work schedule shall be created based on the construction schedule of all ongoing projects [)].   \n Id. at 2.   \n Two vendors submitted quotations:  GENCO , the incumbent contractor , and Jay \nShapiro .\n3  The evaluation used point scores to indicate the merit of each quotation \n \n1 The term \u201czone 1\u201d appears to have been used during the competition for the \nunderlying FSS BPAs to describe their  geographic scope, which covered multiple GSA \nPublic Buildings Service regions.  The RFQ indicates that the Addabbo building is in \nGSA Public Buildings Service region No. 2.  Protest exh. 2, RFQ at 1.   \n2 GENCO explains, and GSA does not dispute, that this amounted to four full -time \npositions (one the off hours\/night  time position) and three part -time positions.    \n3 The record contains a brief reference to a third vendor  and indicates that its quotation \nwas ineligible for award.   MOL at 10.   Accordingly , we do not discuss it further.    Page 3 B-423304  under each factor and subfactor, which included assessing a score for the price factor.   \nAs relevant here, the evaluation concluded that GENCO \u2019s quotation had what the \nagency refers to as \u201cdeficienc ies\u201d4 regarding the firm \u2019s approach to escalation of issues, \nits project planning, and its staffing of the off -hours\/nighttime construction inspector \nposition.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  3.   \n \nAfter completing the evaluati on, GSA issued the task order to Jay Shapiro.  GENCO \nrequested a brief explanation and then filed an agency -level protest  challenging GSA \u2019s \nevaluation of the firm \u2019s quotation and the decision to award the order at a higher price \nas unreasonable and inconsistent with the RFQ .  GSA sustained GENCO \u2019s protest in \npart, finding that the agency  had improperly weighted the price factor in making the \nbest-value determination, and directed the contracting officer to properly weight the \nprice factor and make a new source selection decision.  AR, Tab 1, Decision on First \nAgency -Level Protest at  12-13.  The agency denied GENCO \u2019s remaining challenges.    \n GSA revised the price evaluation and recalculated both firms \u2019 evaluated scores.  To \nimplement the agency -level protest decision, the agency used a revised price evaluation \nscheme that assigned scores to offerors \u2019 total prices on the following basis:  a pric e \nmore than 15 percent below the agency \u2019s estimate would receive the maximum \nweighted score of 40 points; a price below the estimate by less than 15 percent would receive 30 points; a price equal to or above the estimate by up to 15 percent would receive 20 points; and a price more than 15 percent above the estimate would be \nunacceptable and receive no points.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  2.  \nGENCO \u2019s total evaluated price of $5,570,984 received a price score of 40 points, while \nJay Shapiro\u2019 s price of $6,622,600.80 received 30 points.  Id. at 3.  The recalculation \nresulted in the following weighted scores : \n \n GENCO  JAY SHAPIRO  \nSTAFFING (max 30)  22.875  25.5  \nPROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN (max 30)  15 22.5 \nPRICE (max 40)  40 30 \nTOTAL SCORE (max 100)  77.875  78 \n \nId.; Contracting Officer\u2019 s Statement  (COS)  at 5.   \nThe contracting officer  then reviewed the evaluations in greater detail and noted that \nGENCO \u2019s quotation contained technical deficiencies :  \n \nThe QAP [quality assurance plan] does not include how GENCO would address contract issues that require escalation past the Team Lead.  The \n \n4 The RFQ did not define the term \u201c deficiency ,\u201d and GSA does not argue that the \npresence of one or more deficienc ies rendered GENCO \u2019s quotation unacceptable or \notherwise ineligible for award.  Cf.  MOL at 10 (asserting that a third vendor  was \nineligible for award but not making the same assertion as to GENCO ).    Page 4 B-423304  PMP [project management plan] states that the team lead will be assigned \nprojects in \u201c some cases \u201d while the SOW [statement of work in the RFQ] \nrequires \u201cTeam leader will provide CM services oversight for his\/her own \nprojects. \u201d  In both the QAP and PMP, GENCO does not discuss GENCO \u2019s \napproach to preparing requirements in the project planning stage.  GENCO specifies that the inspector is \u201c Night -time\u201d while the SOW \nspecifies \u201cOff-hours \u201d which may include weekends and Federal Holidays.   \n AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 3; COS at 7.   \n The contracting officer explained that  the evaluation of GENCO \u2019s quotation had \nidentified \u201cmany deficiencies,\u201d among which were the firm \u2019s failure to provide for \nweekend and holiday services.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 4.  The \ncontracting officer noted that GENCO\u2019 s total evaluated price was $1,051,616.80 lower \nthan Jay Shapiro\u2019 s price of $6,622,600.80, which represented a 17 percent price \ndifference in GENCO \u2019s favor, but that GENCO\u2019 s quotation failed to address all the SOW \nrequirements because it did not provide for services on weekends and holidays.  Id.  \nThe contracting officer  selected Jay Shapiro \u2019s quotation for award as the best value.  Id.    \n After receiving a brief explanation  of the agency \u2019s basis for award, GENCO filed a \nsecond agency -level protest, challenging the evaluation and award decision, which also \nargued that the agency had failed to properly implement the decision in the earlier \nagency -level protest.  GSA denied that second agency -level protest  on January 21, \n2025, AR, Tab 2, Decision on Second Agency -Level Protest at 10, after which GENCO \nfiled this protest.    \n \nDISCUSSION  Given the at -times confusing nature of the issues presented by the protester and the \nagency \u2019s response, w e begin with an overview  of the main points argued by each party .  \nGENCO \u2019s protest begins with a history of the procurement and previous protests, and \nthen challenge s the technical evaluation and tradeoff .  Protest at  4; see also id. at 6, 8 \n(arguing that agency -level protest decision \u201cwrongly sided with the Agency\u201d) .  GENCO \ncontends GSA failed to consider its arguments related to the \u201c unfair and unreasonable\u201d  \nbest-value determin ation.\u201d  Id. at 4.  That determination was unfair and unreasonable, \nGENCO argues,  because GSA failed to make \u201ca proper trade off as required under \n[FAR]  15.308. \u201d  Id. at 7.  GENCO argues that Jay Shapiro\u2019 s evaluated price was higher \nthan GENCO \u2019s price and, following the reevaluation,  both firms \u2019 total scores were \n78 points , meaning that GSA lacked a valid basis to select Jay Shapiro\u2019s  higher -priced \nquotation.  Id.    \nGENCO then argues that GSA\u2019 s best -value determination mentioned \u201cunsupported and \nunsubstantiated weaknesses\u201d but \u201clinked only one\u201d  weakness to the best -value \ndetermination.   Id.  This weakness was labeled a deficiency  for fail ing to address how \nthe firm would provide services during \u201coff hours\u201d that could include weekends and \nholidays, but only addressed services during nighttime hours.  Id.  GENCO states that \nits second agency -level protest  challenged that aspect of the evaluation as an \u201cunlisted  Page 5 B-423304  and unstated requirement ,\u201d and argued that the SOW did not indicate that the term \u201coff \nhours\u201d referred to weekends or holidays  and never mentioned the agency \u2019s requirement \nincluded services being provided on weekends or holidays .  Id. at 8-9.   \nGENCO next takes issue with the statement in the January 21 agency -level protest \ndecision that GENCO \u2019s price quotation failed to cover staffing for \u201call the contemplated \noff hours[,]\u201d including failing to fully price staffing for the off hours\/nighttime construction \ninspector.  Id. at 10.  GENCO disputes that conclusion  and affirms that its price \nquotation used the RFQ \u2019s pre-filled pricing schedule,  which listed 1920 hours per year \nfor each of the four full-time positions , one of which was the off hours\/nighttime \nconstruction inspector ; that is, the protester used the agency \u2019s specified pricing for the \nposition at 1920 hours per year  in the RFQ pricing schedule.  Id.  at 10; see Protest \nexh. 14, GENCO Quotation Price Schedule at  1-2.   \nIn challenging the source selection decision, GENCO argues that GSA  decided not to \nissue the order to the protester based on \u201cunsubstantiated deficiencies\u201d that the firm \ncontends were already rebutted.  Protest at  11.  GENCO also contends that the source \nselection decision lacks a proper tradeoff analysis and,  instead,  GSA \u201crandomly picked \nup a few sentences and made up its own interpretations to make it look like deficiencies to justify a high price award.\u201d  Id.  at 12.  Thus, GENCO argues, GSA failed to identify \nspecific benefits or discriminators t o justify paying Jay Shapiro\u2019 s higher price.  Id.   \nIn the agency report, GSA argues that the protest is entirely improper because it represents an attempt to have GAO review issues already considered by GSA in the two earlier agency -level protests.  As a result, GSA argues, the protest should be \ndismissed.  MOL at 2 (\u201c This protest is GENCO \u2019s third bite at the apple\u201d).\n5  GSA also \ncontends that even if the entire protest is not dismissed on that basis, our Office should dismiss as untimely the protester \u2019s challenges to the technical evaluation.   \nIn its comments responding to the agency report, GENCO disputes the characterization \nof its protest as including a challenge to the technical evaluation of its quotation.  Comments at 1; see also id.  at 2.  To the contrary, the protester asserts , its protest \nchallenges the decision in response to GENCO \u2019s second agency -level protest that GSA \nhad made a reasonable price reevaluation and best -value tradeoff.  Id.  at 1-2.  GENCO \n \n5 GSA terms GENCO \u2019s initial agency -level protest (sustained in part) a \u201cfirst bite\u201d at a \nmetaphorical protest apple, the firm \u2019s next agency -level protest, which challenged the \nnew award decision, was a \u201csecond bite,\u201d and this protest to our Office is a \u201cthird bite\u201d that GSA contends is impermissible and should therefore be dismissed.  MOL at 1- 2.  \nWe deny GSA \u2019s argument, which we view as contending that GENCO \u2019s entire protest is \nuntimely.  Our statutory jurisdiction provides no basis to reject a protest simply because \nthe issues were raised in one or more earlier agency -level protest s.  See  31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553 (a) (\u201cthe Comptroller General shall decide a protest submitted to the Comptroller \nGeneral by an interested party \u201d).  Consistent with that charge, our timeliness rules \nprovide specifically for a protest to be filed with our Office after a decision on an agency -\nlevel protest (or other initial adverse agency action).  4 C.F.R. section 21.2(a)(3).    Page 6 B-423304  contends that GSA \u2019s agency report  ignores the substance of the protest and does not \nclaim that the agency made any tradeoff analysis in reaching its source selection \ndecision.  Id.  at 2.  As a result, GENCO argues that since both firms \u2019 quotations \nreceived the same total score, GSA had no basis to select Jay Shapiro\u2019 s higher -priced \nquotation for award.  Id.    \nGENCO \u2019s comments then state that its protest \u201calready addressed\u201d the evaluation of a \ndeficiency in its quotation for failing to cover services during weekends and holidays, \nand the firm posits that it is unclear whether the agency considered the deficiency in \nmaking a tradeoff in favor of Jay Shapiro\u2019 s higher price.  Id.  at 3.  Ultimately, GENCO \nargues that the agency \u2019s position is misleading, confusing, and irrelevant, and that its \nprotest should therefore be sustained.  Id.    \nIn resolving the above various contentions, as an initial matter, we find that GENCO has \nabandoned any challenge to the technical evaluation by flatly stating in its comments that its protest did not challenge the technical evaluation.  Id. at 1 (explaining that the \n\u201c[a]gency report has further gone in length to wrongly describe our protest as a Challenge to the Technical Evaluation while our Protest to GAO is to challenge the Best Value Determination and Trade off analysis \u201d and \u201c as mentioned above GENCO is not \nprotesting Technical Evaluation\u201d); see also id.  at 2 (\u201cAgency is wrongly describing our \nprotest as a challenge to technical evaluation \u201d).  Instead, t he protester  affirms,  its \nprotest to our Office challenges the reevaluation of prices and r esulting source selection \ndecision and does not substantively address the response in the agency \u2019s report.  Id.  \nGiven GENCO \u2019s definitive statement in its comments that it does not intent to challenge \nits technical evaluation, we do not consider the protester \u2019s other --somewhat confusing--\nstatements to indicate an intent to pursue a challenge to the technical evaluation.  \nFurther, w here an agency responds to a protester \u2019s argument in the agency report and \nthe protester \u2019s comments in response fail to address the issue, our Office will consider \nthe issue abandoned by the protester.  Crowley Co. , B-258967, Feb. 21, 1995, \n95-1 CPD \u00b6 105 at 1 n.1; Mountaineers Fire Crew, Inc. et al. , B-413520.5 et al. , \nFeb. 27, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 77 at  13 n.6.   \nBased on our review , GENCO states it is challenging GSA\u2019 s failure to perform corrective \naction required by the first agency -level protest decision.  It also argues that the second \nagency -level protest decision was incorrect .  Apart from the abandoned challenge to the \nassessment of a deficiency under the technical evaluation discussed above, the central \ncontention in the protest is that GSA made an unreasonable tradeoff judgment that Jay Shapiro \u2019s higher -priced quotation was a better value than GENCO \u2019s despite both firms \nreceiving the same overall point scores.  The protester does not raise a specific \nchallenge to the calculation of prices or the application of the price scoring scheme; rather, its challenge to the price evaluation seems to be folded into its challenge to the tradeoff:  whether GENCO \u2019s lower price should have resulted in selection of its \nquotation for award.   \nAs stated above, t he essence of GENCO \u2019s remaining argument is that GSA  made an \nunreasonable tradeoff decision by  issuing the order to Jay Shapiro at its higher price.  \nThe protester contends  that GSA should have selected GENCO \u2019s quotation for award  Page 7 B-423304  based on its lower price, and the firm notes that after the reevaluation the two firms \u2019 \nquotations they achieved the same evaluation score of 78 points.6  Id. at 2-3.  \nWhere a protester challenges the outcome of a competition among FSS vendors under \nFAR subpart 8 for the issuance of an order , and vendors \u2019 responses form the basis for a \ntradeoff  that is like a competition in a negotiated procurement ( as contrast ed with a \nsimple FSS purchase) , we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s selection is \nreasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Verizon Fed. , Inc. , \nB-293527, Mar. 26, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 186 at 4 .  When an agency uses point scores to \ncompare among FSS vendors , the point scores  serve as guides to intelligent \ndecisionmaking.   Castro & Co. , B-412398, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 52 at 10.   Point \nscores do not mandate selection of a particular quotation, however, and source selection officials have broad discretion in determining the manner and extent to which \nthey will make use of  the scores  to reach a selection that is rational  and consistent with \nthe evaluation criteria.  Id.   \nThe record here confirms the reasonableness of the contracting officer \u2019s judgment in \nselecting Jay Shapiro \u2019s quotation over GENCO \u2019s despite their receiving the same point \nscores.  Contrary to GENCO\u2019 s argument, the RFQ did not provide for pricing to be the \ndeciding factor in the event of a tie; indeed, the point scores already included the \nassessment of points  for each offeror \u2019s price.  GENCO received 40 points because its \nprice was below the government estimate, while Jay Shapiro received 30 because its price was above the estimate.

Hughes, Esq., General Services Administration, for the agency.  \nPaul N. Wengert , Esq., and Tania Calhoun, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, \nparticipated in the preparation of the decision.   \nDIGEST  \n Protest that agency failed to properly consider protester \u2019s price and unreasonably \nissued Federal Supply Schedule order to higher -priced vendor is denied where the \nrecord shows the agency \u2019s source selection decision reasonably determined that \nsuccessful vendor \u2019s quotation provided the best value under the solicitation criteria.    \nDECISION  \n GENCO Systems, Inc., of Herndon, Virginia, a small business, protests the General \nServices Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service \u2019s issuance of a task order \nunder a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) blanket purchase agreement  (BPA) to Jay \nShapiro & Associates, Inc ., of Far Hills, New Jersey .  The agency issued the task order \nunder request for quotations (RFQ) No. 47PC0224Q0020, for c onstruction management \nservices  at the Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Office Building in Jamaica, New York.  \nGENCO argues that GSA improperly selected Jay Shapiro\u2019s quotation over GENCO \u2019s \nlower -priced quotation.   \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n GSA issued the RFQ to firms hold ing FSS multiple -award national BPAs  for \nconstruction management services, program\/project management services, and  Page 2 B-423304  building\/lease inspection services --zone 1.1  The RFQ itself (labeled as an \u201cinstruction \nto offeror\u201d ) stated that the agency intended to issue a fixed- priced task order to the \nvendor whose quotation provided the best value, which would be determined by \u201c a \ntradeoff between non- cost factors and cost\/price. \u201d  RFQ at 2.  GSA states that the \nprocurement was conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \nsection 8.405- 3, the provisions of which describe the issuance of BPAs and the process \nfor ordering under them.  Memorandum of L aw (MOL ) at 1.  The RFQ listed three \nfactors and their weighting:  staffing plan (30 percent), project management plan (30 \npercent) and price (40 percent).  Id.  at 2-3.  The project management plan factor was \ndivided into two equally weighted subfactors :  quality assurance plan (15 percent) and \nprogram management plan (15 percent).  Id. at 3.   \n \nThe statement of work (SOW) for  the RFQ described the required staffing as :  \none (1) Off hours\/Night Time Construction Inspector dedicated to providing Off hours and night time inspection services for all ongoing construction projects, one (1) Senior Project Manager \/ Team Leader, two (2) Senior Construction Managers with mechanical and electrical \nexperience, Senior Commissioning Agent, Commissioning Agent and a Commissioning Specialist or equivalent contract labor categories.  \nProtest exh. 1, SOW at 4 .\n2 \n Under the heading of hours worked, the SOW further specified:  \n \nThe contractor \u2019s onsite CM [construction management] staff (onsite CM \nstaff includes one (1) Off  hours\/Night time inspector \u2013  who shall be onsite \nfor 40 hours a week during off hours to include night time to perform construction phase inspection services, a work schedule shall be submitted on weekly basis for GSA approval, this work schedule shall be created based on the construction schedule of all ongoing projects [)].   \n Id. at 2.   \n Two vendors submitted quotations:  GENCO , the incumbent contractor , and Jay \nShapiro .\n3  The evaluation used point scores to indicate the merit of each quotation \n \n1 The term \u201czone 1\u201d appears to have been used during the competition for the \nunderlying FSS BPAs to describe their  geographic scope, which covered multiple GSA \nPublic Buildings Service regions.  The RFQ indicates that the Addabbo building is in \nGSA Public Buildings Service region No. 2.  Protest exh. 2, RFQ at 1.   \n2 GENCO explains, and GSA does not dispute, that this amounted to four full -time \npositions (one the off hours\/night  time position) and three part -time positions.    \n3 The record contains a brief reference to a third vendor  and indicates that its quotation \nwas ineligible for award.   MOL at 10.   Accordingly , we do not discuss it further.    Page 3 B-423304  under each factor and subfactor, which included assessing a score for the price factor.   \nAs relevant here, the evaluation concluded that GENCO \u2019s quotation had what the \nagency refers to as \u201cdeficienc ies\u201d4 regarding the firm \u2019s approach to escalation of issues, \nits project planning, and its staffing of the off -hours\/nighttime construction inspector \nposition.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  3.   \n \nAfter completing the evaluati on, GSA issued the task order to Jay Shapiro.  GENCO \nrequested a brief explanation and then filed an agency -level protest  challenging GSA \u2019s \nevaluation of the firm \u2019s quotation and the decision to award the order at a higher price \nas unreasonable and inconsistent with the RFQ .  GSA sustained GENCO \u2019s protest in \npart, finding that the agency  had improperly weighted the price factor in making the \nbest-value determination, and directed the contracting officer to properly weight the \nprice factor and make a new source selection decision.  AR, Tab 1, Decision on First \nAgency -Level Protest at  12-13.  The agency denied GENCO \u2019s remaining challenges.    \n GSA revised the price evaluation and recalculated both firms \u2019 evaluated scores.  To \nimplement the agency -level protest decision, the agency used a revised price evaluation \nscheme that assigned scores to offerors \u2019 total prices on the following basis:  a pric e \nmore than 15 percent below the agency \u2019s estimate would receive the maximum \nweighted score of 40 points; a price below the estimate by less than 15 percent would receive 30 points; a price equal to or above the estimate by up to 15 percent would receive 20 points; and a price more than 15 percent above the estimate would be \nunacceptable and receive no points.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at  2.  \nGENCO \u2019s total evaluated price of $5,570,984 received a price score of 40 points, while \nJay Shapiro\u2019 s price of $6,622,600.80 received 30 points.  Id. at 3.  The recalculation \nresulted in the following weighted scores : \n \n GENCO  JAY SHAPIRO  \nSTAFFING (max 30)  22.875  25.5  \nPROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN (max 30)  15 22.5 \nPRICE (max 40)  40 30 \nTOTAL SCORE (max 100)  77.875  78 \n \nId.; Contracting Officer\u2019 s Statement  (COS)  at 5.   \nThe contracting officer  then reviewed the evaluations in greater detail and noted that \nGENCO \u2019s quotation contained technical deficiencies :  \n \nThe QAP [quality assurance plan] does not include how GENCO would address contract issues that require escalation past the Team Lead.  The \n \n4 The RFQ did not define the term \u201c deficiency ,\u201d and GSA does not argue that the \npresence of one or more deficienc ies rendered GENCO \u2019s quotation unacceptable or \notherwise ineligible for award.  Cf.  MOL at 10 (asserting that a third vendor  was \nineligible for award but not making the same assertion as to GENCO ).    Page 4 B-423304  PMP [project management plan] states that the team lead will be assigned \nprojects in \u201c some cases \u201d while the SOW [statement of work in the RFQ] \nrequires \u201cTeam leader will provide CM services oversight for his\/her own \nprojects. \u201d  In both the QAP and PMP, GENCO does not discuss GENCO \u2019s \napproach to preparing requirements in the project planning stage.  GENCO specifies that the inspector is \u201c Night -time\u201d while the SOW \nspecifies \u201cOff-hours \u201d which may include weekends and Federal Holidays.   \n AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 3; COS at 7.   \n The contracting officer explained that  the evaluation of GENCO \u2019s quotation had \nidentified \u201cmany deficiencies,\u201d among which were the firm \u2019s failure to provide for \nweekend and holiday services.  AR, Tab 6, Best -Value Determination at 4.  The \ncontracting officer noted that GENCO\u2019 s total evaluated price was $1,051,616.80 lower \nthan Jay Shapiro\u2019 s price of $6,622,600.80, which represented a 17 percent price \ndifference in GENCO \u2019s favor, but that GENCO\u2019 s quotation failed to address all the SOW \nrequirements because it did not provide for services on weekends and holidays.  Id.  \nThe contracting officer  selected Jay Shapiro \u2019s quotation for award as the best value.  Id.    \n After receiving a brief explanation  of the agency \u2019s basis for award, GENCO filed a \nsecond agency -level protest, challenging the evaluation and award decision, which also \nargued that the agency had failed to properly implement the decision in the earlier \nagency -level protest.  GSA denied that second agency -level protest  on January 21, \n2025, AR, Tab 2, Decision on Second Agency -Level Protest at 10, after which GENCO \nfiled this protest.    \n \nDISCUSSION  Given the at -times confusing nature of the issues presented by the protester and the \nagency \u2019s response, w e begin with an overview  of the main points argued by each party .  \nGENCO \u2019s protest begins with a history of the procurement and previous protests, and \nthen challenge s the technical evaluation and tradeoff .  Protest at  4; see also id. at 6, 8 \n(arguing that agency -level protest decision \u201cwrongly sided with the Agency\u201d) .  GENCO \ncontends GSA failed to consider its arguments related to the \u201c unfair and unreasonable\u201d  \nbest-value determin ation.\u201d  Id. at 4.  That determination was unfair and unreasonable, \nGENCO argues,  because GSA failed to make \u201ca proper trade off as required under \n[FAR]  15.308. \u201d  Id. at 7.  GENCO argues that Jay Shapiro\u2019 s evaluated price was higher \nthan GENCO \u2019s price and, following the reevaluation,  both firms \u2019 total scores were \n78 points , meaning that GSA lacked a valid basis to select Jay Shapiro\u2019s  higher -priced \nquotation.  Id.    \nGENCO then argues that GSA\u2019 s best -value determination mentioned \u201cunsupported and \nunsubstantiated weaknesses\u201d but \u201clinked only one\u201d  weakness to the best -value \ndetermination.   Id.  This weakness was labeled a deficiency  for fail ing to address how \nthe firm would provide services during \u201coff hours\u201d that could include weekends and \nholidays, but only addressed services during nighttime hours.  Id.  GENCO states that \nits second agency -level protest  challenged that aspect of the evaluation as an \u201cunlisted  Page 5 B-423304  and unstated requirement ,\u201d and argued that the SOW did not indicate that the term \u201coff \nhours\u201d referred to weekends or holidays  and never mentioned the agency \u2019s requirement \nincluded services being provided on weekends or holidays .  Id. at 8-9.   \nGENCO next takes issue with the statement in the January 21 agency -level protest \ndecision that GENCO \u2019s price quotation failed to cover staffing for \u201call the contemplated \noff hours[,]\u201d including failing to fully price staffing for the off hours\/nighttime construction \ninspector.  Id. at 10.  GENCO disputes that conclusion  and affirms that its price \nquotation used the RFQ \u2019s pre-filled pricing schedule,  which listed 1920 hours per year \nfor each of the four full-time positions , one of which was the off hours\/nighttime \nconstruction inspector ; that is, the protester used the agency \u2019s specified pricing for the \nposition at 1920 hours per year  in the RFQ pricing schedule.  Id.  at 10; see Protest \nexh. 14, GENCO Quotation Price Schedule at  1-2.   \nIn challenging the source selection decision, GENCO argues that GSA  decided not to \nissue the order to the protester based on \u201cunsubstantiated deficiencies\u201d that the firm \ncontends were already rebutted.  Protest at  11.  GENCO also contends that the source \nselection decision lacks a proper tradeoff analysis and,  instead,  GSA \u201crandomly picked \nup a few sentences and made up its own interpretations to make it look like deficiencies to justify a high price award.\u201d  Id.  at 12.  Thus, GENCO argues, GSA failed to identify \nspecific benefits or discriminators t o justify paying Jay Shapiro\u2019 s higher price.  Id.   \nIn the agency report, GSA argues that the protest is entirely improper because it represents an attempt to have GAO review issues already considered by GSA in the two earlier agency -level protests.  As a result, GSA argues, the protest should be \ndismissed.  MOL at 2 (\u201c This protest is GENCO \u2019s third bite at the apple\u201d).\n5  GSA also \ncontends that even if the entire protest is not dismissed on that basis, our Office should dismiss as untimely the protester \u2019s challenges to the technical evaluation.   \nIn its comments responding to the agency report, GENCO disputes the characterization \nof its protest as including a challenge to the technical evaluation of its quotation.  Comments at 1; see also id.  at 2.  To the contrary, the protester asserts , its protest \nchallenges the decision in response to GENCO \u2019s second agency -level protest that GSA \nhad made a reasonable price reevaluation and best -value tradeoff.  Id.  at 1-2.  GENCO \n \n5 GSA terms GENCO \u2019s initial agency -level protest (sustained in part) a \u201cfirst bite\u201d at a \nmetaphorical protest apple, the firm \u2019s next agency -level protest, which challenged the \nnew award decision, was a \u201csecond bite,\u201d and this protest to our Office is a \u201cthird bite\u201d that GSA contends is impermissible and should therefore be dismissed.  MOL at 1- 2.  \nWe deny GSA \u2019s argument, which we view as contending that GENCO \u2019s entire protest is \nuntimely.  Our statutory jurisdiction provides no basis to reject a protest simply because \nthe issues were raised in one or more earlier agency -level protest s.  See  31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553 (a) (\u201cthe Comptroller General shall decide a protest submitted to the Comptroller \nGeneral by an interested party \u201d).  Consistent with that charge, our timeliness rules \nprovide specifically for a protest to be filed with our Office after a decision on an agency -\nlevel protest (or other initial adverse agency action).  4 C.F.R. section 21.2(a)(3).    Page 6 B-423304  contends that GSA \u2019s agency report  ignores the substance of the protest and does not \nclaim that the agency made any tradeoff analysis in reaching its source selection \ndecision.  Id.  at 2.  As a result, GENCO argues that since both firms \u2019 quotations \nreceived the same total score, GSA had no basis to select Jay Shapiro\u2019 s higher -priced \nquotation for award.  Id.    \nGENCO \u2019s comments then state that its protest \u201calready addressed\u201d the evaluation of a \ndeficiency in its quotation for failing to cover services during weekends and holidays, \nand the firm posits that it is unclear whether the agency considered the deficiency in \nmaking a tradeoff in favor of Jay Shapiro\u2019 s higher price.  Id.  at 3.  Ultimately, GENCO \nargues that the agency \u2019s position is misleading, confusing, and irrelevant, and that its \nprotest should therefore be sustained.  Id.    \nIn resolving the above various contentions, as an initial matter, we find that GENCO has \nabandoned any challenge to the technical evaluation by flatly stating in its comments that its protest did not challenge the technical evaluation.  Id. at 1 (explaining that the \n\u201c[a]gency report has further gone in length to wrongly describe our protest as a Challenge to the Technical Evaluation while our Protest to GAO is to challenge the Best Value Determination and Trade off analysis \u201d and \u201c as mentioned above GENCO is not \nprotesting Technical Evaluation\u201d); see also id.  at 2 (\u201cAgency is wrongly describing our \nprotest as a challenge to technical evaluation \u201d).  Instead, t he protester  affirms,  its \nprotest to our Office challenges the reevaluation of prices and r esulting source selection \ndecision and does not substantively address the response in the agency \u2019s report.  Id.  \nGiven GENCO \u2019s definitive statement in its comments that it does not intent to challenge \nits technical evaluation, we do not consider the protester \u2019s other --somewhat confusing--\nstatements to indicate an intent to pursue a challenge to the technical evaluation.  \nFurther, w here an agency responds to a protester \u2019s argument in the agency report and \nthe protester \u2019s comments in response fail to address the issue, our Office will consider \nthe issue abandoned by the protester.

It also argues that the second \nagency -level protest decision was incorrect .  Apart from the abandoned challenge to the \nassessment of a deficiency under the technical evaluation discussed above, the central \ncontention in the protest is that GSA made an unreasonable tradeoff judgment that Jay Shapiro \u2019s higher -priced quotation was a better value than GENCO \u2019s despite both firms \nreceiving the same overall point scores.  The protester does not raise a specific \nchallenge to the calculation of prices or the application of the price scoring scheme; rather, its challenge to the price evaluation seems to be folded into its challenge to the tradeoff:  whether GENCO \u2019s lower price should have resulted in selection of its \nquotation for award.   \nAs stated above, t he essence of GENCO \u2019s remaining argument is that GSA  made an \nunreasonable tradeoff decision by  issuing the order to Jay Shapiro at its higher price.  \nThe protester contends  that GSA should have selected GENCO \u2019s quotation for award  Page 7 B-423304  based on its lower price, and the firm notes that after the reevaluation the two firms \u2019 \nquotations they achieved the same evaluation score of 78 points.6  Id. at 2-3.  \nWhere a protester challenges the outcome of a competition among FSS vendors under \nFAR subpart 8 for the issuance of an order , and vendors \u2019 responses form the basis for a \ntradeoff  that is like a competition in a negotiated procurement ( as contrast ed with a \nsimple FSS purchase) , we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s selection is \nreasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Verizon Fed. , Inc. , \nB-293527, Mar. 26, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 186 at 4 .  When an agency uses point scores to \ncompare among FSS vendors , the point scores  serve as guides to intelligent \ndecisionmaking.   Castro & Co. , B-412398, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 52 at 10.   Point \nscores do not mandate selection of a particular quotation, however, and source selection officials have broad discretion in determining the manner and extent to which \nthey will make use of  the scores  to reach a selection that is rational  and consistent with \nthe evaluation criteria.  Id.   \nThe record here confirms the reasonableness of the contracting officer \u2019s judgment in \nselecting Jay Shapiro \u2019s quotation over GENCO \u2019s despite their receiving the same point \nscores.  Contrary to GENCO\u2019 s argument, the RFQ did not provide for pricing to be the \ndeciding factor in the event of a tie; indeed, the point scores already included the \nassessment of points  for each offeror \u2019s price.  GENCO received 40 points because its \nprice was below the government estimate, while Jay Shapiro received 30 because its price was above the estimate.  The resulting calculation of both firms scores at 78 points therefore included a quantification of GENCO \u2019s price advantage.   \nHowever , as explained above, a reasonable tradeoff required the contracting officer to \nexamine  the substance of the evaluations, not just the point scores , and then to \ndetermine  which vendor offered the best value under the factors specified in the RFQ.  \nId.  Our review of the record shows the contracting officer made just such a reasoned \njudgment .  The contracting officer reasonably determined that selection of Jay Shapiro\u2019 s \nquotation at its higher price represented a better value when compared to GENCO \u2019s \nquotation which had an evaluated deficiency, even at a lower price.   The record \nadequately documents the contracting officer \u2019s judgment that, due to the assessment of \na deficiency to GENCO \u2019s quotation for failing to address off -hours services on weekend \nand holidays, the firm \u2019s lower -priced quotation was not the best value when compared \nto Jay Shapiro\u2019 s quotation.   In sum, that judgment was reasonable and consistent with \nthe evaluation criteria in the RFQ, so we deny GENCO \u2019s protest.   \nThe protest is denied.

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the agency\u2019s termination of protester\u2019s awarded contract is denied where, upon reevaluation, the agency reasonably found the protester\u2019s proposal to be technically unacceptable.  \nDECISION  \n Taylor Made Transportation Services, Inc., a small business of Baltimore, Maryland, protests the reevaluation of its proposal, its elimination from competition, and the termination of its award for the convenience of the government under request for propos als (RFP) No.  36C24524R0044, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) for van shuttle transportation services.  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably reevaluated its proposal as technically unacceptable, and thus, the agency\u2019s decision to terminate the protester\u2019s contract for convenience was improper.  \n We deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the solicitation on May 14, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, as a small business set -aside.\n1  \n \n1 The solicitation anticipated a tiered evaluation approach.  The VA sought to award a \ncontract to a service- disabled veteran- owned small business (SDVOSB).  However, \u201c[i]f \nno proposals were submitted by SDVOSB concerns, or if none of the proposals would \n(continued...)

This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423117.3  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1; Agency Report (AR), Exh. 16, RFP at 152.2  \nThe VA sought shuttle transportation services for VA beneficiaries and employees \nwithin the VA Maryland healthcare system.  RFP at 175.  The agency anticipated award \nof a fixed- price contract for one base year and four  option years.  Id. at 79.  \n \nAward was to be made on a lowest -priced, technically acceptable ( LPTA)  basis, \nconsidering the following evaluation factors:   technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  \nat 151.  The technical factor was comprised of four subfactors:  (1) large scale shuttle \ntransportation experience; (2) company stability\/longevity; (3) company safety record\/program; and (4) personnel.  Id.   \n The VA initially  made award to Taylor Made on October 9, 2024, which resulted in a \nprotest to our Office filed by RTW Management, an unsuccessful offeror .  Memorandum \nof Law (MOL)  at 3; COS at 1.  RTW challenged the acceptability of Taylor Made\u2019 s \nproposal .  AR, Exh. 6 , First RTW Protest .  In response, the agency notified our Office of \nits intent to take corrective action by reevaluating Taylor Made\u2019s proposal.  MOL at 4.  Relevant here, the agency did not terminate the contract to Taylor Made but suspended \nperformance pending completion of the reevaluation.  As a result of the agency\u2019s \nproposed corrective action, we dismissed that protest as academic on November 20, \n2024.  RTW Management , B-423117.1, Nov. 20, 2024 (unpublished decision).   \n On November 27, the VA reevaluated Taylor Made\u2019s proposal and found it, again, to be \ntechnically acceptable.  MOL at 4; AR, Exh. 2, Revised Source Selection Decision \n(SSD) at 3.  That award decision resulted in a second protest by RTW.  AR, Exh. 8, \nSecond RTW Protest; MOL at 4.  On January 24, 2025, the VA notified our Office that it \nintended to take corrective action in response to the second protest.  MOL at 5.  The VA \nexplained that as a result of GAO\u2019s request for additional information following \nsubmis sion of the agency report, the contracting officer reevaluated Taylor Made\u2019s \nproposal and found that the proposal did not, in fact, meet the RFP\u2019s requirements and was, therefore, technically unacceptable.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer\u2019s \nReevaluation D etermination at 1; MOL at 5.  Based on this finding, the VA advised that \nit would take corrective action by terminating Taylor Made\u2019s contract and evaluating the proposal of the next lowest -priced offeror (RTW) to determine whether that proposal \n \nresult in award at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government, \nthen the SDVOSB set -aside will be withdrawn and the agency will review quotes from \nthe next tier.\u201d  RFP at 151.  The agency then sought to prioritize proposals submitt ed by \nveteran- owned small businesses (VOSBs).  If no proposals were submitted by VOSBs, \nor if none of the proposals would result in award at a fair and reasonable price, then the agency would review proposals from small businesses.  Id.

Taylor Made, subsequently, \nfiled th is protest with our Office on February 24.  \n DISCUSSION  \n Taylor Made argues that the VA improperly found the protester\u2019s proposal to be technically unacceptable, and thus, the VA\u2019s termination of Taylor Made\u2019s contract was improper.  Protest at 4- 7.  The protester also argues that any subsequent award to RTW \nis unreasonable because RTW, itself, does not meet the solicitation requirements.  Id. \nat 8.  The agency responds that the contracting officer erred in initially finding Taylor \nMade\u2019s proposal technically acceptable, that the protester was improperly awarded the contract, and as such, termination of the protester\u2019s contract was warranted.  MOL at 7.  Although we do not specifically address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester\u2019s arguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest.\n3 \n As an initial matter, our Office generally will not review the termination of contracts because such actions are matters of contract administration that fall outside of GAO\u2019s bid protest jurisdiction.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.5(a); Phenix Rsch.

Our Office will, however, consider the termination of a \ncontract where the agency\u2019s decision to terminate the contract flows from a defect the contracting agency perceived in the award process.  Optimum Servs., Inc ., B-401051, \nApr. 1 5, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6  85 at 2.  Here, there is no dispute between the parties that \nthe agency\u2019s decision to terminate Taylor Made\u2019s award for convenience arose from an alleged defect in the VA\u2019s evaluation process.  See  MOL at 6 -7; Protest at 1- 2.  In cases \n \n3 For example, the protester argues that RTW\u2019s second protest was untimely, and \u201cthe \nVA\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract for convenience is based on an improperly considered protest and should be retracted for that reason alone.\u201d  Protest at 8.  The agency substantively responded to this allegation in the agency report .  MOL at 8 n.2.  \nThe protester neither refuted the agency\u2019s response nor did it pursue this allegation in its comments to the agency report.  See  Comments.  W here, as here,  an agency \nprovides a detailed response to a protester \u2019s assertions and the protester fails to rebut \nor otherwise substantively address the agency \u2019s arguments in its comments, the \nprotester provides us with no basis to conclude that the agency \u2019s position with respect \nto the issue in question is unreasonable or improper.   4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3(i)(3); C2C \nInnovative Sols., Inc ., B-416289, B -416289.2, July 30, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 269 at 6.

Protest at 5- 7.  The VA responds, explaining \nthat the protester\u2019s proposal was found to be technically unacceptable, in part, becaus e \nTaylor Made\u2019s prior experience references were not completed within five years of solicitation issuance.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer\u2019s Reevaluation Determination at 1.  The protester argues that the solicitation did not require all prior experience \nreferences to be completed within five years of the issuance of the RFP.  Protest at 6.   \n Relevant here, the RFP\u2019s first technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation experience) required the following:  \n \nThe Offeror shall demonstrate proof of experience as the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract.  Included in these routes[,] specific criteria need to be submitted as proof of \nexperience:  \n \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a continuous basis along \na designated route \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis  \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least two concurrent shuttle routes having a minimum passenger capacity of 18 or greater.  \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-\nambulatory access equipment  \n RFP at 152.  Additionally, offerors were asked to provide the \u201c[l]ocation and brief description of the work[,] including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting method within the last five (5) years.\u201d   Id.   \n Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references  with its proposal, one performed \nfor the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , and one performed for the \nVA.  AR, Exh. 7, Protester\u2019s Proposal at 20.  Taylor made does not challenge the \nagency\u2019s conclusion that the CMS contract  did not meet all route requirements listed in \nthe RFP.  MOL at 9 n. 3; see generally Protest .  Instead, the gravamen of the \nprotester\u2019s arguments focuses on challenging the agency\u2019s determination that the VA contract reference did not meet the requirements of the technic al subfactor.   Page 5 B-423117.3   \nAs noted above, in reevaluating the protester\u2019s proposal, the contracting officer determined that the protester had failed to meet the solicitation\u2019s prior experience requirements, as Taylor Made\u2019s \u201c[t]echnical proposal did not provide the location and brief description of the work including the building use and contracting method within the \nlast five (5) years . . . in its proposal to demonstrate its large- scale shuttle transportation \nexperience.\u201d  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer\u2019s Reevaluation Determinat ion at 1; see \nRFP at 152.  We address, first, the protester\u2019s challenge to the requirement that the submitted prior experience be performed within the last five years.  \n  Mandatory Language  \n In arguing that its proposal met the solicitation\u2019s prior experience requirements --and \nthus was not technically unacceptable--Taylor Made contends that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation is unreasonable.  In this regard, the protester makes a multi -prong challenge.  First, Taylor Made argues that the solicitation did not \u201cmandate \nthat all experience must be limited to the past 5 years\u201d because the RFP did not use the \u201ctype of mandatory language [like] \u2018must\u2019 in limiting the types of experience that could be considered under Subfactor 1.\u201d  Protest at 6.  We find this contention to be without merit because the protester conveniently disregards the word \u201cshall\u201d in the subfactor\u2019s requirement.  See RFP at 152 (\u201cThe Offeror shall  demonstrate proof of experience as \nthe sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes . .  .\u201d) (emphasis added).  As our decisions have explained, the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory, and not permissive in nature.

As such, the solicitation \nexpressly mandated that an offeror submit a prior experience reference that met the solicitation requirements, provide the location and brief description of work for that experience, and that the reference be completed within the last five years.  \n  Reasonable Interpretation \n Next, the protester argues that the only reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cwithin t he \nlast five (5) years \u201d is that some-- rather than all --referenced projects needed to be \ncompleted within five years of the issuance of the solicitation.  Protest at 6 (\u201cThe only \nreasonable interpretation is just that a bidder must provide some information to satisfy \nSection 1.1.  A reasonable bidder would not understand this to be a blanket, 5- year \ncutoff of experience . . .\u201d).  Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation \u2019s actual \nrequirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.   Sikorsky \nAircraft Corp., B -416027, B -416027.2, May 22, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6  177 at 11.   When  a \nprotester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretati on must be \nconsistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.   PAE \nAviation & Tech. Servs., LLC , B-418828.3, Mar. 17, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  153 at 9.    \n  Page 6 B-423117.3  Here, we find the agency \u2019s interpretation of the solicitation reasonable, and the \nprotester \u2019s interpretation not reasonable.  The RFP stated:  \u201c Provide location and brief \ndescription of the work including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting \nmethod within the last five (5) years. \u201d  RFP at 152.  The solicitation clearly advised \nofferors that they should provide the location and description of work for the experience references submitted.  Id. at 152.  The only reasonable reading of this l anguage is that \nthe agency intended offerors to submit those location and work descriptions for each reference submitted.  Further, we find that the only reasonable reading of the phrase \u201cwithin the last five (5) years ,\u201d is that the phrase modifies what comes before it in the \nsentence.  See Kevcon, Inc. , B-406024.3,  June 18, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  221 at 6- 7 \n(finding that term at end of sentence modified the whole sentence).  As such, we find \nthat the provision is most reasonably read as requiring an offeror to s ubmit references, \neach performed within the last five years, that detailed the location of performance and a description of the work performed.  \n When read as a whole, it is clear from the requirements of this technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation services) that the agency wanted offerors to demonstrate prior experience that was both relevant and recent.  With respect to relevance,  the \nsubfactor required offerors to demonstrate experience performing \u201cas the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract,\u201d that met the specified criteria ( e.g., \u201coperating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-\nambulatory access equipment\u201d ).  RFP at 152.  For recency, the subfactor required \nrelevant prior experience to have been performed \u201cwithin the last five (5) years.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder the protester\u2019s interpretation, offerors would be able to meet the subfactor\u2019s requirement by submitting one experience reference that was relevant --i.e., met the \nlisted criteria such as \u201coperating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis\u201d --and another \nexperience reference that met the recency requirement of being within five years.  Ev en \nif we agreed with the protester\u2019s interpretation--which we do not --this interpretation \nwould require giving no effect to the requirement that the demonstrated experience be \u201con a single contract.\u201d  RFP at 152.  Accordingly, we find the protester\u2019s inter pretation to \nbe unreasonable when the solicitation is read as a whole and giving effect to the plain language of the provision.  PAE Aviation & Tech. Servs., LLC, supra at 9-10. \n  Well- Written Proposal  \n Finally, the protester argues that its proposal  did, in fact, demonstrate that performance \nwas completed within the 5 -year timeframe .  Taylor Made alleges that there had been \nmodifications and extensions made to contracts it held with the VA for transportation services, and as result, performance had been extended beyond March of 2019.  Protest  at 5-6. \n Here, the VA issued the solicitation on May 14, 2025.  COS at 1.  As such, any prior experience references submitted by offerors were required to be completed after May 14, 2019, to be considered completed \u201cwithin the last five (5) years.\u201d  The only \ninform ation Taylor Made presented in its proposal, however, demonstrates the last \npossible date of completion of its VA shuttle transportation contract was March of 2019.   Page 7 B-423117.3  See AR, Exh. 7, Protester\u2019s Proposal at 20.  Specifically, Taylor Made\u2019s proposal clearly \nstates that \u201cContract End\u201d for the VA contract was \u201c03\/2019.\u201d4  Id.  Further, none of the \ncontract numbers associated with performance of the VA contract that were explicitly \nidentified in the proposal indicated that performance extended beyond March of 2019.  Id. at 17; MOL at 11.  While the protester also cites to multiple examples of contract \nextensions in its protest, the record demonstrates that such references were not \nincluded in Taylor Made\u2019s proposal, nor did those references pertain to the protester\u2019s \nshuttle transportation experience.  MOL at  11 (noting, among others, that modification of \ncontract cited in protest pertained to the provision of sedan services, rather than shuttle transportation services, and was not evaluated by contracting officer because reference \nwas not included in protester\u2019s proposal).   \n \nIn reviewing protests of alleged evaluations and source selections, our Office examines \nthe record to determine whether the agency judgment was reasonable and in accord with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws.  T -C Transcription, \nInc., B-401470.2, Feb. 16, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6 50 at 4.  It is an offeror \u2019s responsibility to \nsubmit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly \ndemonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by t he \nprocuring agency.  In this regard, an offeror must affirmatively demonstrate the merits of its proposal, which is at risk of rejection if the offeror fails to do so.  Id.    \n On the record before us, we find nothing on the face of the protester\u2019s proposal informed the agency that the listed VA contracts were performed within five years of \nsolicitation issuance.

As such, the agency was reasonable in terminating the contract that was initially awarded to Taylor Made, because an unacceptable proposal cannot form the basis for award.\n5  \n \n4 Although Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references (CMS and VA) to \nmeet the first technical subfactor requirements, the protester listed several contract numbers as part of its VA experience reference.

The protester argues that the agency unreasonably reevaluated its proposal as technically unacceptable, and thus, the agency\u2019s decision to terminate the protester\u2019s contract for convenience was improper.  \n We deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the solicitation on May 14, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, as a small business set -aside.\n1  \n \n1 The solicitation anticipated a tiered evaluation approach.

RFP at 175.  The agency anticipated award \nof a fixed- price contract for one base year and four  option years.  Id. at 79.  \n \nAward was to be made on a lowest -priced, technically acceptable ( LPTA)  basis, \nconsidering the following evaluation factors:   technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  \nat 151.  The technical factor was comprised of four subfactors:  (1) large scale shuttle \ntransportation experience; (2) company stability\/longevity; (3) company safety record\/program; and (4) personnel.  Id.   \n The VA initially  made award to Taylor Made on October 9, 2024, which resulted in a \nprotest to our Office filed by RTW Management, an unsuccessful offeror .  Memorandum \nof Law (MOL)  at 3; COS at 1.  RTW challenged the acceptability of Taylor Made\u2019 s \nproposal .  AR, Exh. 6 , First RTW Protest .  In response, the agency notified our Office of \nits intent to take corrective action by reevaluating Taylor Made\u2019s proposal.  MOL at 4.  Relevant here, the agency did not terminate the contract to Taylor Made but suspended \nperformance pending completion of the reevaluation.  As a result of the agency\u2019s \nproposed corrective action, we dismissed that protest as academic on November 20, \n2024.  RTW Management , B-423117.1, Nov. 20, 2024 (unpublished decision).   \n On November 27, the VA reevaluated Taylor Made\u2019s proposal and found it, again, to be \ntechnically acceptable.  MOL at 4; AR, Exh. 2, Revised Source Selection Decision \n(SSD) at 3.  That award decision resulted in a second protest by RTW.  AR, Exh. 8, \nSecond RTW Protest; MOL at 4.  On January 24, 2025, the VA notified our Office that it \nintended to take corrective action in response to the second protest.  MOL at 5.  The VA \nexplained that as a result of GAO\u2019s request for additional information following \nsubmis sion of the agency report, the contracting officer reevaluated Taylor Made\u2019s \nproposal and found that the proposal did not, in fact, meet the RFP\u2019s requirements and was, therefore, technically unacceptable.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer\u2019s \nReevaluation D etermination at 1; MOL at 5.  Based on this finding, the VA advised that \nit would take corrective action by terminating Taylor Made\u2019s contract and evaluating the proposal of the next lowest -priced offeror (RTW) to determine whether that proposal \n \nresult in award at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government, \nthen the SDVOSB set -aside will be withdrawn and the agency will review quotes from \nthe next tier.\u201d  RFP at 151.  The agency then sought to prioritize proposals submitt ed by \nveteran- owned small businesses (VOSBs).

Taylor Made, subsequently, \nfiled th is protest with our Office on February 24.  \n DISCUSSION  \n Taylor Made argues that the VA improperly found the protester\u2019s proposal to be technically unacceptable, and thus, the VA\u2019s termination of Taylor Made\u2019s contract was improper.  Protest at 4- 7.  The protester also argues that any subsequent award to RTW \nis unreasonable because RTW, itself, does not meet the solicitation requirements.  Id. \nat 8.

Although we do not specifically address every issue raised, we have considered all of the protester\u2019s arguments and conclude none furnishes a basis on which to sustain the protest.\n3 \n As an initial matter, our Office generally will not review the termination of contracts because such actions are matters of contract administration that fall outside of GAO\u2019s bid protest jurisdiction.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.5(a); Phenix Rsch.

Here, there is no dispute between the parties that \nthe agency\u2019s decision to terminate Taylor Made\u2019s award for convenience arose from an alleged defect in the VA\u2019s evaluation process.  See  MOL at 6 -7; Protest at 1- 2.  In cases \n \n3 For example, the protester argues that RTW\u2019s second protest was untimely, and \u201cthe \nVA\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract for convenience is based on an improperly considered protest and should be retracted for that reason alone.\u201d  Protest at 8.  The agency substantively responded to this allegation in the agency report .

W here, as here,  an agency \nprovides a detailed response to a protester \u2019s assertions and the protester fails to rebut \nor otherwise substantively address the agency \u2019s arguments in its comments, the \nprotester provides us with no basis to conclude that the agency \u2019s position with respect \nto the issue in question is unreasonable or improper.   4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3(i)(3); C2C \nInnovative Sols., Inc ., B-416289, B -416289.2, July 30, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 269 at 6.

Protest at 5- 7.  The VA responds, explaining \nthat the protester\u2019s proposal was found to be technically unacceptable, in part, becaus e \nTaylor Made\u2019s prior experience references were not completed within five years of solicitation issuance.  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer\u2019s Reevaluation Determination at 1.  The protester argues that the solicitation did not require all prior experience \nreferences to be completed within five years of the issuance of the RFP.  Protest at 6.   \n Relevant here, the RFP\u2019s first technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation experience) required the following:  \n \nThe Offeror shall demonstrate proof of experience as the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract.  Included in these routes[,] specific criteria need to be submitted as proof of \nexperience:  \n \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a continuous basis along \na designated route \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis  \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least two concurrent shuttle routes having a minimum passenger capacity of 18 or greater.  \n\u2022 Proof of operating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-\nambulatory access equipment  \n RFP at 152.  Additionally, offerors were asked to provide the \u201c[l]ocation and brief description of the work[,] including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting method within the last five (5) years.\u201d   Id.   \n Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references  with its proposal, one performed \nfor the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , and one performed for the \nVA.  AR, Exh. 7, Protester\u2019s Proposal at 20.  Taylor made does not challenge the \nagency\u2019s conclusion that the CMS contract  did not meet all route requirements listed in \nthe RFP.  MOL at 9 n. 3; see generally Protest .  Instead, the gravamen of the \nprotester\u2019s arguments focuses on challenging the agency\u2019s determination that the VA contract reference did not meet the requirements of the technic al subfactor.   Page 5 B-423117.3   \nAs noted above, in reevaluating the protester\u2019s proposal, the contracting officer determined that the protester had failed to meet the solicitation\u2019s prior experience requirements, as Taylor Made\u2019s \u201c[t]echnical proposal did not provide the location and brief description of the work including the building use and contracting method within the \nlast five (5) years . . . in its proposal to demonstrate its large- scale shuttle transportation \nexperience.\u201d  AR, Exh. 10, Contracting Officer\u2019s Reevaluation Determinat ion at 1; see \nRFP at 152.  We address, first, the protester\u2019s challenge to the requirement that the submitted prior experience be performed within the last five years.  \n  Mandatory Language  \n In arguing that its proposal met the solicitation\u2019s prior experience requirements --and \nthus was not technically unacceptable--Taylor Made contends that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation is unreasonable.  In this regard, the protester makes a multi -prong challenge.  First, Taylor Made argues that the solicitation did not \u201cmandate \nthat all experience must be limited to the past 5 years\u201d because the RFP did not use the \u201ctype of mandatory language [like] \u2018must\u2019 in limiting the types of experience that could be considered under Subfactor 1.\u201d  Protest at 6.  We find this contention to be without merit because the protester conveniently disregards the word \u201cshall\u201d in the subfactor\u2019s requirement.  See RFP at 152 (\u201cThe Offeror shall  demonstrate proof of experience as \nthe sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes . .  .\u201d) (emphasis added).  As our decisions have explained, the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory, and not permissive in nature.

As such, the solicitation \nexpressly mandated that an offeror submit a prior experience reference that met the solicitation requirements, provide the location and brief description of work for that experience, and that the reference be completed within the last five years.  \n  Reasonable Interpretation \n Next, the protester argues that the only reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cwithin t he \nlast five (5) years \u201d is that some-- rather than all --referenced projects needed to be \ncompleted within five years of the issuance of the solicitation.  Protest at 6 (\u201cThe only \nreasonable interpretation is just that a bidder must provide some information to satisfy \nSection 1.1.  A reasonable bidder would not understand this to be a blanket, 5- year \ncutoff of experience . . .\u201d).  Where a dispute exists as to a solicitation \u2019s actual \nrequirements, we will first examine the plain language of the solicitation.   Sikorsky \nAircraft Corp., B -416027, B -416027.2, May 22, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6  177 at 11.   When  a \nprotester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretati on must be \nconsistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner.   PAE \nAviation & Tech. Servs., LLC , B-418828.3, Mar. 17, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  153 at 9.    \n  Page 6 B-423117.3  Here, we find the agency \u2019s interpretation of the solicitation reasonable, and the \nprotester \u2019s interpretation not reasonable.  The RFP stated:  \u201c Provide location and brief \ndescription of the work including the building use (i.e. Medical Facility) and contracting \nmethod within the last five (5) years. \u201d  RFP at 152.  The solicitation clearly advised \nofferors that they should provide the location and description of work for the experience references submitted.  Id. at 152.  The only reasonable reading of this l anguage is that \nthe agency intended offerors to submit those location and work descriptions for each reference submitted.  Further, we find that the only reasonable reading of the phrase \u201cwithin the last five (5) years ,\u201d is that the phrase modifies what comes before it in the \nsentence.  See Kevcon, Inc. , B-406024.3,  June 18, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  221 at 6- 7 \n(finding that term at end of sentence modified the whole sentence).  As such, we find \nthat the provision is most reasonably read as requiring an offeror to s ubmit references, \neach performed within the last five years, that detailed the location of performance and a description of the work performed.  \n When read as a whole, it is clear from the requirements of this technical subfactor (large scale shuttle transportation services) that the agency wanted offerors to demonstrate prior experience that was both relevant and recent.  With respect to relevance,  the \nsubfactor required offerors to demonstrate experience performing \u201cas the sole contractor for at least 8 separate and concurrent routes on a single contract,\u201d that met the specified criteria ( e.g., \u201coperating at least one shuttle with handicap or non-\nambulatory access equipment\u201d ).  RFP at 152.  For recency, the subfactor required \nrelevant prior experience to have been performed \u201cwithin the last five (5) years.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder the protester\u2019s interpretation, offerors would be able to meet the subfactor\u2019s requirement by submitting one experience reference that was relevant --i.e., met the \nlisted criteria such as \u201coperating at least one shuttle on a 24 hour basis\u201d --and another \nexperience reference that met the recency requirement of being within five years.  Ev en \nif we agreed with the protester\u2019s interpretation--which we do not --this interpretation \nwould require giving no effect to the requirement that the demonstrated experience be \u201con a single contract.\u201d  RFP at 152.  Accordingly, we find the protester\u2019s inter pretation to \nbe unreasonable when the solicitation is read as a whole and giving effect to the plain language of the provision.  PAE Aviation & Tech. Servs., LLC, supra at 9-10. \n  Well- Written Proposal  \n Finally, the protester argues that its proposal  did, in fact, demonstrate that performance \nwas completed within the 5 -year timeframe .  Taylor Made alleges that there had been \nmodifications and extensions made to contracts it held with the VA for transportation services, and as result, performance had been extended beyond March of 2019.  Protest  at 5-6. \n Here, the VA issued the solicitation on May 14, 2025.  COS at 1.  As such, any prior experience references submitted by offerors were required to be completed after May 14, 2019, to be considered completed \u201cwithin the last five (5) years.\u201d  The only \ninform ation Taylor Made presented in its proposal, however, demonstrates the last \npossible date of completion of its VA shuttle transportation contract was March of 2019.   Page 7 B-423117.3  See AR, Exh. 7, Protester\u2019s Proposal at 20.  Specifically, Taylor Made\u2019s proposal clearly \nstates that \u201cContract End\u201d for the VA contract was \u201c03\/2019.\u201d4  Id.  Further, none of the \ncontract numbers associated with performance of the VA contract that were explicitly \nidentified in the proposal indicated that performance extended beyond March of 2019.  Id. at 17; MOL at 11.  While the protester also cites to multiple examples of contract \nextensions in its protest, the record demonstrates that such references were not \nincluded in Taylor Made\u2019s proposal, nor did those references pertain to the protester\u2019s \nshuttle transportation experience.  MOL at  11 (noting, among others, that modification of \ncontract cited in protest pertained to the provision of sedan services, rather than shuttle transportation services, and was not evaluated by contracting officer because reference \nwas not included in protester\u2019s proposal).   \n \nIn reviewing protests of alleged evaluations and source selections, our Office examines \nthe record to determine whether the agency judgment was reasonable and in accord with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws.  T -C Transcription, \nInc., B-401470.2, Feb. 16, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6 50 at 4.  It is an offeror \u2019s responsibility to \nsubmit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly \ndemonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by t he \nprocuring agency.  In this regard, an offeror must affirmatively demonstrate the merits of its proposal, which is at risk of rejection if the offeror fails to do so.  Id.    \n On the record before us, we find nothing on the face of the protester\u2019s proposal informed the agency that the listed VA contracts were performed within five years of \nsolicitation issuance.

As such, the agency was reasonable in terminating the contract that was initially awarded to Taylor Made, because an unacceptable proposal cannot form the basis for award.\n5  \n \n4 Although Taylor Made submitted two prior experience references (CMS and VA) to \nmeet the first technical subfactor requirements, the protester listed several contract numbers as part of its VA experience reference.

Agency Report (AR), Tab C, RFQ amend. 0005 at 1; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 3.  FEMA issued the RFQ to obtain technical assista nce with response, recovery, and other disaster operations missions \nunder the Office of Response and Recovery (ORR).

COS at 1.           The BPA would be established with the vendor offering the best value to the government considering the following factors listed in descending order of importance:  technical and management approach (factor 1); capability of proposed key personnel \nand staff ing plan (factor 2); past performance (factor 3); price (factor 4); and \nsubcontracting plan (factor 5).  RFQ at 5, 13.  As relevant here, the technical and management approach factor had two subfactors:  concept paper and demonstrated prior experience.  Id . at 5. \n Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, vendors were to explain their experience by addressing 11 topic areas.  RFQ at 7.  For each topic area, vendors were to provide one recent and relevant example of prior experience.  Id .  These examples \nwere to demonstrate experience with the corresponding statement of work (SOW) requirements as well.  Id.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the references \nvendors provided for each topic area and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id. at 8. Under the technical and management approach factor the agency \nwould assign a rating of high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.\n2  Id. \nat 10.   \n \n2 As described herein, during the evaluation process, the agency also assigned a rating \nof high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence to quotations under each technical subfactor.

Regarding topic areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10, the TET concluded that SCOR2E provided recent and relevant examples of its prior experience and demonstrated complete knowledge and understanding of the requirements.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2- 4.  \nRegarding topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11, the TET concluded that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation did \nnot do so.  Id. at 2 -3.  The TET concluded that, overall, it had some confidence in \nSCOR2E\u2019s ability to perform the contract based on its demonstrated prior experience.  Id. at 1.  Under the technical and management approach, SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \nultimately received a rating of some confidence.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.\n3   \n After evaluations were completed, the SSA determined that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was the second- highest rated after the quotation submitted by Cadmus.  AR, Tab G, ADM \nat 16.  Both vendors\u2019 prices were determined to be reasonable.  Id . at 7.   \n In comparing the quotations, the SSA noted that SCOR2E\u2019s failure to adequately address all the topic areas under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor gave the \nagency only some confidence in its ability to perform the work required.  The SSA noted \n \n3 Neither the TET\u2019s evaluation of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation under subfactor 2, nor the source \nselection authority\u2019s (SSA) decision in the ADM stated that SCOR2E, or any other \nvendor, received an \u201coverall\u201d technical rating.  However, the SSA wrote that Cadmus \u201cis the only offeror who received high confidence ratings for Factor 1 and Factor 2,\u201d \nimplying that the agency had only some confidence in SCOR2E\u2019s quotation under the technical factor overall.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.  This is consistent with how the parties have referred to SCOR2E\u2019s subfactor 2 rating and FEMA\u2019s impression of SCOR2E\u2019s \ntechnical approach overall during these proceedings.    Page 4 B-423315; B-423315.2  that, while SCOR2E understood the requirements and proposed a sound approach for \nmost of the topic areas, it did not provide experience that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements for topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Id. at 9.  Conversely, \nthe agency noted that Cadmus demonstrated a thorough understanding of the requirements and successfully addressed all topic areas.  Id. at 10.  The SSA further \nnoted that Cadmus\u2019s superior experience gave the agency significantly more confidence in its ability to perform which merited its price premium.  Id.  The SSA determined that \nCadmus provided the best value to the agency and made award to it on January 27, 2025.  COS at 7.  SCOR2E was notified the same day and this protest followed.   \n DISCUSSION  SCOR2E raises several challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation of quotations and asserts that the best -value determination is flawed.  We have considered all of SCOR2E\u2019s \narguments and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to federal supply schedule \nvendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition, we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation.  Nittany Bus. Movers, Inc., B -411856, Oct. 27, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 327 at 1-\n2.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the agency \u2019s evaluation, without more, is not \nsufficient to sustain the protest.  Id. \n Demonstrated Prior Experience  \n SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation under the \ndemonstrated prior experience subfactor.  Specifically, SCOR2E challenges the agency\u2019s findings under topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Protest at 8- 12.  SCOR2E asserts \nthat had it not been for these alleged errors, it would have received a technical rating equal with that of Cadmus and would have likely received award because of its lower price.  Id . at 12.  We have reviewed all SCOR2E\u2019s arguments and find that it has not \ndemonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable regarding any of the topic areas.  We address several examples below.   Again, under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the RFQ required vendors to provide one example of prior experience for each of the 11 topic areas, demonstrating their understanding of the corresponding SOW requirements.  RFQ at 7.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the vendors\u2019 references and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id . at 8.   \n As a first example, topic area 3 required prior experience with \u201ctangible results in Product Rollout Plan and Socialization Strategy Development.\u201d  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.3 of the SOW \u2013  support for product rollout plan and socialization strategy \ndevelopment \u2013 corresponded to this requirement.  Sub paragraph 4.3.1 of the SOW \nrequired that \u201cThe Contractor shall develop rollout plans for products including compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach  Page 5 B-423315; B-423315.2  and communication products, fact sheets and messaging to communicate key \nmessages for FEMA programs.\u201d  SOW at \u00b6 4.3.1.   \n In its evaluation of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation regarding topic 3, the agency noted the protester\u2019s quotation described creating products such as a guide for the agency, an internal Microsoft SharePoint site, and talking points for meetings and trainings.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  However, the agency \nnoted that these examples focused on internal products for the agency, like the guide, as opposed to external products for the public.  Id .  The agency also noted that the \nprotester\u2019s quotation did not provide enough information because it did not demonstrate \nexperience with rollout plans for products such as video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, and outreach and communication products.  Id .  The \nagency\u2019s findings regarding this topic contributed to the SSA\u2019s determination that it had some confidence in SCOR2E\u2019s prior experience.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 9, 15.    \n SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation regarding topic area 3 for several reasons.  The protester asserts that its quotation demonstrated experience with product rollout plans, and points to the portion of its quotation wherein it \ndescribes its experience developing, releasing, and rolling out an internal FEMA guide \u2013  \n\u201cA Guide to Community Engagement.\u201d  Protest at 8- 9; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  \nFactor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.  The protester next asserts that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  According to the protester, the evaluation implies that SCOR2E was supposed to provide a rollout plan for each type of media listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, which was not required.  Protest at 8; Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.\n4   \n \n4 The protester argues that the requirements in SOW \u00b6 4.3.1 are performance \nrequirements rather than evaluation criteria.  According to SCOR2E, this is made clear by the SOW\u2019s  reference to the \u201c Contractor \u201d as opposed to the vendor.  SOW at \u00b6 4.3.1.   \nSCOR2E asserts that because the SOW sets forth requirements that must be met during contract performance, it was improper for FEMA to evaluate its quotation for compliance with the SOW requirements.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.  This argument is without merit because the solicitation made clear that the agency would evaluate quotations based on how they demonstrated experience with the SOW requirements.  The RFQ stated several times that each of the 11 topic areas corresponded to requirements in the SO W.  RFQ at 7 -8.  The instructions for quotation \nsubmissions for subfactor 2 stated in part that a vendor \u201cshall demonstrate in the submission that it has recent and relevant demonstrated prior experience supporting the scope and complexity of requirements identified in the Statement of Work.\u201d  Id. at 7.  \nThe RFQ also stated that the evaluation of subfactor 2 \u201cis based on how well the demonstrated prior experience presented by the Offeror aligns with the eleven (11) topics listed above, which are all requirements listed in the SOW .\u201d  Id. at 8 (emphasis \nadded).  See MSN Servs., LLC,   B -414900, B -414900.2, et al. , Oct. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD \n\u00b6 310 at 6 (finding that where the SOW uses the term \u201ccontractor\u201d throughout the SOW when referring to numerous evaluation requirements, it would be unreasonable to \n(continued...)   Page 6 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated SCOR2E\u2019s quotation.  The agency \nfirst notes that the TET considered the protester\u2019s experience creating and rolling out \u201cA Guide to Community Engagement\u201d for FEMA in its evaluation, as well as the other portions of its quotation that mentioned the creation of an internal SharePoint site and \nconducting meetings and trainings.  MOL at 9- 10; AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  \nFactor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency asserts, however, that despite this prior experience, SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was still insufficient because it did not \ndemonstrate experience with a rollout plan that included compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach, or communication as required by the SOW.   MOL at 10.  The agency further asserts that the protester does not \ndispute that its quotation does not demonstrate this experience, but rather only asserts that it was not required to do so.  Id .  The agency argues that the RFQ expressly \nrequired vendors  to demonstrate their experience with all of the requirements in the \nSOW, like the various types of media listed in paragraph 4.3.1.  Id .   \n Here, we find that SCOR2E has not demonstrated that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  The record shows that the agency considered SCOR2E\u2019s prior experience creating the internal guide, as well as the SharePoint site and the trainings and meetings conducted.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 \nEvaluation at 2.  The record also shows that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation does not mention any other types of media, like those listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, and the protester has not asserted that its quotation addresses these other media types.  Id.; AR, Tab E, \nSCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.   \n Lastly, the agency\u2019s evaluation does not show that it expected the protester to describe \na rollout plan for each type of media.  As discussed above, producing rollout plans in general was a requirement of paragraph 4.3.1, but the evaluation criteria requir ed only \nthat vendors describe one experience example per topic area.  RFQ at 7.  More to the point, the agency did not in fact find that the protester\u2019s quotation lacked rollout plans, rather; it found that the nature of the experience was limited to supporting internal communication as opposed to external media or communications.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (noting that \u201cThe offeror did not \ndemonstrate the SOW requirement of \u2018compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach & communication products. . . .  Their response focuses more on internal products and the development of a guide as opposed to development of an external media or communications product.\u201d).  The protester does not directly dispute this finding, as a result, this protest ground is denied.  \n As another example, topic area 6 required prior experience with \u201ctangible results in Policy and Procedures Development.\u201d  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.6 of the SOW \u2013 policy \nand procedures development \u2013  corresponded to this requirement, which included four \n \ninterpret the solicitation\u2019s use of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d as indicating performance requirements because the solicitation advised vendors that their quotations needed to address the SOW requirements at issue and the agency would be precluded from evaluating any aspect of a vendor\u2019s technical capability).    Page 7 B-423315; B-423315.2  sub paragraphs.  The sub paragraphs listed several requirements, including that the \ncontractor support the development of policies and procedures in several ways:  by collaborating with various stakeholders, supporting the development of associated materia ls in accordance with various formatting guidelines and other requirements, \nsupporting the development of the plan of action milestones, and facilitating meetings.  SOW at \u00b6\u00b6 4.6.1 -4.6.4.  \n In its evaluation of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation regarding topic area 6, the agency determined that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cprovided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.\u201d  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency then referred to several \nparts of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation supporting this conclusion:  \u201cThe offeror mentioned \u2018including a policy and procedure review\u2019.  \u2018Supported [Field Operations Directorate] in development of the FEMA Strategic Recruitment Plan (SRP) by providing organized, \nstructured meetings and activities with actionable outcomes . . .\u2019 (pages three to four).\u201d  Id. \n SCOR2E asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation unreasonably ignored information in its quotation.  SCOR2E asserts that its quotation discusses the development of a FEMA policy and procedure and mentioned facilitating meetings.  Protest at 12; AR, Tab E, SCOR2 E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 3- 4.  The agency responds that the \nexample cited by SCOR2E was considered by the agency and cited in the evaluation.  The agency also responds that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation does not contain details that the agency failed to consider.  The agency asserts the protester\u2019s argument amounts to nothing other than disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment that its quotation lacked \nsufficient detail.  MOL at 12.      \n Here, we agree that SCOR2E has failed to show that the evaluation is unreasonable.  As the agency notes, the portions of the quotation SCOR2E claims the agency ignored are specifically cited in the evaluation record as the basis for the agency\u2019s conclusion that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was too broad.  Compare AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  \nFactor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (the agency states that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cprovided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter,\u201d citing to pages three and four of SCOR2E\u2019s \nquotation) with Protest at 12 (where SCOR2E argues that the agency ignored the \ninformation on pages three and four of its quotation).  The protester does not cite to any other portions of its quotation to support its claim that its quotation is sufficiently specific.  As a result, the protester\u2019s arguments amount to disagreement with the agency\u2019s \njudgment, as the protester has not shown that the agency\u2019s conclusions were illogical or unsupported by the record, but simply asserts that the portions of its quotation that the agency found to be broad should be read as adequately addressing the requirements.  Int\u2019l Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. , B-419737.3, Dec. 20, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 85 at 6.  \n As another example, topic area 8 required prior experience with \u201ctangible results in Program Analysis, Assessment and Management.\u201d  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.8 of the SOW \u2013 support for program analysis, assessment, management and reports \u2013  Page 8 B-423315; B-423315.2  corresponded to this requirement.  This section of the SOW contained 21 subtasks, \nsuch as implementing ORR programs by analyzing and assessing program data, conducting performance management and analytical studies, and analyzing existing program data and producing reports.  SOW at \u00b6\u00b6 4.8.8, 4.8.11- 4.8.14, 4.8.19- 4.8.21.   \n In evaluating SCOR2E\u2019s quotation under topic area 8, the agency found that it did not demonstrate an understanding of program analysis and assessment.  The agency stated that the examples in SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cfocused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.\u201d  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 \nSubfactor 2 Evaluation at 3.  The agency quoted the following portions of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation as supporting its conclusion:  \u201c \u2018Our team identified trends that were discussed in a Leadership Alignment Session, Future- State Visioning Workshop and Prioritization \nFramework and Workshop with [hazard mitigation assistance] leadership. (3) Guidehouse used its expertise and knowledge of FEMA to develop four guiding \nprinciples for the hybrid work envi ronment .  . .\u2019 (page five).\u201d  Id. at 3.   \n SCO2E asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation is unreasonable because there was no requirement in the RFQ or the SOW for \u201cexternal experience\u201d or \u201cevaluating the success of the program,\u201d and therefore the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Protest at 10- 11; Comments & Supp. Protest at 5.  The protester also argues that even \nif it was required to demonstrate this external -facing experience, it did so, as its \nquotation described experience related to FEMA stakeholders, customers, and local and state government partners.  Protest at 11.   \n The agency responds that it did not apply unstated evaluation criteria and contends that \nthe protester\u2019s argument is based on a misreading of the evaluation findings.  The agency explains that its note that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation focused \u201cinternally\u201d refers to its \nquotation\u2019s focus on internal processes as opposed to tangible results and did not imply that there was an external experience or focus requirement.  MOL at 14.  The agency further explains that its note regarding \u201cevaluating the success of the program\u201d also referred to SCOR2E\u2019s quotation\u2019s failure to describe the tangible results from its program analysis.  Id .  The agency further responds that the protester has not asserted \nthat its quotation demonstrates the success of a program or discusses tangible results, and therefore the protester has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  Id .   \n We agree with the agency that the protester has not demonstrated the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  The record shows that the agency\u2019s explanation of the evaluator\u2019s notes is consistent with the evaluator\u2019s notes as stated in the evaluation.   In \nits evaluation the agency cited to the portions of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation that describe a guide produced for internal use by FEMA staff and an internal leadership training, and the agency noted that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cfocused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.\u201d  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 \nEvaluation at 3; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 5.  The \nagency\u2019s note that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cfocused internally rather than evaluating the succe ss of the program,\u201d considered with the portions of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation the  Page 9 B-423315; B-423315.2  agency chose to cite, shows that the agency was referring to the protester\u2019s \ndemonstration of internal products as opposed to discussing tangible results as asserted by the agency.  As a result, the record does not support the protester\u2019s allegation that t he agency applied unstated evaluation criteria such as external \nexperience or evaluating the success of the program.  Moreover, the protester has not refuted the agency\u2019s conclusion that its quotation does not discuss tangible results for this topic area and the record shows that the relevant portion of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation does not discuss the tangible results or describe an evaluation of the success of the firm\u2019s cited guide and training.  AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at \n4-5.  As a res ult, the protester has given us no basis to question the evaluation in this \nregard.  \n Price Realism  \n SCOR2E next asserts that the agency improperly performed a price realism analysis, which was not provided for by the solicitation.  In support of its argument, SCOR2E focuses on a statement by the SSA in the best -value determination concluding that \nCadmus\u2019 s \u201csuperior technical solution conformed to all solicitation requirements to \ninclude prior technical experience that conveyed to pricing experience of the same and\/or similar type of FEMA work.\u201d  AR, Tab G, ADM at 16.  SCOR2E asserts that this language is evidence that the awardee\u2019s higher price was a positive discriminator in the agency\u2019s view, effectively penalizing SCOR2E for having a lower price.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 9.  By considering price in this way, SCOR2E asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluati on was tantamount to a price realism analysis.  Id .  SCOR2E also asserts that \nthe agency performed an unequal price realism analysis because it did not credit \nSCOR2E for its prior technical experience with FEMA and corresponding pricing experience.  Id. at 10.   \n The agency responds that the protester misconstrues the one sentence in the best -\nvalue determination.  The agency contends the determination instead shows that prices were evaluated solely for fairness and reasonableness in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. MOL at 4- 5. \n The record does not support the protester\u2019s assertion that the agency performed a price realism analysis.  The purpose of a price realism evaluation is to determine whether proposed or quoted prices are so low that they are not realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a lack of clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; or are not consistent with the methods of performance described in the vendor\u2019s technical proposal.  Ventera Corp. , B-418871, B -418871.2, Oct. 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 345 at 7.  \nThe sentence quoted by the protester does not show that the awardee\u2019s higher price was considered a positive discriminator, let alone imply that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was downgraded for having a lower price.  In fact, the agency does not reference ei ther \nfirm\u2019s price in the sentence.  The agency\u2019s comment does nothing more than acknowledge that the awardee\u2019s technical approach conformed to the solicitation requirements and note that the awardee\u2019s work experience with FEMA includes  Page 10 B-423315; B-423315.2  experience with the price for such work.  The challenged statement refers to experience \nand does not convey a view about either firm\u2019s actual price.   \n The only consideration of price in the best -value determination was reflected in the \nagency\u2019s conclusion that both SCOR2E\u2019s and Cadmus\u2019s prices were fair and reasonable.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 7.  Because the protester\u2019s interpretation of the agency\u2019s comment does not withstand logical scrutiny, we deny this aspect of the protest.

Best-Value Determination  \n Finally, SCOR2E also asserts the agency made a flawed best -value determination for \ntwo reasons .\n5  SCOR2E asserts the agency \u201cdownplayed the price premium\u201d for \nCadmus\u2019s quotation because the agency determined there was a 22.3 percent price difference between the quotations, when in fact \u2013  according to SCOR2E \u2013  the \ndifference is closer to 30 percent.\n6  SCOR2E also asserts the determination does not \nreflect any actual analysis.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8.   \n Both these claims are belied by the record.  As already stated, in reviewing protests of an agency\u2019s source selection decision in procurements conducted under the Federal \nSupply Schedule (FSS) procedures of FAR subpart  8.4, we do not conduct a new \nevaluation or substitute our judgement for that of the agency.   22nd Century Techs., \nInc., B-422659.5, B -422659.6, Jan. 14, 2025, 2025 CPD \u00b6 28 at 4.  Rather, we will \nreview the record to ensure the agency \u2019s evaluation and award decision were \nreasonable and consis tent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement \nlaws and regulations.   Id.  Procurements conducted using FSS procedures provide for a \nstreamlined procurement process with minimal documentation requirements.   Id.   \n Regardless of the percentages referred to, the record shows that the agency was aware of and considered the actual prices proposed by the vendors and the difference between them in weighing the prices against the technical merits.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 16- 17.  Further, the record shows that the SSA analyzed and weighed the \ntechnical merits of both quotations.  For example, the agency expressly compared the \n \n5 SCOR2E also asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the \nalleged flaws in the technical evaluation.

Agency Report (AR), Tab C, RFQ amend. 0005 at 1; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 3.  FEMA issued the RFQ to obtain technical assista nce with response, recovery, and other disaster operations missions \nunder the Office of Response and Recovery (ORR).  AR, Tab D, Statement of Work (SOW) at 2; Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3.  The ORR provides guidance and oversight for the coordination and delivery of support to those suffering from natural disasters and other emergencies.  FEMA, Office of Response and Recovery, https:\/\/www.fema.gov\/about\/offices\/ response- recovery  (last visited May 9, 2025).  \nTechnical assistance is needed to help ORR personnel guide and oversee the response to these disasters.  COS at 1.           The BPA would be established with the vendor offering the best value to the government considering the following factors listed in descending order of importance:  technical and management approach (factor 1); capability of proposed key personnel \nand staff ing plan (factor 2); past performance (factor 3); price (factor 4); and \nsubcontracting plan (factor 5).  RFQ at 5, 13.  As relevant here, the technical and management approach factor had two subfactors:  concept paper and demonstrated prior experience.  Id . at 5. \n Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, vendors were to explain their experience by addressing 11 topic areas.  RFQ at 7.  For each topic area, vendors were to provide one recent and relevant example of prior experience.  Id .  These examples \nwere to demonstrate experience with the corresponding statement of work (SOW) requirements as well.  Id.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the references \nvendors provided for each topic area and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id. at 8. Under the technical and management approach factor the agency \nwould assign a rating of high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence.\n2  Id. \nat 10.   \n \n2 As described herein, during the evaluation process, the agency also assigned a rating \nof high confidence, some confidence, or low confidence to quotations under each technical subfactor.

Page 3 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency received quotations from seven vendors.  COS at 3.  The evaluation results \nfor SCOR2E and Cadmus were as follows:  \n \n SCOR2E  Cadmus  \nTechnical and \nManagement Approach:  Some  High \n      Concept  Paper        High High \n      Demonstrated Prior  \n      Experience  Some  High \nCapability of Proposed \nKey Personnel and \nStaffing Plan  High High \nPast Performance  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nSubcontracting Plan  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nPrice  $64,080,276  $82,357,522  \n AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 7.  \n Under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the technical evaluation team (TET) noted the qualities of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation that raised or lowered its expectation that SCOR2E would successfully perform the contract.  Regarding topic areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10, the TET concluded that SCOR2E provided recent and relevant examples of its prior experience and demonstrated complete knowledge and understanding of the requirements.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2- 4.  \nRegarding topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11, the TET concluded that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation did \nnot do so.  Id. at 2 -3.  The TET concluded that, overall, it had some confidence in \nSCOR2E\u2019s ability to perform the contract based on its demonstrated prior experience.  Id. at 1.  Under the technical and management approach, SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \nultimately received a rating of some confidence.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.\n3   \n After evaluations were completed, the SSA determined that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was the second- highest rated after the quotation submitted by Cadmus.  AR, Tab G, ADM \nat 16.  Both vendors\u2019 prices were determined to be reasonable.  Id . at 7.   \n In comparing the quotations, the SSA noted that SCOR2E\u2019s failure to adequately address all the topic areas under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor gave the \nagency only some confidence in its ability to perform the work required.  The SSA noted \n \n3 Neither the TET\u2019s evaluation of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation under subfactor 2, nor the source \nselection authority\u2019s (SSA) decision in the ADM stated that SCOR2E, or any other \nvendor, received an \u201coverall\u201d technical rating.  However, the SSA wrote that Cadmus \u201cis the only offeror who received high confidence ratings for Factor 1 and Factor 2,\u201d \nimplying that the agency had only some confidence in SCOR2E\u2019s quotation under the technical factor overall.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 17.  This is consistent with how the parties have referred to SCOR2E\u2019s subfactor 2 rating and FEMA\u2019s impression of SCOR2E\u2019s \ntechnical approach overall during these proceedings.    Page 4 B-423315; B-423315.2  that, while SCOR2E understood the requirements and proposed a sound approach for \nmost of the topic areas, it did not provide experience that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements for topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Id. at 9.  Conversely, \nthe agency noted that Cadmus demonstrated a thorough understanding of the requirements and successfully addressed all topic areas.  Id. at 10.  The SSA further \nnoted that Cadmus\u2019s superior experience gave the agency significantly more confidence in its ability to perform which merited its price premium.  Id.  The SSA determined that \nCadmus provided the best value to the agency and made award to it on January 27, 2025.  COS at 7.  SCOR2E was notified the same day and this protest followed.   \n DISCUSSION  SCOR2E raises several challenges to the agency\u2019s evaluation of quotations and asserts that the best -value determination is flawed.  We have considered all of SCOR2E\u2019s \narguments and find that none provide us with a basis to sustain the protest.  We note at the outset that w here, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to federal supply schedule \nvendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition, we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation.  Nittany Bus. Movers, Inc., B -411856, Oct. 27, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 327 at 1-\n2.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the agency \u2019s evaluation, without more, is not \nsufficient to sustain the protest.  Id. \n Demonstrated Prior Experience  \n SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation under the \ndemonstrated prior experience subfactor.  Specifically, SCOR2E challenges the agency\u2019s findings under topic areas 3, 6, 8, and 11.  Protest at 8- 12.  SCOR2E asserts \nthat had it not been for these alleged errors, it would have received a technical rating equal with that of Cadmus and would have likely received award because of its lower price.  Id . at 12.  We have reviewed all SCOR2E\u2019s arguments and find that it has not \ndemonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable regarding any of the topic areas.  We address several examples below.   Again, under the demonstrated prior experience subfactor, the RFQ required vendors to provide one example of prior experience for each of the 11 topic areas, demonstrating their understanding of the corresponding SOW requirements.  RFQ at 7.  This subfactor would be evaluated based on the vendors\u2019 references and how well vendors demonstrated their experience.  Id . at 8.   \n As a first example, topic area 3 required prior experience with \u201ctangible results in Product Rollout Plan and Socialization Strategy Development.\u201d  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.3 of the SOW \u2013  support for product rollout plan and socialization strategy \ndevelopment \u2013 corresponded to this requirement.  Sub paragraph 4.3.1 of the SOW \nrequired that \u201cThe Contractor shall develop rollout plans for products including compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach  Page 5 B-423315; B-423315.2  and communication products, fact sheets and messaging to communicate key \nmessages for FEMA programs.\u201d  SOW at \u00b6 4.3.1.   \n In its evaluation of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation regarding topic 3, the agency noted the protester\u2019s quotation described creating products such as a guide for the agency, an internal Microsoft SharePoint site, and talking points for meetings and trainings.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  However, the agency \nnoted that these examples focused on internal products for the agency, like the guide, as opposed to external products for the public.  Id .  The agency also noted that the \nprotester\u2019s quotation did not provide enough information because it did not demonstrate \nexperience with rollout plans for products such as video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, and outreach and communication products.  Id .  The \nagency\u2019s findings regarding this topic contributed to the SSA\u2019s determination that it had some confidence in SCOR2E\u2019s prior experience.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 9, 15.    \n SCOR2E asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation regarding topic area 3 for several reasons.  The protester asserts that its quotation demonstrated experience with product rollout plans, and points to the portion of its quotation wherein it \ndescribes its experience developing, releasing, and rolling out an internal FEMA guide \u2013  \n\u201cA Guide to Community Engagement.\u201d  Protest at 8- 9; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  \nFactor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.  The protester next asserts that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  According to the protester, the evaluation implies that SCOR2E was supposed to provide a rollout plan for each type of media listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, which was not required.  Protest at 8; Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.\n4   \n \n4 The protester argues that the requirements in SOW \u00b6 4.3.1 are performance \nrequirements rather than evaluation criteria.  According to SCOR2E, this is made clear by the SOW\u2019s  reference to the \u201c Contractor \u201d as opposed to the vendor.  SOW at \u00b6 4.3.1.   \nSCOR2E asserts that because the SOW sets forth requirements that must be met during contract performance, it was improper for FEMA to evaluate its quotation for compliance with the SOW requirements.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3.  This argument is without merit because the solicitation made clear that the agency would evaluate quotations based on how they demonstrated experience with the SOW requirements.  The RFQ stated several times that each of the 11 topic areas corresponded to requirements in the SO W.  RFQ at 7 -8.  The instructions for quotation \nsubmissions for subfactor 2 stated in part that a vendor \u201cshall demonstrate in the submission that it has recent and relevant demonstrated prior experience supporting the scope and complexity of requirements identified in the Statement of Work.\u201d  Id. at 7.  \nThe RFQ also stated that the evaluation of subfactor 2 \u201cis based on how well the demonstrated prior experience presented by the Offeror aligns with the eleven (11) topics listed above, which are all requirements listed in the SOW .\u201d  Id. at 8 (emphasis \nadded).  See MSN Servs., LLC,   B -414900, B -414900.2, et al. , Oct. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD \n\u00b6 310 at 6 (finding that where the SOW uses the term \u201ccontractor\u201d throughout the SOW when referring to numerous evaluation requirements, it would be unreasonable to \n(continued...)   Page 6 B-423315; B-423315.2  The agency responds that it reasonably evaluated SCOR2E\u2019s quotation.  The agency \nfirst notes that the TET considered the protester\u2019s experience creating and rolling out \u201cA Guide to Community Engagement\u201d for FEMA in its evaluation, as well as the other portions of its quotation that mentioned the creation of an internal SharePoint site and \nconducting meetings and trainings.  MOL at 9- 10; AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  \nFactor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency asserts, however, that despite this prior experience, SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was still insufficient because it did not \ndemonstrate experience with a rollout plan that included compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach, or communication as required by the SOW.   MOL at 10.  The agency further asserts that the protester does not \ndispute that its quotation does not demonstrate this experience, but rather only asserts that it was not required to do so.  Id .  The agency argues that the RFQ expressly \nrequired vendors  to demonstrate their experience with all of the requirements in the \nSOW, like the various types of media listed in paragraph 4.3.1.  Id .   \n Here, we find that SCOR2E has not demonstrated that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation.  The record shows that the agency considered SCOR2E\u2019s prior experience creating the internal guide, as well as the SharePoint site and the trainings and meetings conducted.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 \nEvaluation at 2.  The record also shows that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation does not mention any other types of media, like those listed in SOW paragraph 4.3.1, and the protester has not asserted that its quotation addresses these other media types.  Id.; AR, Tab E, \nSCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 2.   \n Lastly, the agency\u2019s evaluation does not show that it expected the protester to describe \na rollout plan for each type of media.  As discussed above, producing rollout plans in general was a requirement of paragraph 4.3.1, but the evaluation criteria requir ed only \nthat vendors describe one experience example per topic area.  RFQ at 7.  More to the point, the agency did not in fact find that the protester\u2019s quotation lacked rollout plans, rather; it found that the nature of the experience was limited to supporting internal communication as opposed to external media or communications.  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (noting that \u201cThe offeror did not \ndemonstrate the SOW requirement of \u2018compelling video products, publications, brochures, infographics, webinars, outreach & communication products. . . .  Their response focuses more on internal products and the development of a guide as opposed to development of an external media or communications product.\u201d).  The protester does not directly dispute this finding, as a result, this protest ground is denied.  \n As another example, topic area 6 required prior experience with \u201ctangible results in Policy and Procedures Development.\u201d  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.6 of the SOW \u2013 policy \nand procedures development \u2013  corresponded to this requirement, which included four \n \ninterpret the solicitation\u2019s use of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d as indicating performance requirements because the solicitation advised vendors that their quotations needed to address the SOW requirements at issue and the agency would be precluded from evaluating any aspect of a vendor\u2019s technical capability).    Page 7 B-423315; B-423315.2  sub paragraphs.  The sub paragraphs listed several requirements, including that the \ncontractor support the development of policies and procedures in several ways:  by collaborating with various stakeholders, supporting the development of associated materia ls in accordance with various formatting guidelines and other requirements, \nsupporting the development of the plan of action milestones, and facilitating meetings.  SOW at \u00b6\u00b6 4.6.1 -4.6.4.  \n In its evaluation of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation regarding topic area 6, the agency determined that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cprovided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.\u201d  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2.  The agency then referred to several \nparts of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation supporting this conclusion:  \u201cThe offeror mentioned \u2018including a policy and procedure review\u2019.  \u2018Supported [Field Operations Directorate] in development of the FEMA Strategic Recruitment Plan (SRP) by providing organized, \nstructured meetings and activities with actionable outcomes . . .\u2019 (pages three to four).\u201d  Id. \n SCOR2E asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation unreasonably ignored information in its quotation.  SCOR2E asserts that its quotation discusses the development of a FEMA policy and procedure and mentioned facilitating meetings.  Protest at 12; AR, Tab E, SCOR2 E Quotation - Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 3- 4.  The agency responds that the \nexample cited by SCOR2E was considered by the agency and cited in the evaluation.  The agency also responds that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation does not contain details that the agency failed to consider.  The agency asserts the protester\u2019s argument amounts to nothing other than disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment that its quotation lacked \nsufficient detail.  MOL at 12.      \n Here, we agree that SCOR2E has failed to show that the evaluation is unreasonable.  As the agency notes, the portions of the quotation SCOR2E claims the agency ignored are specifically cited in the evaluation record as the basis for the agency\u2019s conclusion that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was too broad.  Compare AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  \nFactor 1 Subfactor 2 Evaluation at 2 (the agency states that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cprovided a broad response and does not demonstrate acceptable knowledge and understanding of the subject matter,\u201d citing to pages three and four of SCOR2E\u2019s \nquotation) with Protest at 12 (where SCOR2E argues that the agency ignored the \ninformation on pages three and four of its quotation).  The protester does not cite to any other portions of its quotation to support its claim that its quotation is sufficiently specific.  As a result, the protester\u2019s arguments amount to disagreement with the agency\u2019s \njudgment, as the protester has not shown that the agency\u2019s conclusions were illogical or unsupported by the record, but simply asserts that the portions of its quotation that the agency found to be broad should be read as adequately addressing the requirements.  Int\u2019l Ctr. for Language Studies, Inc. , B-419737.3, Dec. 20, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 85 at 6.  \n As another example, topic area 8 required prior experience with \u201ctangible results in Program Analysis, Assessment and Management.\u201d  RFQ at 7.  Paragraph 4.8 of the SOW \u2013 support for program analysis, assessment, management and reports \u2013  Page 8 B-423315; B-423315.2  corresponded to this requirement.  This section of the SOW contained 21 subtasks, \nsuch as implementing ORR programs by analyzing and assessing program data, conducting performance management and analytical studies, and analyzing existing program data and producing reports.  SOW at \u00b6\u00b6 4.8.8, 4.8.11- 4.8.14, 4.8.19- 4.8.21.   \n In evaluating SCOR2E\u2019s quotation under topic area 8, the agency found that it did not demonstrate an understanding of program analysis and assessment.  The agency stated that the examples in SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cfocused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.\u201d  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 \nSubfactor 2 Evaluation at 3.  The agency quoted the following portions of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation as supporting its conclusion:  \u201c \u2018Our team identified trends that were discussed in a Leadership Alignment Session, Future- State Visioning Workshop and Prioritization \nFramework and Workshop with [hazard mitigation assistance] leadership. (3) Guidehouse used its expertise and knowledge of FEMA to develop four guiding \nprinciples for the hybrid work envi ronment .  . .\u2019 (page five).\u201d  Id. at 3.   \n SCO2E asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluation is unreasonable because there was no requirement in the RFQ or the SOW for \u201cexternal experience\u201d or \u201cevaluating the success of the program,\u201d and therefore the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Protest at 10- 11; Comments & Supp. Protest at 5.  The protester also argues that even \nif it was required to demonstrate this external -facing experience, it did so, as its \nquotation described experience related to FEMA stakeholders, customers, and local and state government partners.  Protest at 11.   \n The agency responds that it did not apply unstated evaluation criteria and contends that \nthe protester\u2019s argument is based on a misreading of the evaluation findings.  The agency explains that its note that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation focused \u201cinternally\u201d refers to its \nquotation\u2019s focus on internal processes as opposed to tangible results and did not imply that there was an external experience or focus requirement.  MOL at 14.  The agency further explains that its note regarding \u201cevaluating the success of the program\u201d also referred to SCOR2E\u2019s quotation\u2019s failure to describe the tangible results from its program analysis.  Id .  The agency further responds that the protester has not asserted \nthat its quotation demonstrates the success of a program or discusses tangible results, and therefore the protester has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  Id .   \n We agree with the agency that the protester has not demonstrated the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  The record shows that the agency\u2019s explanation of the evaluator\u2019s notes is consistent with the evaluator\u2019s notes as stated in the evaluation.   In \nits evaluation the agency cited to the portions of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation that describe a guide produced for internal use by FEMA staff and an internal leadership training, and the agency noted that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cfocused internally rather than evaluating the success of the program.\u201d  AR, Tab F, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 \nEvaluation at 3; AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at 5.  The \nagency\u2019s note that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation \u201cfocused internally rather than evaluating the succe ss of the program,\u201d considered with the portions of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation the  Page 9 B-423315; B-423315.2  agency chose to cite, shows that the agency was referring to the protester\u2019s \ndemonstration of internal products as opposed to discussing tangible results as asserted by the agency.  As a result, the record does not support the protester\u2019s allegation that t he agency applied unstated evaluation criteria such as external \nexperience or evaluating the success of the program.  Moreover, the protester has not refuted the agency\u2019s conclusion that its quotation does not discuss tangible results for this topic area and the record shows that the relevant portion of SCOR2E\u2019s quotation does not discuss the tangible results or describe an evaluation of the success of the firm\u2019s cited guide and training.  AR, Tab E, SCOR2E Quotation -  Factor 1 Subfactor 2 at \n4-5.  As a res ult, the protester has given us no basis to question the evaluation in this \nregard.  \n Price Realism  \n SCOR2E next asserts that the agency improperly performed a price realism analysis, which was not provided for by the solicitation.  In support of its argument, SCOR2E focuses on a statement by the SSA in the best -value determination concluding that \nCadmus\u2019 s \u201csuperior technical solution conformed to all solicitation requirements to \ninclude prior technical experience that conveyed to pricing experience of the same and\/or similar type of FEMA work.\u201d  AR, Tab G, ADM at 16.  SCOR2E asserts that this language is evidence that the awardee\u2019s higher price was a positive discriminator in the agency\u2019s view, effectively penalizing SCOR2E for having a lower price.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 9.  By considering price in this way, SCOR2E asserts that the agency\u2019s evaluati on was tantamount to a price realism analysis.  Id .  SCOR2E also asserts that \nthe agency performed an unequal price realism analysis because it did not credit \nSCOR2E for its prior technical experience with FEMA and corresponding pricing experience.  Id. at 10.   \n The agency responds that the protester misconstrues the one sentence in the best -\nvalue determination.  The agency contends the determination instead shows that prices were evaluated solely for fairness and reasonableness in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. MOL at 4- 5. \n The record does not support the protester\u2019s assertion that the agency performed a price realism analysis.  The purpose of a price realism evaluation is to determine whether proposed or quoted prices are so low that they are not realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a lack of clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; or are not consistent with the methods of performance described in the vendor\u2019s technical proposal.  Ventera Corp. , B-418871, B -418871.2, Oct. 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 345 at 7.  \nThe sentence quoted by the protester does not show that the awardee\u2019s higher price was considered a positive discriminator, let alone imply that SCOR2E\u2019s quotation was downgraded for having a lower price.  In fact, the agency does not reference ei ther \nfirm\u2019s price in the sentence.  The agency\u2019s comment does nothing more than acknowledge that the awardee\u2019s technical approach conformed to the solicitation requirements and note that the awardee\u2019s work experience with FEMA includes  Page 10 B-423315; B-423315.2  experience with the price for such work.  The challenged statement refers to experience \nand does not convey a view about either firm\u2019s actual price.   \n The only consideration of price in the best -value determination was reflected in the \nagency\u2019s conclusion that both SCOR2E\u2019s and Cadmus\u2019s prices were fair and reasonable.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 7.  Because the protester\u2019s interpretation of the agency\u2019s comment does not withstand logical scrutiny, we deny this aspect of the protest.

Best-Value Determination  \n Finally, SCOR2E also asserts the agency made a flawed best -value determination for \ntwo reasons .\n5  SCOR2E asserts the agency \u201cdownplayed the price premium\u201d for \nCadmus\u2019s quotation because the agency determined there was a 22.3 percent price difference between the quotations, when in fact \u2013  according to SCOR2E \u2013  the \ndifference is closer to 30 percent.\n6  SCOR2E also asserts the determination does not \nreflect any actual analysis.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 8.   \n Both these claims are belied by the record.  As already stated, in reviewing protests of an agency\u2019s source selection decision in procurements conducted under the Federal \nSupply Schedule (FSS) procedures of FAR subpart  8.4, we do not conduct a new \nevaluation or substitute our judgement for that of the agency.   22nd Century Techs., \nInc., B-422659.5, B -422659.6, Jan. 14, 2025, 2025 CPD \u00b6 28 at 4.  Rather, we will \nreview the record to ensure the agency \u2019s evaluation and award decision were \nreasonable and consis tent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement \nlaws and regulations.   Id.  Procurements conducted using FSS procedures provide for a \nstreamlined procurement process with minimal documentation requirements.   Id.   \n Regardless of the percentages referred to, the record shows that the agency was aware of and considered the actual prices proposed by the vendors and the difference between them in weighing the prices against the technical merits.  AR, Tab G, ADM at 3, 16- 17.  Further, the record shows that the SSA analyzed and weighed the \ntechnical merits of both quotations.  For example, the agency expressly compared the \n \n5 SCOR2E also asserts that the best -value determination is flawed because of the \nalleged flaws in the technical evaluation.

Protest challenging the agency \u2019s evaluation of quotations  is denied where the \nevaluation was reasonable, even- handed, and consistent with the stated evaluation \ncriteria.  2. Protest contending the agency\u2019s failure, as part of its corrective action, to engage in exchanges with the protester constituted unequal discussions is denied where the agency\u2019s conduct was consistent with the terms of the solicitation and the protester  \ncannot demonstrate competitive prejudice.  \nDECISION  \n Mobomo LLC, a small business of Gaithersburg, Maryland, protests the issuance of an order to ResolveSoft Inc., a small business of Elkridge, Maryland, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 1305M324Q0367, issued by the Department of Commerce, \nNational Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for web modernization and \nmaintenance services.  The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of quotations and conduct of exchanges . \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on August 9, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4 (Federal Supply Schedules), to small DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.

RFQ at 1- 3.  \nNOAA sought support services to  maintain and enhance the National Marine Fisheries \nService flagship website,  www. fisheries.noaa.gov .  AR, Tab 4, Performance Work \nStatement (PWS) at 4.  \nThe solicitation advised that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, \nconsidering three non- price factors:  (1)  technical approach; (2) staffing and \nmanagement approach\/key personnel; and (3) experience.  RFQ at 65.  The RFQ \nexplained that the non- price factors were of equal importance and, when combined, \nwere significantly more important than price.  Id . at 64- 65.  NOAA would apply one of \nthree adjectival confidence ratings for each of the non- price evaluation factors:  high \nconfidence; some confidence; and low confidence.

Mobomo filed the instant protest on March 10.  \n \nDISCUSSION  Mobomo marshals several challenges to the agency\u2019s conduct of the procurement.  In this regard, the protester contends the agency\u2019s evaluation of its quotation across the non-price factors was flawed, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation.  Specifically, Mobomo argues NOAA improperly identified a number of \nquotation features that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence that the firm could successfully perform the contract and applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Moreover, the protest er asserts the evaluation was unequal, where NOAA applied a much harsher \nstandard to its review of Mobomo\u2019s quotation as compared to ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation.  The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate quotations in a manner  consistent with the RFQ\u2019s evaluation scheme.  Additionally, the protester \nargues the agency erred by not also engaging in exchanges with Mobomo.  For the reasons that follow, we find no basis to sustain the protest.\n3  \n Technical Evaluation  \n Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and \nconducts a competition for the issuance of an order or establishment of a blanket purchase agreement , we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation \n \n3 Mobomo raises other collateral allegations, and although our decision does not \nspecifically address every argument presented, we have considered each argument and find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.   For example, under the \nstaffing and management approach\/key personnel factor, vendors were required to \u201cexplain how the proposed labor categories from its  GSA Schedule contract are \nequivalent to the labor categories specified in the PWS  in terms of position \nduties\/responsibilities and qualifications[.]\u201d  RFQ at 60.  The protester argues the agency improperly concluded that Mobomo\u2019s proposed labor categories and corresponding qualifications referenced in its quotation \u201care not fully equivalent to the required qualifications outlined in the PWS [.]\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 6.   \nHowever, based on our review of the record, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s evaluation findings.  Indeed, it is not immediately ascertainable from the chart in the protester\u2019s quotation whether the positions cited in the evaluation report do, in fact, meet  the minimum requirements as established in the PWS.  Compare AR, Tab 10, \nMobomo Technical Quotation at 19- 21 (Mobomo\u2019s crosswalk with identified \nqualifications), with PWS at 15 -19 (requiring specific levels of education and\/or \nexperience for each position).  It is a vendor \u2019s responsibility to submit  a well- written \nquotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .

OPTIMUS Corp. , \nB-400777, Jan. 26, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 33 at 4.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the \nagency \u2019s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was \nunreasonable.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2.   \n We have reviewed each of Mobomo\u2019s  arguments concerning the agency \u2019s evaluation \nunder the non- price  factors , and, as reflected in the following representative examples, \nwe find no basis to sustain the protes t.  \n First, Mobomo challenges the agency\u2019s assessment of items that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence in the protester\u2019s quotation under the technical approach factor.  Relevant here, the technical approach factor was to be \u201c evaluated to assess the degree \nto which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, \nand experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation. \u201d  \nRFQ at 65.  Both vendors were assigned a \u201csome confidence\u201d rating under this factor.  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  For Mobomo\u2019s quotation, while NOAA found \nseveral technical features that increased the agency\u2019s confidence of successful performance, NOAA found five elements that were identified to decrease the agency\u2019s confidence, al l of which Mobomo challenges in this protest.  \n As one example, under the PWS\u2019s project management task (task 1), the successful vendor will be expected to, among other things, \u201c[m]anage software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to existing systems or processes. \u201d  PWS at  6.  In \nits evaluation, the agency stated that Mobomo\u2019s quotation \u201c does not address a strategy \nor method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions [.]\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The protester finds fault with the \nagency\u2019s  conclusions, contending its quotation did manifest a cogent strategy for \nsoftware upgrades with little disruption.  Protest at 24- 25; Comments and Supp. Protest \nat 18- 20; 2nd Supp. Comments at 16- 17.\n4  Specifically, Mobomo points to its four -\nphased risk management plan, use of the Jira software application for software upgrade tracking and documentation, and its use of continuous integration and deployment.  See  \nAR, Tab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 8- 10.   \n However, the agency disagrees that these features, and Mobomo\u2019s overall plan, were sufficiently detailed to warrant a different evaluation finding.  The technical evaluation team (TET) chair provided a declaration to support the agency\u2019s findings, in which he \n \n4 Following briefing on Mobomo\u2019s supplemental protest allegation, our Office asked for \nadditional briefing from the parties.  Electronic Protest Docketing System (EPDS) No. 24.  We refer to this round of briefing as the \u201c2nd. Supplemental.\u201d   Page 6 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  noted that the protester\u2019s plan lacked specificity.  TET Chair Dec. at 2.  For example, \nwith respect to its four -phased risk management plan, the TET chair explains that \nMobomo\u2019s plan is \u201csimply too high -level\u201d and does not sufficiently describe how \nMobomo\u2019s approach would minimize disruptions.  Id .  Similarly, with respect to \ncontinuous integration and development, the TET chair provides that while these are important tools, these \u201cprimarily focus on code quality and security, not on ensuring a smooth and disruption- free upgrade. \u201d  Id. \n Moreover, with respect to Mobomo\u2019s use of Jira, the TET chair explains that this web-based tool is essentially a service request tracking notebook.  Id .  But, while \u201c[t] aking \nnotes is necessary to do, \u201d the TET chair provides that reliance on Jira \u201c is a lackluster \nresponse to this requirement \u201d because it is not wholly responsive to meet the agency\u2019s \nneed, nor was its use explained with sufficient detail with respect to minimizing disruptions.  Id . at 2 -3.  Mobomo disagrees with the TET\u2019s assessment; in the \nprotester\u2019s view, \u201c Jira is not just  a web- based tracking tool; rather, it is a project \nmanagement platform used for  quality assurance.\u201d  2nd Supp. Comments at  15-16.  In \nthis regard, the protester\u2019s protest submissions argue that Jira represents a multi -step \nprocess that \u201censures quality and minimizes disruptions during software upgrades.\u201d  Id. \nat 16.    However, given the lack of these supporting details presented in Mobomo\u2019s quotation (rather than as further explained in the protester\u2019s briefs during this protest), we cannot conclude the agency\u2019s evaluation determinations are unreasonable.  Compare AR, \nTab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 9 (noting only the use Jira to \u201ctrack, monitor, \nand plan for software upgrades, minimizing disruption to existing systems and ensuring \ntimely updates \u201d) with 2nd Supp. Comments at 15- 17 (providing significant detail on how \nJira would be utilized for software upgrades).  As addressed above, it is a vendor\u2019s responsibility to submit a quotation with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. , \nsupra.  To the extent Mobomo\u2019s protest submissions attempt to more clearly articulate its proposed technical approach, our review is limited to the quotation, as submitted, as contracting agencies are not responsible for evaluating information that is  not included \nin a quotation.  Patriot Def. Grp., LLC , B-418720.3, Aug.  5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 265 at 9.  \n Second, Mobomo also suggests NOAA\u2019s evaluation conclusions under the technical approach factor reflect unequal treatment among vendors, where the agency applied exacting scrutiny to the protester\u2019s quotation yet acted with insouciance when it came to Resol veSoft\u2019s alleged lack of similar detail.  That is, to prevail on an allegation of \ndisparate treatment, a protester must show that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation in a different manner than another quotation that was substantively indistinguishable or nearly identical.  CGI Fed., Inc. , B-423041 et al. , Jan.13, 2025, \n2025 CPD \u00b6 26 at 12.  \n As one example of alleged unequal treatment, Mobomo points to NOAA\u2019s acceptance of the alleged mere mention of the use of Jira in ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation but required significant detailed explanations when it came to Mobomo\u2019s use of Jira.  2nd Supp.  Page 7 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Comments at  16.  The protester\u2019s comparison is inapposite.  To this point, the record \nreflects that NOAA found benefit in ResolveSoft\u2019s overall quality control and assurance \n(task 3) plan, to include its approach to \u201cdefect tracking\u201d, where the awardee explained it would \u201cuse Jira for defect tracking, linking defects to user stories to reduce recurrence \nby [DELETED] [percent].\u201d  AR, Tab 14, ResolveSoft Technical Quotation at 12; see also \nAR, Tab  23, Evaluation Report at 9 (explaining several features of Res olveSoft\u2019s \nquotation that increased confidence in successful performance, to include that the firm\u2019s quotation \u201c mentions using Jira for defect tracking, ensuring that defects are linked to \nuser stories to reduce recurrence by [DELETED] [percent]\u201d which \u201c highlights a \nstructured approach to defect documentation and issue tracking. \u201d).   \n On the other hand, the agency faulted Mobomo\u2019s quotation because while it also proposed to use Jira, the protester failed to explain how such use would allow for the management of \u201c software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to \nexisting systems or processes \u201d as required under PWS task  1.  PWS at  6; see also TET \nChair Dec. at 2- 3 (explaining that Jira is primarily a tool for service tracking as opposed \nto implementation).  Thus, the agency credited the awardee for its proposed use of Jira in connection with defect tracking under PWS task 3, while awarding a weakness for the \nprotester\u2019s failure to adequately explain the use of the tool in connection with management of software upgrades under PWS task 1; the differences in the agency\u2019s evaluati on reasonably stem from differences in the quotations.  \n Similarly, the protester\u2019s argument of disparate treatment concerning the vendors\u2019 capability maturity model integration (CMMI) level 3 certifications fails to provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.\n5  Mobomo contends NOAA relied on this certification to \n\u201cmitigate\u201d a weakness assigned to ResolveSoft, yet did not do so for a \u201csimilar\u201d weakness assigned to the protester\u2019s quotation.  As an initial matter, the record reflects the CMMI certification was fo und to increase confidence of successful performance for \nboth Mobomo and ResolveSoft.\n6  Notwithstanding that both vendors were positively \ncredited for the same quotation feature, the protester complains that it was unreasonable for the agency to also address the awardee\u2019s certification as helping to mitigate an assessed weakness, while not similarly mentioning the protester\u2019s certification as helping to mitigate one of the protester\u2019s assessed weaknesses.  2nd \n \n5 The CMMI Institute appraises organizations at levels from 0 to 5 to characterize that \norganization\u2019s capability and performance.  See https:\/\/cmmiinstitute.com\/learning\/ \nappraisals\/levels  (last visited May 26, 2025).  The CMMI institute characterizes maturity \nlevel 3 as \u201cproactive rather than reactive\u201d where \u201c[o]rganization- wide standards provide \nguidance across projects, programs, and portfolios.\u201d  Id . \n6 Specifically, both offerors received nearly identical strengths because NOAA \nconcluded that CMMI level 3 practices meant \u201cthe vendor has an organizational approach to development practices, which is relevant for project management and risk management (PWS  Task 1), technical solutions (Task 2), quality assurance and \nrequirements management (PWS Task 3), and product integration (PWS Task 5).\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  Thus, the record reflects that both offerors were similarly positively credited for their respective CMMI certifications.  Page 8 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Supp. Comments at 17- 18.  However, to whatever extent the record suggests that the \nagency considered ResolveSoft\u2019s CMMI level 3 certification, in this regard, it also makes \nclear that both offerors were similarly assessed weaknesses for providing inadequat e \ndetail in their responses to the PWS task 1 requirements, thus negating any alleged \u201cunequal\u201d treatment.  \n Specifically, Mobomo received a weakness because its quotation did \u201cnot address a strategy or method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions (PWS Task 1).\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The record reflects that ResolveSoft similarly received a weakness for its failure to provide adequate details \nwith respect to managing project risks under PWS task 1.  Id. at 9.  Although the \nawardee was positively evaluated based on its \u201ccomprehensive and carefully planned\u201d approach to project management and its approach to planning and task decomposition, \nthe agency noted concern with the lack of adequate detail in the awardee\u2019s plan to \u201cidentify risks, minimize the impact of unforeseen issues, respond to outages, or manage s oftware upgrades.\u201d  Id.  at 8-10.  The TET explained that ResolveSoft\u2019s CMMI \nlevel 3 certification \u201cindicates the use of processes that support effective risk management,\u201d and the quotation otherwise provided some software upgrade details under PWS task  7.  Id. at 10.   \n Fatal to the protester\u2019s argument, however, is that notwithstanding the foregoing potential mitigating points, the TET nevertheless assigned a weakness to ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation, specifically explaining that \u201c[t]he omission from Task 1 decreases the Gover nment\u2019s confidence that Team ResolveSoft can effectively manage project risks \nwith minimal intervention.\u201d  Id. at 10.  Accordingly, to whatever degree the agency \nconsidered the awardee\u2019s CMMI certification, it nevertheless assigned a weakness to the awarde e\u2019s quotation.  Thus, where both vendors were positively assessed for \npossessing CMMI certifications, and neither offeror avoided an adverse evaluation finding as a result of their certifications, the record fails to demonstrate that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unequal.  \n Next, Mobomo argues the agency, in contravention of the terms of the RFQ, failed to reasonably consider \u201cexperience\u201d in its evaluation of vendors\u2019 offered technical approaches under the first evaluation factor.  See Protest at 37- 38; 2nd Supp. \nComments at  27-28.  As noted above, under the technical approach factor, a vendor\u2019s \n\u201coverall technical approach will be evaluated to assess the degree to which the quote \ndemonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, and experience to \nsuccessfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation.\u201d (emphasis added).  \nThis evaluation factor was distinct from the third evaluation factor, which specifically evaluated vendors\u2019 prior experience.  RFQ at 65.  The protester contends NOAA, in its evaluation under the technical approach factor, overlooked the firm\u2019s \u201cunmatched track record in performing the RFQ requirements on behalf of NOAA under the incumbent  \ncontract [,]\u201d as well as its high marks for such performance in the Contractor \nPerformance Assessment  Reporting System (CPARS), and in turn failed to consider \nResolveSoft\u2019s alleged lack of relevant federal experience.  Protest at 37.  The protester\u2019s arguments unreasonably characterize the agency\u2019s contemporaneous  Page 9 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  evaluation record, which demonstrates that the agency reasonably considered offerors\u2019 \nrelevant experience as part of the technical approach factor.  \n Relevant here, the contemporaneous evaluation record unquestionably demonstrates that the agency, consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation scheme, considered vendors\u2019 respective experience as part of the technical approach evaluation.  Specifically, t he agency identified three aspects of Mobomo\u2019s prior experience that \nincreased the agency\u2019s confidence under the technical approach factor, including:  \n \n\u2022 As the incumbent, Mobomo has an understanding of and significant experience with NOAA Fisheries\u2019 processes, priorities, and organizational structure and the websites\u2019 infrastructure, codebase, \nand policies. . . .  \n \n\u2022 Mobomo\u2019s status as a Drupal Certified Partner, Acquia Community \nPartner, and member of the [Amazon Web Services] Partner Network \nincreases the Government\u2019s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, dev ops, and \nperformance monitoring. . . .  \n \n\u2022 Mobomo\u2019s experience with Drupal\u2019s multilingual modules and \nintegrating third- party translation services increases the Government\u2019s \nconfidence that they can successfully execute PWS Task 6 requirements related to page translations if the Government chooses to carry out that optional special project.  \n AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  \n For ResolveSoft, the agency positively noted that:  \u201cTeam ResolveSoft\u2019s bench of Acquia - and Drupal -certified developers and 20+ years of Drupal development \nexperience increases the Government\u2019s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, devops, and performance monitoring.\u201d  Id. at 9. \n Thus, the record demonstrates that --separate and apart from the evaluation of vendors\u2019 \nrespective experience under the experience evaluation factor --the agency also \nreasonably considered vendors\u2019 respective relevant experience under the technical approach factor.  To the extent that the protester raises additional discrete challenges to \nthe agency\u2019s evaluation of experience, we find no merit to those arguments.  \n For example, notwithstanding that the agency positively credited Mobomo for its incumbent experience under the technical approach factor (as noted above), the protester suggests that such a strength should have been afforded considerably more significance.   We disagree.  We have consistently explained that there is no \nrequirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or  Page 10 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent contractor.  Tuknik \nGov\u2019t Servs., LLC , B-422862.2, Dec. 30, 2024, 2025 CPD \u00b6 17 at  4. \n Similarly, the protester\u2019s allegation that ResolveSoft should have been downgraded for not having relevant federal experience fails to establish a basis on which to sustain the protest.  Nothing in the technical approach factor limited experience only to r elevant \nfederal  experience; rather, the agency was only to evaluate proffered experience to the \nextent it demonstrated the offeror\u2019s ability to successfully perform  the requirements \nstated within the solicitation .  See RFQ at 65.  Given the commercial nature of the \nsoftware at issue, it was not unreasonable for the agency to consider an offeror\u2019s general experience working with the software or platforms, regardless of whether the customer was a government or commercial entity.  In this regard, the experienc e \nevaluation factor specifically allowed for the submission of references for work performed for government agencies or commercial entities, and noted that in terms of relevance, the government was particularly interested in \u201cthe quoter\u2019s demonstrated experience with platforms, systems, methodology, and software identified in the PWS, or similarly related technology, including, but not limited to, Acquia Drupal PaaS, Akamai WAF\/CDN, Agile\/Scrum methodology, UX -driven design and development, and \ndata- driven decision making.\u201d  RFQ at 60.  The protester does not offer any reason why \nthe relevancy considerations for the technical approach factor should be read more restrictively than the relevancy requirements set forth under the experience evaluation factor.  \n As a final example of its challenges under the technical approach factor, the protester argues the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria where NOAA unreasonably \ninflated the importance of PWS task 3 (quality control and quality assurance) and task 5 (user experience, usability, design, and content support) in its evaluation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at 8- 14; Supp. Comments at 9- 14; 2nd Supp. Comments at 29- 34.  In \nthis regard, Mobomo contends that the RFQ did not provide for giving more weight to different tasks in the agency\u2019s evaluation yet the agency\u2019s best -value decision elevated \ntasks 3 and 5 above all others, which fundamentally skewed NOAA\u2019s selection decision.  Id.  Mobomo points to a specific portion of the agency\u2019s award decision in support of its \nargument:  \n \nAs the incumbent, Mobomo brings institutional knowledge and experience with [agency]  processes, priorities, and organizational structure, as well as \nthe website\u2019s infrastructure, codebase, and policies.  However, the current \nrequirement expands on and introduces requirements intended to enhance both service quality (user experience, website performance, and reliability) and product quality (code integrity, feature functionality, and technical performance),  which differ from the previous contract supported \nby Mobomo and reflect the project\u2019s more advanced state.  It is in meeting \nthese requirements that Mobomo is inferior to the other vendor.  \n AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13- 14. \n  Page 11 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement that an agency must evaluate \nquotations consistent with the terms of the solicitation and, while the evaluation of vendors\u2019 quotations generally is a matter within the procuring agency\u2019s discretion, our Office will question an agency\u2019s evaluation where it is unreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria, or undocumented.   Tantus Techs., Inc. , \nB-411608, B -411608.3, Sept. 14, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 299 at 6.   \n Contrary to the protester\u2019s contention, the record does not support Mobomo\u2019s assertion regarding the unfair weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 in the agency\u2019s evaluation under the technical approach factor.  First, the technical evaluation demonstrates the agency considered the positive and negative aspects of both vendors\u2019 quotations across all the PWS task areas.  See, e.g.,  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3 -4, 9-10.  Second, the \nrecord evidences that the source selection authority did highlight Mobomo\u2019s deficiencies, as compared to ResolveSoft, specifically with regard to elements of PWS \ntasks 3 and 5.  See e.g.,  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13 (noting that Mobomo\u2019s \u201c technical \napproach lacked clarity and details in several key aspects of the PWS, specifically in [tasks 3 and 5].\u201d).   \n However, the same paragraph cited by the protester as confirmation of impermissible weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 also highlights Mobomo\u2019s shortcomings in another PWS area, task 1 (project management).  Id . (identifying Mobomo\u2019s quotation as lacking \ndetail in how it would handle defect recurrence).  Thus, the record does not support a contention that NOAA was exclusively concerned with PWS tasks 3 and 5.  Third, and most relevant to our analysis, the mere f act that a source selection authority finds \ndiscri minators in some, but not all, of the evaluated tasks does not equate to the \nagency\u2019s consideration of those specific tasks above all others.  Indeed, in a best -value \nprocurement, particularly where technical factors are more important than price, an agenc y may focus on a particular discriminator, and merely highlighting a specific \naspect of a quotation in the selection decision does not, by itself, render the evaluation unreasonable.  See, e.g.,  SGT, Inc., B -405736,  B-405736.2 Dec. 27, 2011, 2012 CPD \n\u00b6 149 at 10; Teledyne Brown Eng\u2019 g, B-258078; B -258078.2, Dec. 6, 1994, 94- 2 CPD \n\u00b6 223 at 12- 13.  \n Next, turning to the agency\u2019s evaluation under the staffing and management approach\/key personnel factor, Mobomo challenges NOAA\u2019s evaluation of its key personnel, arguing the agency unreasonably found that the resumes for all three of the firm\u2019s key perso ns failed to demonstrate experience in several key PWS areas.  Protest \nat 39-48; Comments and Supp. Protest at 26- 32; Supp. Comments at 17- 18; 2nd Supp. \nComments at 34- 59.  Again, based upon our review of the record, we find nothing \nunreasonable with the agency\u2019s evaluation.  We address one representative example, below.  \n Vendors were required to submit resumes for three identified key persons:  (1) a w eb \nproject manager\/ scrum master ; (2) l ead developer\/ technical architect ; and (3) digital \nproduct analyst\/UX researcher .  RFQ at 13, 59- 60.  NOAA would evaluate, among other \nthings, \u201c the strength of  the proposed key personnel including education and  Page 12 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  professional certifications\/credentials \u201d as well as \u201c the currency, quality and depth of \nexperience of the proposed key personnel  working on similar projects. \u201d  RFQ at 65.  For \neach identified key personnel position, the PWS provided a bullet point list of primary \nresponsibilities.  See e.g., PWS at  14 (identifying 13 core areas the web project \nmanager\/scrum master would perform).   \n The agency\u2019s evaluation found several aspects of Mobomo\u2019s proposed web project manager\/scrum master that increase NOAA\u2019s confidence in successful performance of the contract.  See AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 4 (identifying several positive \naspects of the web project manager\u2019s resume and experience relevant to the subject PWS).  However, the evaluators also found that the web project manager\u2019s resume did not demonstrate \u201c experience in three responsibilities of the role that are important to the \nsuccess of project requirements and goals [.]\u201d  Id. at 5.  Specifically, the TET explained \nthat the project manager\/scrum master did not demonstrate experience to:  (1) m onitor \nand manage project risks throughout the development process , which \u201c directly relates to \nrisk management requirements \u201d; (2) o versee quality control and quality assurance \nprocesses , which was identified as \u201cc ritical to the successful execution of the approach \nMobomo presents []\u201d; and (3) o versee documentation of the website\u2019s architecture and \nconfigurations as well as project processes , a requirement for PWS tasks 1 and 3.  Id.; \nsee also PWS at  14. \n Mobomo contends these findings are in error.  Indeed, the protester argues while its proposed w eb project manager\/ scrum master \u2019s \u201cresume does not use the exact words \ncalled out in the Re- Evaluation  Summary, a complete review of his resume \ndemonstrates [he] has experience with each  of these three responsibilities .\u201d  Protest \nat 40.  In this regard, Mobomo argues the key person\u2019s experience managing a Drupal \nupgrade, oversight of daily scrums, experience using a process implementation indicator description (PI ID) to monitor project health, and maintenance of CMMI -\ncompliant documentation satisfy the PWS requirements.  2nd Supp. Comments at 34-41.   \n Our Office has consistently stated that it is a vendor\u2019s responsibility  to submit a well -\nwritten quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. Inc. , supra  at 5.  \nA vendor  risks having its quotation evaluated unfavorably where it fails to submit an \nadequately written quotation.   Id.   \n On this record, we find no evidence to suggest the agency\u2019s evaluation conclusions were unreasonable.  For example, concerning the web project manager\u2019s leading a Drupal upgrade, as explained by the TET chair in his declaration, \u201c software upgrade  \nrisk management and continuous risk management are related but different in scope and application.\u201d  TET Chair Dec. at 6.  Thus, \u201c[m] anaging a Drupal upgrade can \ndemonstrate some aspects  of risk management experience, but that experience alone \ndoes not fully  demonstrate risk management \u201d because \u201c[r]isk  management is an \nongoing, structured process. \u201d  Id.  Similarly, while Mobomo argues the key person\u2019s \nexperience overseeing daily scrum meetings demonstrates oversight of quality  Page 13 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  control\/assurance processes, the TET disagreed.  The TET chair explains scrum \nmeetings \u201ccan help surface quality -related issues and improve communication between \ndevelopers and testers,  [but] they do not constitute [quality control\/assurance] \noversight. \u201d  Id.  We find reasonable the agency\u2019s evaluation conclusions; Mobomo\u2019s \ndisagreement, without more, provides no basis to sustain the protest.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2. \n Exchanges  \n Following its initial evaluation of quotations, NOAA, having determined that ResolveSoft was the apparent successful vendor, entered into exchanges with the firm.  See  RFQ \nat 64 (\u201cOnce the Government determines the contractor that is the best -suited ( i.e., the \napparent  successful contractor), the Government reserves the right to communicate \nwith only that contractor to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a \ntask order with that contractor. \u201d).  The agency sought clarification concerning w here \ncertain subscription and hosting platform costs were included in ResolveSoft\u2019s price quotation.  Supp. COS at 10- 11.  ResolveSoft submitted a revised pricing quotation in \nresponse, resulting in an increase in price of approximately $[DELETED].  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 10.  Following Mobomo\u2019s initial protest, NOAA, as part of its corrective action, conducted a reevaluation of quotations, but did not engage in any additional exchanges with either the protester or ResolveSoft.  Id.   \n The protester challenges the agency\u2019s failure to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as part of its corrective action.  Mobomo agrees that NOAA was, consistent with the solicitation, permitted to conduct exchanges with ResolveSoft following the best suited \ndetermination made as part the initial evaluation of quotations.  However, the protester contends that once the agency agreed to undertake a new evaluation of quotations, \u201cResolveSoft was no longer the apparent awardee\u201d and \u201c[a]t that stage, the Agency was \nrequired to conduct leveling discussions with Mobomo to allow quotes to be evaluated \non an equal basis .\u201d  Comments and Supp. Protest at 4.  In this regard, Mobomo argues \nNOAA\u2019s exchanges with ResolveSoft constituted discussions, and such \u201c one-sided \ndiscussions tainted the reevaluation\u201d because \u201c NOAA permitted  ResolveSoft to address \nweaknesses identified by the Agency and submit a revised quote without  affording \nMobomo the opportunity to do the same.\u201d  Id. at 6.  See also Supp. Comments at 5- 9.  \nIn response, the agency contends its decision to engage in exchanges with ResolveSoft was reasonable, or, in the alternative, Mobomo suffered no competitive prejudice as a result of NOAA\u2019s failure to enter into exchanges with the protester.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MO L) at 2- 5. \n Where an agency chooses to conduct exchanges with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, the exchanges, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance in makin g this determination.  Aurotech, Inc. , B-413861.4, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 205 \nat 10.  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as \u201climited exchanges\u201d that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this \ncase, quotations), or to resolve minor clerical mistakes.  See FAR 15.306(a)(1),(2); Sky  Page 14 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Solutions, LLC , B-421139.2, B -421139.3, June 30, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 184 at 6.  In \ncontrast, under FAR part 15, discussions occur when an agency communicates with an \nofferor for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determining the acceptability of a proposal or quotation or provides the offeror with an opportunity to revise or modify its proposal or quotation.  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches, Inc. , B-418823.3, \nB-418823.4, Jan.  8, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 18 at 8.  \n We have previously resolved protests involving similarly worded solicitation provisions that allowed an agency to address any issues, including technical or price, only with the best-suited contractor, including in FAR subpart 8.4 procurements.  See, e.g., A Square \nGrp., LLC , B-421792.5, Apr. 11, 2025, 2025 CPD \u00b6  95 at 7 (denying protest ground \nalleging that the agency conducted unequal discussions pursuant to a similar solicitation provision in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement); Sky Solutions, LLC , supra at 6-7 (same); \nsee also VariQ -CV JV, LLC, B -418551, B -418551.3, June 15, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  196 \nat 18-20 (denying a similar challenge in a FAR subpart 16.5 procurement).  In those \ndecisions, which were protests challenging an agency\u2019s conduct of exchanges, we denied protest grounds alleging the agency conducted unequal discussions primarily on \nthe basis that the agency\u2019s actions in holding exchanges were consistent with the terms of the solicitation, while also noting that the procurements at issue were conducted under FAR procedures other than those found at FA R part 15.  See Sky Solutions , LLC, \nsupra at 7; VariQ -CV JV, LLC, supra at 20.   \n Mobomo\u2019s protest presents a novel factual scenario.   That is, rather than a challenge to \nthe propriety of exchanges with ResolveSoft following the agency\u2019s initial evaluation, the protester contends the agency was required to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as \npart of its corrective action, so to place the two firms on an equal competitive footing for the reevaluation.   Here, on this record, we conclude that Mobomo cannot demonstrate it \nwas competitively prejudiced by the agency\u2019s conduct.   See, e.g., Interfor US, Inc., \nB-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD \u00b6 19 at 7 (\u201cCompetitive prejudice is an essential \nelement of every viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a protest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency\u2019s actions arguably were improper.\u201d).  \n Several facts in the record lead us to this conclusion.   First, we note that the parties are \nseemingly in agreement that the solicitation permitted the exchanges NOAA engaged in with ResolveSoft, as the apparent awardee, following the agency\u2019s initial eval uation.   \nSee Supp. MOL at 2- 4; Supp. Comments at 6- 7.  Second,  the record demonstrates that \nResolveSoft, as a result of those exchanges, made changes to its pricing volume, but did not make changes to its technical quotation.  See  AR, Tab  24, ADD at 10.  I ndeed, \nthe agency\u2019s technical reevaluation was unaffected as a result of those pricing changes.  Third, the record demonstrates that both after the agency\u2019s initial evaluation of \nquotations, and after its reevaluation following its decision to take corrective action in response to Mobomo\u2019s initial protest, ResolveSoft was determined to be the best -suited \nvendor .  Id.  That is, the status quo ante prior to the agency\u2019s undertaking corrective \naction remained in effect; ResolveSoft endured as the best -suited v endor  even at a \nhigher price.   Finally, and as discussed more fully above, we find no basis to object to  Page 15 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  the agency\u2019s reevaluation conclusions, to include NOAA\u2019s evaluation of vendors\u2019 \ntechnical quotations, or  that ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation was technically superior to \nMobomo\u2019s quotation.  \n Under these unique facts, Mobomo cannot reasonably demonstrate it was prejudiced by \nthe agency\u2019s conduct .  Mobomo was not the best -suited vendor  following the initial \nevaluation, nor was it the best -suited vendor  following the agency\u2019s reevaluation.  Id.  \nThus, under the established terms of the solicitation, Mobomo was not eligible for exchanges with NOAA.   See Sky Solutions , supra at 7 (denying protest on basis that \nagency, having determined the awardee was the best -suited vendor, reasonably \nentered into exchanges with the firm).  Moreover, as the protester acknowledges, our \nOffice\u2019s decisions explain an agency may conduct exchanges solely with the best -suited \nvendor  so long as the agency \u201creasonably and fairly\u201d evaluates vendors\u2019 quotations.  \nComments at 6 (citing S2 Analytical Sols., LLC, B -422281.3, Dec. 20, 2024, 2024 CPD \n\u00b6 312 at 3).    \n Again, as developed more fully, above, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s underlying \nevaluation of quotations.   And finally, ResolveSoft, through exchanges, made no \nalterations to its technical quotation, and the firm\u2019s pricing changes had no impact on the underlying merits of the agency\u2019s reevaluation or tradeoff decision.  AR, Tab 24, \nADD at 10.  In sum:  Resolv eSoft\u2019s initial quotation was evaluated as technically \nsuperior; the exchanges had no bearing on ResolveSoft\u2019s technical quotation and were limited t o a single issue, resulting in a net increase to the awardee\u2019s proposed price; \nand ResolveSoft\u2019s unchanged, initial non- price quotation was confirmed as technically \nsuperior following the agency\u2019s reevaluation.  On this specific record, we find no basis to \nsustain the protest allegation.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of quotations and conduct of exchanges . \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on August 9, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4 (Federal Supply Schedules), to small DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.

RFQ at 65.  The RFQ \nexplained that the non- price factors were of equal importance and, when combined, \nwere significantly more important than price.  Id . at 64- 65.  NOAA would apply one of \nthree adjectival confidence ratings for each of the non- price evaluation factors:  high \nconfidence; some confidence; and low confidence.  Id . at 65.   \n Under the technical approach factor, quotations would be evaluated \u201c to assess the \ndegree to which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound \napproach to, and experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this \nsolicitation. \u201d  Id. at 65.

COS at 6.  Following its evaluation, NOAA identified ResolveSoft as the best -suited vendor and entered into exchanges with \nthe firm.  COS at 7.  Through these exchanges, ResolveSoft upwardly revised its price quotation.  AR, Tab 17, Exchanges with ResolveSoft at  1; AR, Tab 28, \nResolveSoft Pricing Revisions at 2.  NOAA issued the order to ResolveSoft on September 19.  COS at 8.  \n Mobomo filed a protest with our Office on October 3, challenging NOAA\u2019s evaluation of quotations.  On October 15, our Office dismissed Mobomo\u2019s protest as academic, based on the agency\u2019s stated intention to undertake corrective \naction; NOAA explained it wo uld \u201cre- evaluate the quotes it received in response \nto the solicitation and subsequently issue a new source selection decision.\u201d  \nMobomo LLC , B-423027, Oct. 15, 2024 (unpublished decision).   \n In implementing its corrective action, NOAA undertook a reevaluation of quotations, resulting in the following ratings for Mobomo\u2019s and ResolveSoft\u2019s quotations:  \n \n Mobomo  ResolveSoft  \nTechnical Approach  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  \nStaffing and Management \nApproach\/Key Personnel  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  \nExperience  Some Confidence  Some Confidence  \nTotal Evaluated Price  $11,030,164  $11,470,934  \n AR, Tab 24, Corrective Action Award Decision Document (ADD) at 12. \n NOAA found ResolveSoft \u2019s quotation to represent the best value to the agency, \n\u201cconsidering its technically superior approach, senior key personnel, and extensive \nexperience. \u201d  Id. at 16.  The agency further explained that \u201cResolveSoft\u2019s quote offers a \ntechnically superior, low risk option compared to Mobomo, and the technically superior  Page 4 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  features . . . are worth the slight price premium associated with ResolveSoft\u2019s quote. \u201d  \nId.  NOAA issued the task order to ResolveSoft  on or about February 26, 2025.  COS \nat 14.  Mobomo filed the instant protest on March 10.  \n \nDISCUSSION  Mobomo marshals several challenges to the agency\u2019s conduct of the procurement.  In this regard, the protester contends the agency\u2019s evaluation of its quotation across the non-price factors was flawed, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation.  Specifically, Mobomo argues NOAA improperly identified a number of \nquotation features that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence that the firm could successfully perform the contract and applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Moreover, the protest er asserts the evaluation was unequal, where NOAA applied a much harsher \nstandard to its review of Mobomo\u2019s quotation as compared to ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation.  The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably failed to evaluate quotations in a manner  consistent with the RFQ\u2019s evaluation scheme.  Additionally, the protester \nargues the agency erred by not also engaging in exchanges with Mobomo.  For the reasons that follow, we find no basis to sustain the protest.\n3  \n Technical Evaluation  \n Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to FSS vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and \nconducts a competition for the issuance of an order or establishment of a blanket purchase agreement , we will review the record to ensure that the agency \u2019s evaluation \n \n3 Mobomo raises other collateral allegations, and although our decision does not \nspecifically address every argument presented, we have considered each argument and find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.   For example, under the \nstaffing and management approach\/key personnel factor, vendors were required to \u201cexplain how the proposed labor categories from its  GSA Schedule contract are \nequivalent to the labor categories specified in the PWS  in terms of position \nduties\/responsibilities and qualifications[.]\u201d  RFQ at 60.  The protester argues the agency improperly concluded that Mobomo\u2019s proposed labor categories and corresponding qualifications referenced in its quotation \u201care not fully equivalent to the required qualifications outlined in the PWS [.]\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 6.   \nHowever, based on our review of the record, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s evaluation findings.  Indeed, it is not immediately ascertainable from the chart in the protester\u2019s quotation whether the positions cited in the evaluation report do, in fact, meet  the minimum requirements as established in the PWS.  Compare AR, Tab 10, \nMobomo Technical Quotation at 19- 21 (Mobomo\u2019s crosswalk with identified \nqualifications), with PWS at 15 -19 (requiring specific levels of education and\/or \nexperience for each position).  It is a vendor \u2019s responsibility to submit  a well- written \nquotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .

A protester \u2019s disagreement with the \nagency \u2019s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was \nunreasonable.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2.   \n We have reviewed each of Mobomo\u2019s  arguments concerning the agency \u2019s evaluation \nunder the non- price  factors , and, as reflected in the following representative examples, \nwe find no basis to sustain the protes t.  \n First, Mobomo challenges the agency\u2019s assessment of items that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence in the protester\u2019s quotation under the technical approach factor.  Relevant here, the technical approach factor was to be \u201c evaluated to assess the degree \nto which the quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, \nand experience to successfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation. \u201d  \nRFQ at 65.  Both vendors were assigned a \u201csome confidence\u201d rating under this factor.  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  For Mobomo\u2019s quotation, while NOAA found \nseveral technical features that increased the agency\u2019s confidence of successful performance, NOAA found five elements that were identified to decrease the agency\u2019s confidence, al l of which Mobomo challenges in this protest.  \n As one example, under the PWS\u2019s project management task (task 1), the successful vendor will be expected to, among other things, \u201c[m]anage software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to existing systems or processes. \u201d  PWS at  6.  In \nits evaluation, the agency stated that Mobomo\u2019s quotation \u201c does not address a strategy \nor method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions [.]\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The protester finds fault with the \nagency\u2019s  conclusions, contending its quotation did manifest a cogent strategy for \nsoftware upgrades with little disruption.  Protest at 24- 25; Comments and Supp. Protest \nat 18- 20; 2nd Supp. Comments at 16- 17.\n4  Specifically, Mobomo points to its four -\nphased risk management plan, use of the Jira software application for software upgrade tracking and documentation, and its use of continuous integration and deployment.  See  \nAR, Tab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 8- 10.   \n However, the agency disagrees that these features, and Mobomo\u2019s overall plan, were sufficiently detailed to warrant a different evaluation finding.  The technical evaluation team (TET) chair provided a declaration to support the agency\u2019s findings, in which he \n \n4 Following briefing on Mobomo\u2019s supplemental protest allegation, our Office asked for \nadditional briefing from the parties.  Electronic Protest Docketing System (EPDS) No. 24.  We refer to this round of briefing as the \u201c2nd. Supplemental.\u201d   Page 6 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  noted that the protester\u2019s plan lacked specificity.  TET Chair Dec. at 2.  For example, \nwith respect to its four -phased risk management plan, the TET chair explains that \nMobomo\u2019s plan is \u201csimply too high -level\u201d and does not sufficiently describe how \nMobomo\u2019s approach would minimize disruptions.  Id .  Similarly, with respect to \ncontinuous integration and development, the TET chair provides that while these are important tools, these \u201cprimarily focus on code quality and security, not on ensuring a smooth and disruption- free upgrade. \u201d  Id. \n Moreover, with respect to Mobomo\u2019s use of Jira, the TET chair explains that this web-based tool is essentially a service request tracking notebook.  Id .  But, while \u201c[t] aking \nnotes is necessary to do, \u201d the TET chair provides that reliance on Jira \u201c is a lackluster \nresponse to this requirement \u201d because it is not wholly responsive to meet the agency\u2019s \nneed, nor was its use explained with sufficient detail with respect to minimizing disruptions.  Id . at 2 -3.  Mobomo disagrees with the TET\u2019s assessment; in the \nprotester\u2019s view, \u201c Jira is not just  a web- based tracking tool; rather, it is a project \nmanagement platform used for  quality assurance.\u201d  2nd Supp. Comments at  15-16.  In \nthis regard, the protester\u2019s protest submissions argue that Jira represents a multi -step \nprocess that \u201censures quality and minimizes disruptions during software upgrades.\u201d  Id. \nat 16.    However, given the lack of these supporting details presented in Mobomo\u2019s quotation (rather than as further explained in the protester\u2019s briefs during this protest), we cannot conclude the agency\u2019s evaluation determinations are unreasonable.  Compare AR, \nTab 10, Mobomo Technical Quotation at 9 (noting only the use Jira to \u201ctrack, monitor, \nand plan for software upgrades, minimizing disruption to existing systems and ensuring \ntimely updates \u201d) with 2nd Supp. Comments at 15- 17 (providing significant detail on how \nJira would be utilized for software upgrades).  As addressed above, it is a vendor\u2019s responsibility to submit a quotation with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. , \nsupra.  To the extent Mobomo\u2019s protest submissions attempt to more clearly articulate its proposed technical approach, our review is limited to the quotation, as submitted, as contracting agencies are not responsible for evaluating information that is  not included \nin a quotation.  Patriot Def. Grp., LLC , B-418720.3, Aug.  5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 265 at 9.  \n Second, Mobomo also suggests NOAA\u2019s evaluation conclusions under the technical approach factor reflect unequal treatment among vendors, where the agency applied exacting scrutiny to the protester\u2019s quotation yet acted with insouciance when it came to Resol veSoft\u2019s alleged lack of similar detail.  That is, to prevail on an allegation of \ndisparate treatment, a protester must show that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation in a different manner than another quotation that was substantively indistinguishable or nearly identical.  CGI Fed., Inc. , B-423041 et al. , Jan.13, 2025, \n2025 CPD \u00b6 26 at 12.  \n As one example of alleged unequal treatment, Mobomo points to NOAA\u2019s acceptance of the alleged mere mention of the use of Jira in ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation but required significant detailed explanations when it came to Mobomo\u2019s use of Jira.  2nd Supp.  Page 7 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Comments at  16.  The protester\u2019s comparison is inapposite.  To this point, the record \nreflects that NOAA found benefit in ResolveSoft\u2019s overall quality control and assurance \n(task 3) plan, to include its approach to \u201cdefect tracking\u201d, where the awardee explained it would \u201cuse Jira for defect tracking, linking defects to user stories to reduce recurrence \nby [DELETED] [percent].\u201d  AR, Tab 14, ResolveSoft Technical Quotation at 12; see also \nAR, Tab  23, Evaluation Report at 9 (explaining several features of Res olveSoft\u2019s \nquotation that increased confidence in successful performance, to include that the firm\u2019s quotation \u201c mentions using Jira for defect tracking, ensuring that defects are linked to \nuser stories to reduce recurrence by [DELETED] [percent]\u201d which \u201c highlights a \nstructured approach to defect documentation and issue tracking. \u201d).   \n On the other hand, the agency faulted Mobomo\u2019s quotation because while it also proposed to use Jira, the protester failed to explain how such use would allow for the management of \u201c software upgrades in a timely manner and without disruptions to \nexisting systems or processes \u201d as required under PWS task  1.  PWS at  6; see also TET \nChair Dec. at 2- 3 (explaining that Jira is primarily a tool for service tracking as opposed \nto implementation).  Thus, the agency credited the awardee for its proposed use of Jira in connection with defect tracking under PWS task 3, while awarding a weakness for the \nprotester\u2019s failure to adequately explain the use of the tool in connection with management of software upgrades under PWS task 1; the differences in the agency\u2019s evaluati on reasonably stem from differences in the quotations.  \n Similarly, the protester\u2019s argument of disparate treatment concerning the vendors\u2019 capability maturity model integration (CMMI) level 3 certifications fails to provide a basis on which to sustain the protest.\n5  Mobomo contends NOAA relied on this certification to \n\u201cmitigate\u201d a weakness assigned to ResolveSoft, yet did not do so for a \u201csimilar\u201d weakness assigned to the protester\u2019s quotation.  As an initial matter, the record reflects the CMMI certification was fo und to increase confidence of successful performance for \nboth Mobomo and ResolveSoft.\n6  Notwithstanding that both vendors were positively \ncredited for the same quotation feature, the protester complains that it was unreasonable for the agency to also address the awardee\u2019s certification as helping to mitigate an assessed weakness, while not similarly mentioning the protester\u2019s certification as helping to mitigate one of the protester\u2019s assessed weaknesses.  2nd \n \n5 The CMMI Institute appraises organizations at levels from 0 to 5 to characterize that \norganization\u2019s capability and performance.  See https:\/\/cmmiinstitute.com\/learning\/ \nappraisals\/levels  (last visited May 26, 2025).  The CMMI institute characterizes maturity \nlevel 3 as \u201cproactive rather than reactive\u201d where \u201c[o]rganization- wide standards provide \nguidance across projects, programs, and portfolios.\u201d  Id . \n6 Specifically, both offerors received nearly identical strengths because NOAA \nconcluded that CMMI level 3 practices meant \u201cthe vendor has an organizational approach to development practices, which is relevant for project management and risk management (PWS  Task 1), technical solutions (Task 2), quality assurance and \nrequirements management (PWS Task 3), and product integration (PWS Task 5).\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3, 9.  Thus, the record reflects that both offerors were similarly positively credited for their respective CMMI certifications.  Page 8 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Supp. Comments at 17- 18.  However, to whatever extent the record suggests that the \nagency considered ResolveSoft\u2019s CMMI level 3 certification, in this regard, it also makes \nclear that both offerors were similarly assessed weaknesses for providing inadequat e \ndetail in their responses to the PWS task 1 requirements, thus negating any alleged \u201cunequal\u201d treatment.  \n Specifically, Mobomo received a weakness because its quotation did \u201cnot address a strategy or method for how software upgrades will be conducted in a way that minimizes disruptions (PWS Task 1).\u201d  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  The record reflects that ResolveSoft similarly received a weakness for its failure to provide adequate details \nwith respect to managing project risks under PWS task 1.  Id. at 9.  Although the \nawardee was positively evaluated based on its \u201ccomprehensive and carefully planned\u201d approach to project management and its approach to planning and task decomposition, \nthe agency noted concern with the lack of adequate detail in the awardee\u2019s plan to \u201cidentify risks, minimize the impact of unforeseen issues, respond to outages, or manage s oftware upgrades.\u201d  Id.  at 8-10.  The TET explained that ResolveSoft\u2019s CMMI \nlevel 3 certification \u201cindicates the use of processes that support effective risk management,\u201d and the quotation otherwise provided some software upgrade details under PWS task  7.  Id. at 10.   \n Fatal to the protester\u2019s argument, however, is that notwithstanding the foregoing potential mitigating points, the TET nevertheless assigned a weakness to ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation, specifically explaining that \u201c[t]he omission from Task 1 decreases the Gover nment\u2019s confidence that Team ResolveSoft can effectively manage project risks \nwith minimal intervention.\u201d  Id. at 10.  Accordingly, to whatever degree the agency \nconsidered the awardee\u2019s CMMI certification, it nevertheless assigned a weakness to the awarde e\u2019s quotation.  Thus, where both vendors were positively assessed for \npossessing CMMI certifications, and neither offeror avoided an adverse evaluation finding as a result of their certifications, the record fails to demonstrate that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unequal.  \n Next, Mobomo argues the agency, in contravention of the terms of the RFQ, failed to reasonably consider \u201cexperience\u201d in its evaluation of vendors\u2019 offered technical approaches under the first evaluation factor.  See Protest at 37- 38; 2nd Supp. \nComments at  27-28.  As noted above, under the technical approach factor, a vendor\u2019s \n\u201coverall technical approach will be evaluated to assess the degree to which the quote \ndemonstrates an adequate understanding of, sound approach to, and experience to \nsuccessfully perform  the requirements stated within this solicitation.\u201d (emphasis added).  \nThis evaluation factor was distinct from the third evaluation factor, which specifically evaluated vendors\u2019 prior experience.  RFQ at 65.  The protester contends NOAA, in its evaluation under the technical approach factor, overlooked the firm\u2019s \u201cunmatched track record in performing the RFQ requirements on behalf of NOAA under the incumbent  \ncontract [,]\u201d as well as its high marks for such performance in the Contractor \nPerformance Assessment  Reporting System (CPARS), and in turn failed to consider \nResolveSoft\u2019s alleged lack of relevant federal experience.  Protest at 37.  The protester\u2019s arguments unreasonably characterize the agency\u2019s contemporaneous  Page 9 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  evaluation record, which demonstrates that the agency reasonably considered offerors\u2019 \nrelevant experience as part of the technical approach factor.  \n Relevant here, the contemporaneous evaluation record unquestionably demonstrates that the agency, consistent with the solicitation\u2019s evaluation scheme, considered vendors\u2019 respective experience as part of the technical approach evaluation.  Specifically, t he agency identified three aspects of Mobomo\u2019s prior experience that \nincreased the agency\u2019s confidence under the technical approach factor, including:  \n \n\u2022 As the incumbent, Mobomo has an understanding of and significant experience with NOAA Fisheries\u2019 processes, priorities, and organizational structure and the websites\u2019 infrastructure, codebase, \nand policies. . . .  \n \n\u2022 Mobomo\u2019s status as a Drupal Certified Partner, Acquia Community \nPartner, and member of the [Amazon Web Services] Partner Network \nincreases the Government\u2019s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, dev ops, and \nperformance monitoring. . . .  \n \n\u2022 Mobomo\u2019s experience with Drupal\u2019s multilingual modules and \nintegrating third- party translation services increases the Government\u2019s \nconfidence that they can successfully execute PWS Task 6 requirements related to page translations if the Government chooses to carry out that optional special project.  \n AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3.  \n For ResolveSoft, the agency positively noted that:  \u201cTeam ResolveSoft\u2019s bench of Acquia - and Drupal -certified developers and 20+ years of Drupal development \nexperience increases the Government\u2019s confidence that they have the experience to perform the project requirements related to hosting, devops, and performance monitoring.\u201d  Id. at 9. \n Thus, the record demonstrates that --separate and apart from the evaluation of vendors\u2019 \nrespective experience under the experience evaluation factor --the agency also \nreasonably considered vendors\u2019 respective relevant experience under the technical approach factor.  To the extent that the protester raises additional discrete challenges to \nthe agency\u2019s evaluation of experience, we find no merit to those arguments.  \n For example, notwithstanding that the agency positively credited Mobomo for its incumbent experience under the technical approach factor (as noted above), the protester suggests that such a strength should have been afforded considerably more significance.   We disagree.  We have consistently explained that there is no \nrequirement that an incumbent be given extra credit for its status as an incumbent, or  Page 10 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  that an agency assign or reserve the highest rating for the incumbent contractor.  Tuknik \nGov\u2019t Servs., LLC , B-422862.2, Dec. 30, 2024, 2025 CPD \u00b6 17 at  4. \n Similarly, the protester\u2019s allegation that ResolveSoft should have been downgraded for not having relevant federal experience fails to establish a basis on which to sustain the protest.  Nothing in the technical approach factor limited experience only to r elevant \nfederal  experience; rather, the agency was only to evaluate proffered experience to the \nextent it demonstrated the offeror\u2019s ability to successfully perform  the requirements \nstated within the solicitation .  See RFQ at 65.  Given the commercial nature of the \nsoftware at issue, it was not unreasonable for the agency to consider an offeror\u2019s general experience working with the software or platforms, regardless of whether the customer was a government or commercial entity.  In this regard, the experienc e \nevaluation factor specifically allowed for the submission of references for work performed for government agencies or commercial entities, and noted that in terms of relevance, the government was particularly interested in \u201cthe quoter\u2019s demonstrated experience with platforms, systems, methodology, and software identified in the PWS, or similarly related technology, including, but not limited to, Acquia Drupal PaaS, Akamai WAF\/CDN, Agile\/Scrum methodology, UX -driven design and development, and \ndata- driven decision making.\u201d  RFQ at 60.  The protester does not offer any reason why \nthe relevancy considerations for the technical approach factor should be read more restrictively than the relevancy requirements set forth under the experience evaluation factor.  \n As a final example of its challenges under the technical approach factor, the protester argues the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria where NOAA unreasonably \ninflated the importance of PWS task 3 (quality control and quality assurance) and task 5 (user experience, usability, design, and content support) in its evaluation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at 8- 14; Supp. Comments at 9- 14; 2nd Supp. Comments at 29- 34.  In \nthis regard, Mobomo contends that the RFQ did not provide for giving more weight to different tasks in the agency\u2019s evaluation yet the agency\u2019s best -value decision elevated \ntasks 3 and 5 above all others, which fundamentally skewed NOAA\u2019s selection decision.  Id.  Mobomo points to a specific portion of the agency\u2019s award decision in support of its \nargument:  \n \nAs the incumbent, Mobomo brings institutional knowledge and experience with [agency]  processes, priorities, and organizational structure, as well as \nthe website\u2019s infrastructure, codebase, and policies.  However, the current \nrequirement expands on and introduces requirements intended to enhance both service quality (user experience, website performance, and reliability) and product quality (code integrity, feature functionality, and technical performance),  which differ from the previous contract supported \nby Mobomo and reflect the project\u2019s more advanced state.  It is in meeting \nthese requirements that Mobomo is inferior to the other vendor.  \n AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13- 14. \n  Page 11 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  It is a fundamental principle of federal procurement that an agency must evaluate \nquotations consistent with the terms of the solicitation and, while the evaluation of vendors\u2019 quotations generally is a matter within the procuring agency\u2019s discretion, our Office will question an agency\u2019s evaluation where it is unreasonable, inconsistent with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria, or undocumented.   Tantus Techs., Inc. , \nB-411608, B -411608.3, Sept. 14, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 299 at 6.   \n Contrary to the protester\u2019s contention, the record does not support Mobomo\u2019s assertion regarding the unfair weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 in the agency\u2019s evaluation under the technical approach factor.  First, the technical evaluation demonstrates the agency considered the positive and negative aspects of both vendors\u2019 quotations across all the PWS task areas.  See, e.g.,  AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 3 -4, 9-10.  Second, the \nrecord evidences that the source selection authority did highlight Mobomo\u2019s deficiencies, as compared to ResolveSoft, specifically with regard to elements of PWS \ntasks 3 and 5.  See e.g.,  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 13 (noting that Mobomo\u2019s \u201c technical \napproach lacked clarity and details in several key aspects of the PWS, specifically in [tasks 3 and 5].\u201d).   \n However, the same paragraph cited by the protester as confirmation of impermissible weighting of PWS tasks 3 and 5 also highlights Mobomo\u2019s shortcomings in another PWS area, task 1 (project management).  Id . (identifying Mobomo\u2019s quotation as lacking \ndetail in how it would handle defect recurrence).  Thus, the record does not support a contention that NOAA was exclusively concerned with PWS tasks 3 and 5.  Third, and most relevant to our analysis, the mere f act that a source selection authority finds \ndiscri minators in some, but not all, of the evaluated tasks does not equate to the \nagency\u2019s consideration of those specific tasks above all others.  Indeed, in a best -value \nprocurement, particularly where technical factors are more important than price, an agenc y may focus on a particular discriminator, and merely highlighting a specific \naspect of a quotation in the selection decision does not, by itself, render the evaluation unreasonable.  See, e.g.,  SGT, Inc., B -405736,  B-405736.2 Dec. 27, 2011, 2012 CPD \n\u00b6 149 at 10; Teledyne Brown Eng\u2019 g, B-258078; B -258078.2, Dec. 6, 1994, 94- 2 CPD \n\u00b6 223 at 12- 13.  \n Next, turning to the agency\u2019s evaluation under the staffing and management approach\/key personnel factor, Mobomo challenges NOAA\u2019s evaluation of its key personnel, arguing the agency unreasonably found that the resumes for all three of the firm\u2019s key perso ns failed to demonstrate experience in several key PWS areas.  Protest \nat 39-48; Comments and Supp. Protest at 26- 32; Supp. Comments at 17- 18; 2nd Supp. \nComments at 34- 59.  Again, based upon our review of the record, we find nothing \nunreasonable with the agency\u2019s evaluation.  We address one representative example, below.  \n Vendors were required to submit resumes for three identified key persons:  (1) a w eb \nproject manager\/ scrum master ; (2) l ead developer\/ technical architect ; and (3) digital \nproduct analyst\/UX researcher .  RFQ at 13, 59- 60.  NOAA would evaluate, among other \nthings, \u201c the strength of  the proposed key personnel including education and  Page 12 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  professional certifications\/credentials \u201d as well as \u201c the currency, quality and depth of \nexperience of the proposed key personnel  working on similar projects. \u201d  RFQ at 65.  For \neach identified key personnel position, the PWS provided a bullet point list of primary \nresponsibilities.  See e.g., PWS at  14 (identifying 13 core areas the web project \nmanager\/scrum master would perform).   \n The agency\u2019s evaluation found several aspects of Mobomo\u2019s proposed web project manager\/scrum master that increase NOAA\u2019s confidence in successful performance of the contract.  See AR, Tab 23, Evaluation Report at 4 (identifying several positive \naspects of the web project manager\u2019s resume and experience relevant to the subject PWS).  However, the evaluators also found that the web project manager\u2019s resume did not demonstrate \u201c experience in three responsibilities of the role that are important to the \nsuccess of project requirements and goals [.]\u201d  Id. at 5.  Specifically, the TET explained \nthat the project manager\/scrum master did not demonstrate experience to:  (1) m onitor \nand manage project risks throughout the development process , which \u201c directly relates to \nrisk management requirements \u201d; (2) o versee quality control and quality assurance \nprocesses , which was identified as \u201cc ritical to the successful execution of the approach \nMobomo presents []\u201d; and (3) o versee documentation of the website\u2019s architecture and \nconfigurations as well as project processes , a requirement for PWS tasks 1 and 3.  Id.; \nsee also PWS at  14. \n Mobomo contends these findings are in error.  Indeed, the protester argues while its proposed w eb project manager\/ scrum master \u2019s \u201cresume does not use the exact words \ncalled out in the Re- Evaluation  Summary, a complete review of his resume \ndemonstrates [he] has experience with each  of these three responsibilities .\u201d  Protest \nat 40.  In this regard, Mobomo argues the key person\u2019s experience managing a Drupal \nupgrade, oversight of daily scrums, experience using a process implementation indicator description (PI ID) to monitor project health, and maintenance of CMMI -\ncompliant documentation satisfy the PWS requirements.  2nd Supp. Comments at 34-41.   \n Our Office has consistently stated that it is a vendor\u2019s responsibility  to submit a well -\nwritten quotation, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements .  Yukon Fire Prot. Servs. Inc. , supra  at 5.  \nA vendor  risks having its quotation evaluated unfavorably where it fails to submit an \nadequately written quotation.   Id.   \n On this record, we find no evidence to suggest the agency\u2019s evaluation conclusions were unreasonable.  For example, concerning the web project manager\u2019s leading a Drupal upgrade, as explained by the TET chair in his declaration, \u201c software upgrade  \nrisk management and continuous risk management are related but different in scope and application.\u201d  TET Chair Dec. at 6.  Thus, \u201c[m] anaging a Drupal upgrade can \ndemonstrate some aspects  of risk management experience, but that experience alone \ndoes not fully  demonstrate risk management \u201d because \u201c[r]isk  management is an \nongoing, structured process. \u201d  Id.  Similarly, while Mobomo argues the key person\u2019s \nexperience overseeing daily scrum meetings demonstrates oversight of quality  Page 13 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  control\/assurance processes, the TET disagreed.  The TET chair explains scrum \nmeetings \u201ccan help surface quality -related issues and improve communication between \ndevelopers and testers,  [but] they do not constitute [quality control\/assurance] \noversight. \u201d  Id.  We find reasonable the agency\u2019s evaluation conclusions; Mobomo\u2019s \ndisagreement, without more, provides no basis to sustain the protest.  DEI Consulting, supra at 2. \n Exchanges  \n Following its initial evaluation of quotations, NOAA, having determined that ResolveSoft was the apparent successful vendor, entered into exchanges with the firm.  See  RFQ \nat 64 (\u201cOnce the Government determines the contractor that is the best -suited ( i.e., the \napparent  successful contractor), the Government reserves the right to communicate \nwith only that contractor to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a \ntask order with that contractor. \u201d).  The agency sought clarification concerning w here \ncertain subscription and hosting platform costs were included in ResolveSoft\u2019s price quotation.  Supp. COS at 10- 11.  ResolveSoft submitted a revised pricing quotation in \nresponse, resulting in an increase in price of approximately $[DELETED].  AR, Tab 24, ADD at 10.  Following Mobomo\u2019s initial protest, NOAA, as part of its corrective action, conducted a reevaluation of quotations, but did not engage in any additional exchanges with either the protester or ResolveSoft.  Id.   \n The protester challenges the agency\u2019s failure to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as part of its corrective action.  Mobomo agrees that NOAA was, consistent with the solicitation, permitted to conduct exchanges with ResolveSoft following the best suited \ndetermination made as part the initial evaluation of quotations.  However, the protester contends that once the agency agreed to undertake a new evaluation of quotations, \u201cResolveSoft was no longer the apparent awardee\u201d and \u201c[a]t that stage, the Agency was \nrequired to conduct leveling discussions with Mobomo to allow quotes to be evaluated \non an equal basis .\u201d  Comments and Supp. Protest at 4.  In this regard, Mobomo argues \nNOAA\u2019s exchanges with ResolveSoft constituted discussions, and such \u201c one-sided \ndiscussions tainted the reevaluation\u201d because \u201c NOAA permitted  ResolveSoft to address \nweaknesses identified by the Agency and submit a revised quote without  affording \nMobomo the opportunity to do the same.\u201d  Id. at 6.  See also Supp. Comments at 5- 9.  \nIn response, the agency contends its decision to engage in exchanges with ResolveSoft was reasonable, or, in the alternative, Mobomo suffered no competitive prejudice as a result of NOAA\u2019s failure to enter into exchanges with the protester.  Supp. Memorandum of Law (MO L) at 2- 5. \n Where an agency chooses to conduct exchanges with vendors in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, the exchanges, like all other aspects of such a procurement, must be fair and equitable; our Office has looked to the standards in FAR part 15 for guidance in makin g this determination.  Aurotech, Inc. , B-413861.4, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 205 \nat 10.  In this regard, FAR part 15 defines clarifications as \u201climited exchanges\u201d that agencies may use to allow offerors to clarify certain aspects of their proposals (or in this \ncase, quotations), or to resolve minor clerical mistakes.  See FAR 15.306(a)(1),(2); Sky  Page 14 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  Solutions, LLC , B-421139.2, B -421139.3, June 30, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 184 at 6.  In \ncontrast, under FAR part 15, discussions occur when an agency communicates with an \nofferor for the purpose of obtaining information essential to determining the acceptability of a proposal or quotation or provides the offeror with an opportunity to revise or modify its proposal or quotation.  Innovative Mgmt. & Tech. Approaches, Inc. , B-418823.3, \nB-418823.4, Jan.  8, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 18 at 8.  \n We have previously resolved protests involving similarly worded solicitation provisions that allowed an agency to address any issues, including technical or price, only with the best-suited contractor, including in FAR subpart 8.4 procurements.  See, e.g., A Square \nGrp., LLC , B-421792.5, Apr. 11, 2025, 2025 CPD \u00b6  95 at 7 (denying protest ground \nalleging that the agency conducted unequal discussions pursuant to a similar solicitation provision in a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement); Sky Solutions, LLC , supra at 6-7 (same); \nsee also VariQ -CV JV, LLC, B -418551, B -418551.3, June 15, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  196 \nat 18-20 (denying a similar challenge in a FAR subpart 16.5 procurement).  In those \ndecisions, which were protests challenging an agency\u2019s conduct of exchanges, we denied protest grounds alleging the agency conducted unequal discussions primarily on \nthe basis that the agency\u2019s actions in holding exchanges were consistent with the terms of the solicitation, while also noting that the procurements at issue were conducted under FAR procedures other than those found at FA R part 15.  See Sky Solutions , LLC, \nsupra at 7; VariQ -CV JV, LLC, supra at 20.   \n Mobomo\u2019s protest presents a novel factual scenario.   That is, rather than a challenge to \nthe propriety of exchanges with ResolveSoft following the agency\u2019s initial evaluation, the protester contends the agency was required to enter into exchanges with Mobomo as \npart of its corrective action, so to place the two firms on an equal competitive footing for the reevaluation.   Here, on this record, we conclude that Mobomo cannot demonstrate it \nwas competitively prejudiced by the agency\u2019s conduct.   See, e.g., Interfor US, Inc., \nB-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD \u00b6 19 at 7 (\u201cCompetitive prejudice is an essential \nelement of every viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evident, we will not sustain a protest, even where a protester may have shown that an agency\u2019s actions arguably were improper.\u201d).  \n Several facts in the record lead us to this conclusion.   First, we note that the parties are \nseemingly in agreement that the solicitation permitted the exchanges NOAA engaged in with ResolveSoft, as the apparent awardee, following the agency\u2019s initial eval uation.   \nSee Supp. MOL at 2- 4; Supp. Comments at 6- 7.  Second,  the record demonstrates that \nResolveSoft, as a result of those exchanges, made changes to its pricing volume, but did not make changes to its technical quotation.  See  AR, Tab  24, ADD at 10.  I ndeed, \nthe agency\u2019s technical reevaluation was unaffected as a result of those pricing changes.  Third, the record demonstrates that both after the agency\u2019s initial evaluation of \nquotations, and after its reevaluation following its decision to take corrective action in response to Mobomo\u2019s initial protest, ResolveSoft was determined to be the best -suited \nvendor .  Id.  That is, the status quo ante prior to the agency\u2019s undertaking corrective \naction remained in effect; ResolveSoft endured as the best -suited v endor  even at a \nhigher price.   Finally, and as discussed more fully above, we find no basis to object to  Page 15 B-423027.2; B -423027.3  the agency\u2019s reevaluation conclusions, to include NOAA\u2019s evaluation of vendors\u2019 \ntechnical quotations, or  that ResolveSoft\u2019s quotation was technically superior to \nMobomo\u2019s quotation.  \n Under these unique facts, Mobomo cannot reasonably demonstrate it was prejudiced by \nthe agency\u2019s conduct .  Mobomo was not the best -suited vendor  following the initial \nevaluation, nor was it the best -suited vendor  following the agency\u2019s reevaluation.  Id.  \nThus, under the established terms of the solicitation, Mobomo was not eligible for exchanges with NOAA.   See Sky Solutions , supra at 7 (denying protest on basis that \nagency, having determined the awardee was the best -suited vendor, reasonably \nentered into exchanges with the firm).  Moreover, as the protester acknowledges, our \nOffice\u2019s decisions explain an agency may conduct exchanges solely with the best -suited \nvendor  so long as the agency \u201creasonably and fairly\u201d evaluates vendors\u2019 quotations.  \nComments at 6 (citing S2 Analytical Sols., LLC, B -422281.3, Dec. 20, 2024, 2024 CPD \n\u00b6 312 at 3).    \n Again, as developed more fully, above, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s underlying \nevaluation of quotations.   And finally, ResolveSoft, through exchanges, made no \nalterations to its technical quotation, and the firm\u2019s pricing changes had no impact on the underlying merits of the agency\u2019s reevaluation or tradeoff decision.  AR, Tab 24, \nADD at 10.  In sum:  Resolv eSoft\u2019s initial quotation was evaluated as technically \nsuperior; the exchanges had no bearing on ResolveSoft\u2019s technical quotation and were limited t o a single issue, resulting in a net increase to the awardee\u2019s proposed price; \nand ResolveSoft\u2019s unchanged, initial non- price quotation was confirmed as technically \nsuperior following the agency\u2019s reevaluation.  On this specific record, we find no basis to \nsustain the protest allegation.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

Id. at 13; AR, Tab 7 , Business Clearance Memorandum \n(BCM)  at 4; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 2 . \n \nAward was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis considering three factors:  \norganizational experience, key personnel,  and cost.2  TORFP at 68.   The organizational \nexperience  factor  was of equal importance to the key personnel evaluation factor.   Id. \nThe non- cost evaluation factors , when combined, were significantly more important than \ncost.  Id.  \n Under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate each offeror\u2019s \nexperience related to five key areas:  key area 1 (hiring and r etaining engineering \nprofessionals ), key  area 2 (enterprise server ), key area 3  (enterprise system \nmanagement ), key area 4  (virtual desktop infrastructure ); and key area 5 (consolidated \ninfrastructure administration) .  Id. at 62.   To demonstrate its experience, each offeror \nwas to provide up to three references.   Id.  Under the key personnel factor, the agency \nwas to evaluate the extent to which the offeror\u2019s proposed key personnel met and exceeded desired qualifications  set forth in the TORFP.  Id. at 70.   \n The Navy  received timely submitted proposals from f ive offerors, including OSC and \nSRC.  AR, Tab 7 , BCM  at 8; COS\/MOL at 4.

Id.  \n On December 23, 2024, the agency notified OSC that its proposal had not been \nselected for award.  AR, Tab 1, Notice of Award.  After requesting and receiving a \ndebriefing that concluded on January 13, 2025, OSC filed this protest with our Office.\n4 \n DISCUSSION  The protester raises numerous arguments challenging the agency \u2019s evaluation of the \nofferors \u2019 proposals under the organizational experience and key personnel  factors .  For \nexample, the protester challenges a weakness assessed to its proposal under the organizational experience factor.  The protester also contends that the Navy unreasonably failed to assign a significant strength to its proposal under the key \npersonnel factor.  With regard to the awardee, the protester asserts that the agency \nimproperly allow ed SRC to provide more than the three references allowed by the \nsolicitation in support of its organizational experience.  Finally, the protester maintains \nthat the best -value tradeoff was unreasonable.   For the reasons discussed below, we \nfind no basis to sustain the protest.\n5 \n The evaluation of an offeror\u2019s proposal is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion. \nNational Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. , B-401063.2 et al. , Jan. 30, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 59 at 5.  In \nreviewing protests challenging an agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not \nreevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency, but rather examines the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s judgment was reasonable and \nin accord with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

Cubic Applications, Inc. , \nB-411305, B -411305.2, July 9, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6  218 at 7.  A protester\u2019s disagreement \nwith the agency\u2019s judgment in evaluating proposals or in its determination of the relative merit of competing proposals, without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Veterans Evaluation Servs., Inc. et al. , B-412940 et al. , July 13, 2016, \n2016 CPD \u00b6 185 at 8- 9. \n \n4 The value of the task order is $44 million and is therefore within our jurisdiction to \nreview protests related to the issuance of orders exceeding $3 5 million under multiple-\naward IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n5 Although we do not address all of the protester \u2019s arguments in this decision, we have \nconsidered all of them and any not directly addressed in this decision are without merit.   Page 4    B-423287; B -423287.2    \nOrganizational Experience  OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assessed its proposal with a significant weakness under key area 1 of the organizational experience factor --hiring and r etaining \nengineering professionals --for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain \ncybersecurity and infrastructure engineering professionals .  Specifically, OSC argues \nthe agency ignored language in its proposal.  Protest at 11.  The protester also asserts \nthat the agency improperly  determined that one of OSC\u2019s  contract references was not \nrelevant  to key area 1.   The protester further asserts that in conducting its evaluation, \nthe agency improperly applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Id. at 13.  As discussed \nbelow, we find none of the protester\u2019s arguments provides a basis to sustain the protest.  \n As noted above, under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate \neach offeror\u2019s experience related to five key areas .  Of relevance here, key area 1 was \nexperience \u201cin hiring and r etaining engineering professionals , specifically Information \nSystems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineer ing, in the Colorado \nSprings, CO area.\u201d\n6  TORFP at 62.   The TORFP specified that offerors must cite at \nleast one reference for work performed by the prime offeror, no more than one reference per subcontractor, and no more than three references total.  Id.   For each \ncited reference, the s olicitation required offerors to submit a r eference information sheet \nin which the offeror would provide a summary description of the contract work, including an explanation of the relevance of each cited reference with respect to one or more of the key areas.  Id.  The agency was to evaluate the breadth, depth and relevance of an \nofferor\u2019s cited organizational experience in the key areas since July 1, 2019.  Id. at 69 . \nThe solicitation made clear that the a gency was \u201cnot bound by an offeror\u2019s opinion of \nthe relevance of its organizational experience.\u201d  Id. at 62. \n In evaluating OSC\u2019s proposal under the organizational experience factor, the agency assessed a significant strength for the enterprise server key area, a significant strength \nfor the enterprise system management key area, a significant strength for the virtual desktop infrastructure key area, a  strength for the consolidated infrastructure \nadministration key area, and a  significant weakness for  the hiring and retaining \nengineering professionals key area, resulting in an overall rating of good for the organiz ational experience factor.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41; AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report \nat 13. \n The agency determined that OSC\u2019s proposal provided one reference relevant to key \narea 1; the reference was for North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD)\/United \nStates Northern Command (NORTHCOM) information technology ( IT) Network \nOperations and Maintenance Support (N2NOMS) --a contract performed by  [DELETED] , \na proposed subcontractor.  AR , Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  This relevant reference \n \n6 The other key areas of experience related to enterprise server support, enterprise \nsystem management support, virtual desktop infrastructure, and consolidated infrastructure administration.  TORFP at 62 .  Page 5    B-423287; B -423287.2   stated that in \u201csupport of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT \nprofessionals including systems engineers, systems administrators, network engineers, \nnetwork administrators, systems architects, database administrators, data center technicians, change managers, and service desk managers. \u201d  Id. (citing AR, Tab 9 , \nOSC Proposal at  13-14).  The reference further stated that, \u201c[i]n support of the long- term \ntask and the project based additional work, [DELETED]  has averaged an 18- month \ntenure on all progr am hires, and our long- term hires have been in place for over three \nyears. \u201d  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  14; Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  \n In evaluating OSC\u2019s proposal, the agency assessed a significant weakness based on two identified flaws.  First, the agency found that although i nformation systems and \nnetwork engineers we re explicitly identified in the  N2NOMS contract, infrastructure or \ncybersecurity engineers we re not , meaning that  OSC had only  partially show n \nexperience hiring engineering professionals in Colorado Springs, C olorado, under the \nN2NOMS contract.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41.  Second, the agency found that \u201c[i]n \naddition, [DELETED]  hired 32 contractors throughout this contract (11\/26\/2019 -\n11\/25\/2024) in Colorado Springs but maintains an average of only 13- 15 full -time \nequivalents (p. 13) over the contract\u2019s lifespan. \u201d  Id.  The agency concluded that \u201c[t] his \ndoes not adequately demonstrate [ OSC\u2019s ] ability to retain the needed engineering \ntalent. \u201d  Id.  In making this determination, the agency noted that \u201c[t] he ability to hire AND \nretain technical engineering talent in the Colorado Springs area is crucial for the successful performance of this [U.S. Space Command]  requirement. \u201d  Id. \n The protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s evaluation, arguing that the agency \ndisregarded or misconstrued the proposal \u2019s description of [DELETED] \u2019s experience \nretaining professionals under the N2NOMS contract  when assigning the significant \nweakness .  Protest at 11 -13.  OSC maintains that because its proposal indicated the \nhiring of 32 IT professionals , but an average of only 13- 15 full time equivalents ( FTEs ) \nover the period of performance, the agency  incorrectly  assumed that a large number of \nthe hires were not being retained.  Rather, per the protester, the clear language of \nOSC\u2019s  proposal should have led the agency to determine that the disparity between the \ntwo numbers is attributable to the fact that a number of the 32 hires were short term employees hired to meet surge requirements.  \n In support of its argument, OSC points to the following description in its proposal of its \nsubcontractor \u2019s recruitment and retention experience under the N2NOMS contract : \n \n[DELETED]  averages 13- 15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the life of the \ncontract and has also provided additional head count and support for project -based surge and specialized resources for implementations and \ntesting of new systems or technologies.  Over the life of the contract, we \nhave hired 32 contractors to support this effort.  \nProtest at 11 (citing AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 13 ). \n \nOSC asserts that this language in its proposal meant that \u201c the contract requires \n[DELETED]  to hire and retain a permanent staff the size of 13- 15 FTEs, which the  Page 6    B-423287; B -423287.2   subcontractor fulfilled.\u201d  Protest at 11 -12.  The protester further asserts that \u201c[i]n addition \nto this regular workforce, to support \u2018project -based surge and specialized resources for \nimplementation and testing of new systems or technologies, \u2019\u201d its proposal explained that \n\u201c[DELETED]  \u2018also provided additional head count.\u2019\u201d  Protest at 12 (citing AR, Tab 9, \nOSC Proposal at 11).  From this, OSC argues that its proposal clearly demonstrated \nthat [DELETED]  hired a total of 32 IT professionals that were a mix of  long- term and \nsurge employees.  Id. at 12.  The agency responds that OSC\u2019s proposal lacked clear \nand definitive retention information necessary to adequately demonstrate their ability to \nretain the needed engineering talent.  COS\/MOL at 7.  \n Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  The record shows that OSC\u2019s proposal stated that \u201cin support of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT professionals[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  13.  It also \nstated that [DELETED]  maintains on average \u201c 13-15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the \nlife of the contract .\u201d  Id.  Contrary to OSC\u2019s argument, the proposal does not provide a \n\u201cclear representation about [DELETED] \u2019 staff retention experience under the N2NOMS \ncontract.\u201d  Protest at  11.  As the agency explains in response to the protest , OSC\u2019s \nproposal did not connect the delta between overall number of staff hired for the contract and the average \u201congoing\u201d FTEs to surge requirements, as OSC argues in the protest.  Protest at 11; COS\/ MOL at 6.  Specifically, although OSC\u2019s proposal  also states that \n[DELETED]  \u201cprovided additional head count and support for project -based surge,\u201d the \nproposal never states that any of the \u201chired 32 IT professionals,\u201d of which [DELETED]  \nretained only \u201c13- 15 FTES on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract,\u201d were surge \nemployees.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Pro posal  at 13.  It is an offeror \u2019s responsibility to submit a \nwell-written proposal, with adequately detailed information, which clearly demonstrates \ncompliance with the solicitation requirements and allows for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Tribalco, LLC , B-421837.3, Feb. 5, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 49 at 6.  Here, \nto the extent OSC wanted the agency to know that the difference between the 32 hired \nemployees and the 13-15 average FTEs  is due to roughly 17 of the hired employees \nbeing surge support , then it was incumbent upon OSC to adequately explain this in its \nproposal.  OSC\u2019s proposal failed to do so.  As such, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.\n7  The protest ground is denied.  \n \n7 In a supplemental protest, OSC also claims the agency disparately evaluated the \nofferors\u2019 stated retention rates.  Comments  & Supp. Protest  at 16- 19.  According to \nOSC, the agency\u2019s comparison of OSC\u2019s and SRC\u2019s retention rates \u201ccannot be fair\u201d because the agency accepted SRC\u2019s stated 82.1 percent  retention rate without \nquestioning how it was calculated,  but arbitrarily calculated OSC\u2019s retention rate based \non the assumption that [DELETED]  hired 32 IT professional s but only retained 13- 15 of \nthem on the N2NOMS contract.  Id. at 17.  While OSC contends that t his argument is \nbased on the agency\u2019s comparison of retention rates in the Business Clearance Memorandum, see id., the agency provided OSC with the exact same information in the \ndebriefing.  Compare AR, Tab 7, BCM at 40- 42, with AR, Tab 3, OSC Debrief  at 49.  As \nsuch, OSC was required to raise this argument within ten days of the debriefing.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a); Supp. COS\/ MOL  at 4-5.  Because OSC first presented this \n(continued...)   Page 7    B-423287; B -423287.2    Unstated Evaluation Criterion \n \nOSC also asserts  that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion under \norganizational experience key area 1 when highlighting that its proposal\u2019s description of \nthe N2NOMS contract does not reflect experience hiring infrastructure or cybersecurity engineers.  Protest at 13-16.  This argument stems from the agency\u2019s answer to one of \nOSC\u2019s debriefing questions regarding the key area 1 evaluation wherein the agency stated that there was insufficient detail in OSC\u2019s proposal regarding the program hires or long- term hires, for example, identification of the \u201clabor categories for these \u2018hires.\u2019\u201d  \nAR, Tab 4, Debriefing Answers  at 3.  OSC asserts there was no evaluation criteri on for \nthis key area that required identification of labor categories with respect to hiring and retention, and therefore, to the extent that  OSC\u2019s evaluation was based on the failure of \nOSC\u2019s proposal to provide \u201clabor categories\u201d for the 32 hires , it reflects an unstated \nevaluation criteri on.  Protest at  13.   \n The agency responds that, in its answer to the debriefing question, the agency was \u201cmerely trying to explain to OSC what type of information may have assisted in making the information it did provide more meaningful for evaluation.\u201d   COS\/MOL at 7 -8.  In this \nregard, the agency explains that it did not assess the weakness based on the failure of \nOSC\u2019s proposal  to include labor categories, but rather, that the identified flaw was \nbased on the failure of OSC\u2019s proposal to provide any information regarding the retention of infrastructure or cybersecurity engineering talent as required by the solicitation.  Id.  at 7. \n Based on our review, we find that the agency\u2019s evaluation was not based on an \nunstated evaluation criterion.  T he TORFP  expressly required offerors to demonstrate \nexperience hiring and retaining specific engineering positions relevant to the work to be performed in the Colorado Springs area, specifically including infrastructure and \ncybersecurity engineering positions .  TORFP at 6 2.  As noted above, the agency \nidentified a flaw because OSC\u2019s proposal failed to demonstrate that [DELETED]  had \nexperience hiring and retaining infrastructure engineers and cybersecurity engineers  \nunder the N2NOMS contract .  While the protester alleges that the agency improperly \nassessed a flaw to it s proposal for failing to identify labor categories for the 32 hires, the \nprotester has failed to demonstrate, and there is no indication in the evaluation record,  \nthat the agency evaluated or expected offerors to provide information regarding labor categories.  The agency\u2019s evaluation was consistent with the solicitation and reasonable.  Accordingly, t his protest ground is denied.  \n \n \nargument as a supplemental protest on March 3, 2025, nearly two months after the debriefing, the argument is dismissed as untimely.    Page 8    B-423287; B -423287.2    Relevance of Reference \n \nAs noted above, relevant to the hiring and r etaining engineering professionals  key area, \nthe agency determined that OSC\u2019s proposal provided one relevant reference for its \nsubcontractor,  [DELETED] .  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  OSC argues the agency \nunreasonably found not relevant its second reference,  which was for Information \nTechnology Infrastructure Support 3 (ITIS3) for the U.S. Army, Human Resources Command (HRC) at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Indianapolis, Indiana.  Protest at 16- 17. \n The solicitation provided clear requirements regarding what experience the agency was \nto evaluate under the organizational experience factor in each key area and the relevant timeframe for such experience.  TORFP at 62 .  The solicitation required offerors to \n\u201cindicate the breadth, depth and relevance of your organizational experience since 01 July 2019\u201d and,  for key area 1,  to demonstrate \u201c[e]xperience in hiring and retaining \nengineering professionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.\u201d  Id.   Accordingly, the \nsolicitation expressly identified the type of engineering positions and performance location that would be considered relevant to key area 1.  \n When evaluating OSC\u2019s proposal against these criteria, the agency determined that OSC\u2019s HRC contract was not relevant to key area 1 because the place of performance \nwas Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Indianapolis, Indiana, whereas the contract awarded under the solicitation here will be performed in the Colorado Springs area.  AR, Tab 8, \nSSEB Report at 11.  \n \nOSC argues that this finding reflects an unstated evaluation criterion because \u201c[t]here is no mention in the [ s]olicitation that the recruitment and retention experience has to be \nexplicitly for in -person staff in the Colorado Springs area.\u201d\n8  Protest at 18.  OSC further \nmaintains that the HRC contract was relevant because even though the contract was not performed in Colorado Springs, \u201csome\u201d staff for unidentified positions were recruited \n \n8 In its supplemental protest, OSC also contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation \u201cgives \nrise to a latent ambiguity\u201d because the solicitation did not specifically require experience hiring in -person IT professionals, and it was reasonable for OSC to believe hiring \nremote workers would be relevant.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 16.  In response, the \nagency argues that OSC\u2019s latent ambiguity argument relies \u201con the same facts that OSC was aware of when it made its initial unstated evaluation criteria argument in its protest.\u201d  Supp. COS\/MOL  at 2-3.  That is, both OSC\u2019s unstated evaluation criteria \nargument and its latent ambiguity argument are based on the a gency finding the HRC \ncontract not relevant because its place of performance was not the Colorado Springs area--a finding of which OSC was made aware in its debriefing.  AR, Tab 3, OSC \nDebrief at 3.  Accordingly, to be timely, OSC would have needed to raise its latent \nambiguity argument in its initial protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  Because OSC did not \nmake this argument until it submitted its comments 49 days after the a gency responded \nto OSC\u2019s debriefing questions, this argument is dismissed as untimely .  Page 9    B-423287; B -423287.2   from the area and work ed remotely from Colorado Springs .  See id.  at 17.   In support of \nits position, OSC quotes two lines from its proposal:  \n \nOSC Edge staffs the HRC ITIS3 contract with engineering professionals.  \nOur staff is a combination of onsite and remote and we do have staff in the Colorado Springs area to include key personnel.  \nId. (quoting AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal  at 7).  \n \nThe agency  maintains that \u201chiring and retention in Colorado Springs for a contract with a \nplace of performance on- site logically encompasses looking at an offeror\u2019s ability to hire \nand retain in that capacity.\u201d  COS\/ MOL at 9.  In this regard, the agency further explains \nin response to the protest that \u201c[t]he capacity to hire and retain engineering \nprofessionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO  area for an onsite requirement \nis not an equivalent to the capacity to hire and retain for telework in Colorado Springs.\u201d  Id.   \n Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  While the protester contends that the solicitation evaluation criteria for hiring and retaining engineering professionals did not require demonstration of recruitment and retention experience explicitly for in- person staff in the Colorado Springs area, we do \nnot find that the agency\u2019s determination that the HRC contract was not relevant on this basis was improper.  In evaluating a proposal, an agency properly may take into \naccount specific, albeit not expressly identified, matters that are logically encompassed \nby or related to the stated evaluation criteria.  Preferred Sys. Sols. , B-291750, Feb. 24, \n2003, 2003 CPD \u00b6 56 at 2.   \n The record shows that while OSC\u2019s reference demonstrated the capacity to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs who were willing to telework, it failed to demonstrate the \nability to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs for an onsite assignment.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 7.  Because an offeror\u2019s ability to hire and retain staff to work on- site in \nColorado Springs is logically encompassed within the evaluation criteria, which expressly identify the performance location that would be considered relev ant to key \narea 1, it was reasonable for the agency to find that OSC\u2019s HRC reference was not relevant for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain staff on- site in Colorado \nSprings.   TORFP at 62.   As such, we find that the agency\u2019s evaluation--including \nconsideration of an offeror\u2019s ability to demonstrate hiring and retention for on- site work \nin the Colorado Springs area in assessing relevance--is not based on an unstated \nevaluation criterion.  While the protester may disagree with  the agency\u2019s  assessment of \nrelevance for its HRC reference, such disagreement, without more, is insufficient to establish that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.

As such, t his protest ground is denied.  \n  Page 10    B-423287; B -423287.2    Awardee\u2019s Organizational Experience References  \n \nThe solicitation specified that offerors could provide \u201cno more than three references \ntotal\u201d in support of their organizational experience.  TORFP at 6 2.  One of the awardee\u2019s \nreferences was for  its C2 Mission Services (C2 Cyber) t ask order No. N6600123F0062 \nunder SRC \u2019s Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific  IDIQ contract.  AR, Tab  11, SRC \nProposal at 3.  OSC argues that the agency\u2019s evaluation of SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber  reference \nwas unreasonable because the evaluation noted that SRC started hiring IT professionals for the task order  two years before the task order began in November \n2022.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 33.  OSC claims that the agency improperly \ncredited SRC for hiring and retention experience that took place before the C2 Cyber  \ntask order began--essentially asserting that SRC attempted to bootstrap other efforts external to the C2 Cyber  task order to its C2 Cyber  reference, thereby allowing SRC to \nprovide more than the three references allowed by the solicitation.  Id.  at 33- 36.   \n As noted previously, the TORFP defined  the hiring and r etaining engineering \nprofessionals  key area as recent (since July  1, 2019) \u201c[e]xperience in hiring and \nretaining engineering professionals, specifically I nformation Systems, Network, \nInfrastructure, and C ybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.\u201d  \nTORFP at 62 .  In SRC\u2019s reference for the C2 Cyber  task order, SRC cites its \u201csupport [ ] \n[for] the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNO RTHCOM) (N- NC) Cyberspace Operations \nDirectorate (J6) Mission Systems Support Team since November 2020. \u201d  AR, Tab 11, \nSRC Proposal at 4.   \n \nIn addition, SRC\u2019s proposal states that it has also \u201csupported the United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) J6 Directorate\u2019s Consolidated Space Operations Facility Team (J6X) and J6 Cyber (J6C) since February 2021, on [C2 Cyber] [t]ask [o]rder (TO) N6600123F0062.\u201d  Id.   In this regard, SRC notes that \u201cSRC has teamed with \n[DELETED]  and [DELETED]  to provide the Government with the ultimate combination of \nflexibility, technical expertise, and tailored staffing in Colorado Springs.\u201d   Id.  \nSpecifically, SRC\u2019s pr oposal states that, in order to \u201covercome the challenges of staffing \nin the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the Department of Defense [(DOD)],\u201d it has, \u201c[s]ince November 2020, [ ] hired 35 IT professionals in the \nColorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering.\u201d  Id.  SRC also states that, for \nthis task order, it \u201csuccessfully staffed six uniquely qualified Full -Time Equivalent (FTE) \nIS and Cybersecurity engineering positions --each with Top Secret (TS) security \nclearances and eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) read- in.\u201d  Id.   \n In evaluating SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber  reference, the agency found that \u201c SRC has demonstrated \nsuccessful staffing and retention in the Colorado Springs area for the Department of Defense\u201d, noting that \u201c[s]ince November 2020, SRC has hired 35 IT professionals in the Colorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering. \u201d  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 7.  \n  Page 11    B-423287; B -423287.2   OSC disagrees with the agency\u2019s evaluation and asserts that SRC\u2019s proposal included \n\u201can indeterminate number of experience references,\u201d and that the agency unreasonably credited SRC for three years of performance by itself and other companies prior to the beginning of the C2 Cyber  task order.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35.   In response, \nthe agency explains that SRC\u2019s proposal simply demonstrated how SRC hired and retained personnel for the C2 Cyber  task order.  Supp. COS\/ MOL at 7.  The agency \nmaintains that \u201c [w]hether SRC hired these employees before or during the task order is \nimmaterial\u201d because \u201cthe fact [is] that [SRC was ] able to hire and retain for performance \nunder\u201d the C2 Cyber  task order.  Id.    \n Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  The record reflects  that SRC\u2019s partnerships with the two [DELETED]  companies and the \nhiring discussed in SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber reference was in support of the C2 Cyber  task \norder.  While OSC is correct that the task order in SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber  reference did not \nbegin until November 2022, this does not mean that hiring was not conducted in anticipation of the task order.  Although the relevant task order did not begin until \nNovember 2022, SRC \u2019s proposal explains that it  started recruiting in November 2020 in \nanticipation of the task order to \u201covercome the challenges of staffing in the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the [DOD].\u201d  AR, Tab 11, SRC \nProposal  at 4.  While OSC asserts that SRC should not have received credit for the \nhiring that occurred prior to the start of the task order because the hiring was not done under the task order, as previously noted, the solicitation required offerors to provide \u201corganiz ational experience since 01 July 201 9,\u201d and key area 1 required experience \nhiring and retaining certain engineering professional in the Colorado Springs area.  TORFP at 62 .  The protester neither asserts nor cites to any requirement in the \nsolicitation that specified that this hiring and retaining experience had to be obtained \nexclusively during a reference\u2019s period of performance to be relevant or a prohibition on hiring and retaining experience in anticipation of performing a reference contract.  Supp. Comments at 5-12; TORFP at 6 2.  To the extent OSC asserts that it was improper for \nthe agency to have considered SRC\u2019s experience in this regard as relevant to SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber task order, the protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation, without \nmore, is insufficient to render the agency\u2019s evaluation unreasonable.  This protest ground is denied.   Key Personnel  \n OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposal under the key personnel factor for its proposed senior systems engineer.  OSC also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the qualifications of  its proposed program \nmanager , asserting that  OSC\u2019s proposal merited a significant strength, rather than just a \nstrength.     Senior Systems Engineer  \n OSC argues that the a gency\u2019s evaluation under the key personnel factor  was \nunreasonable based on the assignment of a weakness for OSC\u2019s proposed senior  Page 12    B-423287; B -423287.2   systems engineer.  OSC alleges that the a gency unreasonably assigned it s proposal  a \nweakness because it concluded that its proposed senior systems engineer  did not meet \ntwo of the solicitation\u2019s seven desired experience areas  for the position.  Protest \nat 18-26.  OSC contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation was improper because, in its \nview, the resume of its proposed senior systems engineer  \u201creadily meets or exceeds the \n[a]gency\u2019s evaluation criteria\u201d and the a gency either misread or rigidly read OSC\u2019s \npropos al.  Id. at 18. \n \nUnder the key personnel factor, the TORFP  identified eight categories of key personnel \nto be evaluated, including as pertinent here a senior systems engineer.9  TORFP  \nat 63-66.  The solicitation provided qualifications for each key personnel category.  Id. \nat 63, 65.  For the s enior systems engineer, the solicitation listed seven  desired \nqualifications.  Id.   Relevant here, these desired qualifications  included \u201c[a]t least 5 \nyears of hands -on professional experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer for \nprogram\/project of similar size and scope,\u201d and \u201c3 years of experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer supporting a DOD program of similar size and scope.\u201d\n10  Id. at 65.  \nThe TORFP required offerors to provide a resume for each identified key person and \nthe agency was to evaluate \u201cthe extent to which the offeror\u2019s proposed key personnel \nmeet and exceed the desired qualifications.\u201d  Id. at 70.   \n The resume included in OSC\u2019s proposal for its proposed senior systems engineer  \nprovided that the individual had \u201c5+\u201d years of professional experience:  as a \u201cSystems \nEngineer\u201d for [DELETED]  from January 2021 to Present (September 4, 2024); as a \n\u201cWindows System Administrator\/Engineer\u201d for [DELETED]  from August 2020 to January \n2021; and as an \u201cInformation Security Engineer\u201d for [DELETED]  from October 2019 to \nOctober 2020.  AR, Tab 9,  OSC Proposal  at 27 -28. \n \nIn assigning OSC \u2019s proposal  a weakness, the a gency found that the proposed \ncandidate did not meet the qualifications  identified above for DOD experience and \ncollective experience as a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at  46-47.  \nIn this regard, the agency noted that \u201c[t]he desired collective ( [DOD] or otherwise) \nexperience requirement for the position is a least five (5) years of hands -on professional \n \n9 Specifically, the TORFP identified the following key personnel categories:  systems \narchitect and information systems lead (KP 1), network architect and network lead \n(KP2), onsite program manager (KP3), senior infrastructure engineer and infrastructure \nlead (KP4), senior cyber engineer and cyber lead (KP5), senior systems engineer \n(KP6), senior network engineer (KP7), and p roject manager (KP8).  TORFP at 61 -64. \n10 The TORFP also identified the following four additional qualifications\/experience for \nthe senior systems engineer:  a bachelor \u2019s degree in e ngineering, computer science, or \nan IT related field;  a TS level security clearance with the ability to obtain access to SCI ; \nthree years of hands -on professional experience with virtual desktop infrastructure \n(VDI) ; a certified professional (NCP) certification ; and an information assurance \ntechnical\/information assurance manager  (IAT\/IAM ) certification, level II or greater.  Id. \nat 61, 63.  Page 13    B-423287; B -423287.2   experience as a Senior Systems Engineer for a program\/project of similar size and \nscope.\u201d  Id.  at 46.  The agency explained that the \u201ccandidate\u2019s Systems Engineer \nexperience was with [DELETED]  as a Windows System Administrator\/Engineer from \n08\/2020- 01\/2021 and with [DELETED] as a Systems Engineer from 01\/2021- Present. \u201d  \nId.  The agency found that the \u201cnumber of years as a \u2018 Senior Systems Engineer \u2019 cannot \nbe adequately determined from the resume as no Senior -level positions were identified\u201d \nand that \u201c[t]his inexperience as a Senior Systems Engineer does not meet the desired [DOD] experience for the position. \u201d  Id.  The agency also noted that if OSC\u2019s proposed \ncandidate \u201chad Senior Systems Engineering experience and did not necessarily meet the desired timeframe, it would be viewed differently;\u201d \u201c[h]owever, not having the necessary experience as a Senior Systems Engineer AND with only four years as a Systems Engineer does not adequately meet the critical desired experience elements for this position. \u201d  Id. at 46-47.   \n The agency thus concluded that the failure to meet  two of the seven desired \nqualifications increased the risk of unsuccessful performance and warranted a weakness.  Id.  The agency explained that the lack of required experience increased \nrisk because \u201chaving a Systems Engineer filling a Senior Systems Engineer position . . . will likely require more government oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision \nmaking and tasks\u201d and \u201cimpact OSC Edge\u2019s ability to meet project deadlines\u201d in that the \nindividuals filling these senior level positions \u201care expected to lead and manage their own teams within their functional area.\u201d  Id. at 49.    \n In addition, in response to the protest, the agency explains that  it \u201cdoes not dispute that \nthe proposed engineer did the work as described in the proposal,\u201d but rather that  \u201cthe \nnature or type of work performed\u201d  by OSC\u2019s proposed senior systems engineer  as \ndescribed in the resume says nothing about whether the work was done at a senior \nlevel.  COS\/ MOL at 10.  In this regard, the agency notes that a \u201csenior engineer is a \nmore experienced engineer with significantly more responsibility often leading projects , \nhandling complex problems independently, and mentoring junior engineers.\u201d  Id.  The \nagency explains that OSC\u2019s proposed candidate\u2019s resume \u201cdid not call out any higher level technical expertise or leadership experience.\u201d  Id.   The agency states that \u201cOSC's \nproposal identifies his current position as a System Engineer only\u201d and that \u201cthe prior work experiences also identify him as a Systems Engineer vice a Senior Systems Engineer.\u201d  Id.  The agency explains that \u201c[h]aving done the work under the guidance of \na Senior Systems Engineer is not the same as performing and leading as a Senior System Engineer\u201d and that the \u201cwork as described years of experience does not de facto lend itself to a conclusion [that the candidate\u2019s] engineering experience was at the \n\u2018Senior \u2019 level. \u201d  Id.  In this regard, the agency explained in response to the protester\u2019s \ndebriefing questions that  \u201cthe Government was unable to decipher if the proposed \ncandidate was performing [the functions identified in the resume] as a [s]enior [s]yst ems \n[e]ngineer, a [s]ystems [e]ngineer, or under the direction of a [s]enior [s]ystems [e]ngineer.\u201d  AR, Tab 4 , Debriefing Response at 5.  \n The protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s evaluation and maintains that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because  Page 14    B-423287; B -423287.2   its evaluation improperly \u201cfocus[ed] on job titles alone\u201d and \u201c ignore[ ed] [the candidate\u2019s] \nqualifications and experiences on the senior level that was detailed in his resume.\u201d  \nSupp. Comments  at 4, 26.   \n Based on our review we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  The record reflects that this key person\u2019s resume described the candidate as a systems engineer rather than a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 27 -28.  \nThe agency concluded, based on the language in the resume, that it could not determine the number of years of the individual\u2019s experience as a senior systems engineer.   AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 46.   Offerors are  responsible for drafting a well -\nwritten proposal that allow s for meaningful review by the a gency .  Abacus Tech. Corp. ; \nSMS Data Products Grp., Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 201 6, 2016 CPD \u00b6 317 at 17.   \nHere, OSC\u2019s  proposal did not reflect the information that OSC apparently intended to \nconvey .  In assigning OSC a weakness for this aspect of its proposal, the a gency \nconsidered all of th e proposed key individual\u2019s  experience and reasonably concluded \nthat experience increased the risk of unsuccessful performance because his resume did not clearly indicate three years of experience as a senior systems engineer supporting \nDOD and five years of overall experience as a senior systems engineer.  Although OSC \nmay disagree with the a gency\u2019s substantive assessment that OSC did not clearly \ndemonstrate the required years of senior level experience, its disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without  more, is insufficient to establish that the a gency acted \nunreasonably.   \n OSC also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because the TORFP referred to the qualifications as \ndesired, rather than required.  Protest at 26.  We note, however , that the TORFP \nprovided that the agency \u2019s evaluation of proposed key personnel would \u201cconsider the \nextent to which the offeror\u2019s proposed key personnel meet and exceed the desired qualifications ,\u201d TORFP  at 70, and as discussed above, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s \nevaluation that the failure of OSC\u2019s proposal to demonstrate that its proposed senior \nsystems engineer had the desired years of experience as a senior systems engineer increases the risk of unsuccessful performance because  it will likely require more \ngovernment oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision making and tasks and \nmay impact OSC\u2019s ability to meet project deadlines .  Accordingly, it was reasonable for \nthe agency to label its concern regarding OSC\u2019s ability to meet the desired qualifications as a weakness.   This protest ground is denied.  \n  Project Manager  \n OSC also argues that the agency acted unreasonably when it assigned a strength versus a significant strength to its proposed project manager.  Protest at 27.  \nSpecifically, OSC asserts that rather than assess ing an overall strength for  its proposed \nproject manager based on the finding that the project manager exceeded two of the desired qualifications, the agency should have found that  the project manager exceeded \nat least five of the six desired qualifications for that key personnel category and assigned  a significant strength.  Based on our review of the record, we find nothing  Page 15    B-423287; B -423287.2   unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s assessment of a strength, rather than a significant \nstrength, for OSC\u2019s proposed project manager.  However, even if the agency erred in this regard, the protester has failed to show that it was competitively prejudiced by any such error.   \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency \u2019s improper \nactions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  CACI, Inc. -\nFederal; General Dynamics One Source, LLC , B-413860.4 et al. , Jan. 5, 2018, 2018 \nCPD \u00b6 17 at 26- 27.   \n Here, even if the agency erred its evaluation and should have found OSC\u2019s proposed project manager  to exceed five of the six desired requirements for the position, leading \nto a significant strength, rather than a strength,  OSC has not demonstrated  that, but for \nthis error, it s proposal, which was lower rated than SRC\u2019s under both the organizational \nexperience and key personnel factors and which had only a slightly lower evaluated cost,  would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.   Accordingly , we \nconclude that the protester has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s assignment of a strength instead of a significant strength and find no basis to \nsustain the protest.  \n Best-Value Determination \n Finally, OSC argues that because the underlying evaluation was flawed, the agency \u2019s \nbest-value determination was unreasonable.  This allegation is based on the protester \u2019s \nchallenges to the agency \u2019s evaluation, all of which we have denied as set forth above.  \nThus, we dismiss this allegation because the allegations do not establish an \nindependent basis of protest.

OSC \nchallenges the evaluation of the offerors\u2019 organizational experience and key personnel .  \nThe protester also argues that the best -value trade- off determination was unreasonable.   \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On July 24, 2024 , the Navy issued the TORFP to holders of the Navy \u2019s SeaPort Next \nGeneration multiple- award, indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) contract, \npursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 16.  Agency DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  Page 2    B-423287; B -423287.2   Report (AR), Tab 5 , TORFP  at 1.1  The solicitation seeks  proposals to provide t echnical \nengineering and installation services to support a new c ommand and control facility at \nthe U.S. Space C ommand in Colorado Springs, C olorado.  Id. at 73.   The TO RFP \ncontemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order with a 1- year base period \nand four 1- year option periods.  Id. at 13; AR, Tab 7 , Business Clearance Memorandum \n(BCM)  at 4; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL) at 2 . \n \nAward was to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis considering three factors:  \norganizational experience, key personnel,  and cost.2  TORFP at 68.   The organizational \nexperience  factor  was of equal importance to the key personnel evaluation factor.   Id. \nThe non- cost evaluation factors , when combined, were significantly more important than \ncost.  Id.  \n Under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate each offeror\u2019s \nexperience related to five key areas:  key area 1 (hiring and r etaining engineering \nprofessionals ), key  area 2 (enterprise server ), key area 3  (enterprise system \nmanagement ), key area 4  (virtual desktop infrastructure ); and key area 5 (consolidated \ninfrastructure administration) .  Id. at 62.   To demonstrate its experience, each offeror \nwas to provide up to three references.   Id.  Under the key personnel factor, the agency \nwas to evaluate the extent to which the offeror\u2019s proposed key personnel met and exceeded desired qualifications  set forth in the TORFP.  Id. at 70.   \n The Navy  received timely submitted proposals from f ive offerors, including OSC and \nSRC.  AR, Tab 7 , BCM  at 8; COS\/MOL at 4.  After evaluating the proposals, the agency \nassigned OSC\u2019s and SRC\u2019s  proposals the following ratings:\n3 \n \n OSC  SRC  \nAcceptability  Acceptable  Acceptable  \nOrganizational Experience  Good  Outstanding  \nKey Personnel  Good  Outstanding  \nTotal Evaluated Cost  $43,395,597  $44,338,534  \n AR, Tab 7, BCM at 9, 46.  \n \n \n1 Citations to the record are to the documents\u2019 Adobe PDF pagination.  The agency \namended the TORFP twice; all citations to the TORFP are to the consolidated amended version at t ab 5 of the agency report.   \n2 Prior to the evaluation of technical capability and cost, the TORFP also provided for a \ndetermination of acceptability for each offer on a pass\/fail basis.  TORFP at 69- 70. \n3 The agency evaluated proposals under the non- price factors as:  outstanding, good, \nacceptable, marginal or unacceptable.  AR, Tab  8, Source Selection Evaluation Board \nReport (SSEB Report)  at 3.  Page 3    B-423287; B -423287.2   In conducting the best -value tradeoff, the agency found that \u201cSRC\u2019s superior \ndemonstrated organizational experience and [its] ability to provide higher qualified key \npersonnel warrants paying an $868,457.74 or 2% evaluated cost premium over OSC \u2019s \nevaluated cost, across the span of 5- years to a more qualified contractor.\u201d  Id. at 46.  \nThe agency concluded that SRC\u2019s proposal represented the best value to the \ngovernment.  Id.  \n On December 23, 2024, the agency notified OSC that its proposal had not been \nselected for award.  AR, Tab 1, Notice of Award.  After requesting and receiving a \ndebriefing that concluded on January 13, 2025, OSC filed this protest with our Office.\n4 \n DISCUSSION  The protester raises numerous arguments challenging the agency \u2019s evaluation of the \nofferors \u2019 proposals under the organizational experience and key personnel  factors .  For \nexample, the protester challenges a weakness assessed to its proposal under the organizational experience factor.  The protester also contends that the Navy unreasonably failed to assign a significant strength to its proposal under the key \npersonnel factor.  With regard to the awardee, the protester asserts that the agency \nimproperly allow ed SRC to provide more than the three references allowed by the \nsolicitation in support of its organizational experience.  Finally, the protester maintains \nthat the best -value tradeoff was unreasonable.   For the reasons discussed below, we \nfind no basis to sustain the protest.\n5 \n The evaluation of an offeror\u2019s proposal is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion. \nNational Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. , B-401063.2 et al. , Jan. 30, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 59 at 5.  In \nreviewing protests challenging an agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals, our Office does not \nreevaluate proposals or substitute our judgment for that of the agency, but rather examines the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s judgment was reasonable and \nin accord with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  MicroTechnologies, LLC , B-413091, B -413091.2, Aug. 11, 2016, 2016 \nCPD \u00b6 219 at 4 -5.  Agencies must treat all offerors equally and evaluate their proposals \nevenhandedly against the solicitation\u2019 s evaluation criteria.  Cubic Applications, Inc. , \nB-411305, B -411305.2, July 9, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6  218 at 7.  A protester\u2019s disagreement \nwith the agency\u2019s judgment in evaluating proposals or in its determination of the relative merit of competing proposals, without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Veterans Evaluation Servs., Inc. et al. , B-412940 et al. , July 13, 2016, \n2016 CPD \u00b6 185 at 8- 9. \n \n4 The value of the task order is $44 million and is therefore within our jurisdiction to \nreview protests related to the issuance of orders exceeding $3 5 million under multiple-\naward IDIQ contracts issued under the authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).  \n5 Although we do not address all of the protester \u2019s arguments in this decision, we have \nconsidered all of them and any not directly addressed in this decision are without merit.   Page 4    B-423287; B -423287.2    \nOrganizational Experience  OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assessed its proposal with a significant weakness under key area 1 of the organizational experience factor --hiring and r etaining \nengineering professionals --for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain \ncybersecurity and infrastructure engineering professionals .  Specifically, OSC argues \nthe agency ignored language in its proposal.  Protest at 11.  The protester also asserts \nthat the agency improperly  determined that one of OSC\u2019s  contract references was not \nrelevant  to key area 1.   The protester further asserts that in conducting its evaluation, \nthe agency improperly applied an unstated evaluation criterion.  Id. at 13.  As discussed \nbelow, we find none of the protester\u2019s arguments provides a basis to sustain the protest.  \n As noted above, under the o rganizational experience factor, the agency was to evaluate \neach offeror\u2019s experience related to five key areas .  Of relevance here, key area 1 was \nexperience \u201cin hiring and r etaining engineering professionals , specifically Information \nSystems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineer ing, in the Colorado \nSprings, CO area.\u201d\n6  TORFP at 62.   The TORFP specified that offerors must cite at \nleast one reference for work performed by the prime offeror, no more than one reference per subcontractor, and no more than three references total.  Id.   For each \ncited reference, the s olicitation required offerors to submit a r eference information sheet \nin which the offeror would provide a summary description of the contract work, including an explanation of the relevance of each cited reference with respect to one or more of the key areas.  Id.  The agency was to evaluate the breadth, depth and relevance of an \nofferor\u2019s cited organizational experience in the key areas since July 1, 2019.  Id. at 69 . \nThe solicitation made clear that the a gency was \u201cnot bound by an offeror\u2019s opinion of \nthe relevance of its organizational experience.\u201d  Id. at 62. \n In evaluating OSC\u2019s proposal under the organizational experience factor, the agency assessed a significant strength for the enterprise server key area, a significant strength \nfor the enterprise system management key area, a significant strength for the virtual desktop infrastructure key area, a  strength for the consolidated infrastructure \nadministration key area, and a  significant weakness for  the hiring and retaining \nengineering professionals key area, resulting in an overall rating of good for the organiz ational experience factor.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41; AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report \nat 13. \n The agency determined that OSC\u2019s proposal provided one reference relevant to key \narea 1; the reference was for North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD)\/United \nStates Northern Command (NORTHCOM) information technology ( IT) Network \nOperations and Maintenance Support (N2NOMS) --a contract performed by  [DELETED] , \na proposed subcontractor.  AR , Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  This relevant reference \n \n6 The other key areas of experience related to enterprise server support, enterprise \nsystem management support, virtual desktop infrastructure, and consolidated infrastructure administration.  TORFP at 62 .  Page 5    B-423287; B -423287.2   stated that in \u201csupport of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT \nprofessionals including systems engineers, systems administrators, network engineers, \nnetwork administrators, systems architects, database administrators, data center technicians, change managers, and service desk managers. \u201d  Id. (citing AR, Tab 9 , \nOSC Proposal at  13-14).  The reference further stated that, \u201c[i]n support of the long- term \ntask and the project based additional work, [DELETED]  has averaged an 18- month \ntenure on all progr am hires, and our long- term hires have been in place for over three \nyears. \u201d  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  14; Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  \n In evaluating OSC\u2019s proposal, the agency assessed a significant weakness based on two identified flaws.  First, the agency found that although i nformation systems and \nnetwork engineers we re explicitly identified in the  N2NOMS contract, infrastructure or \ncybersecurity engineers we re not , meaning that  OSC had only  partially show n \nexperience hiring engineering professionals in Colorado Springs, C olorado, under the \nN2NOMS contract.  AR, Tab 7, BCM at 41.  Second, the agency found that \u201c[i]n \naddition, [DELETED]  hired 32 contractors throughout this contract (11\/26\/2019 -\n11\/25\/2024) in Colorado Springs but maintains an average of only 13- 15 full -time \nequivalents (p. 13) over the contract\u2019s lifespan. \u201d  Id.  The agency concluded that \u201c[t] his \ndoes not adequately demonstrate [ OSC\u2019s ] ability to retain the needed engineering \ntalent. \u201d  Id.  In making this determination, the agency noted that \u201c[t] he ability to hire AND \nretain technical engineering talent in the Colorado Springs area is crucial for the successful performance of this [U.S. Space Command]  requirement. \u201d  Id. \n The protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s evaluation, arguing that the agency \ndisregarded or misconstrued the proposal \u2019s description of [DELETED] \u2019s experience \nretaining professionals under the N2NOMS contract  when assigning the significant \nweakness .  Protest at 11 -13.  OSC maintains that because its proposal indicated the \nhiring of 32 IT professionals , but an average of only 13- 15 full time equivalents ( FTEs ) \nover the period of performance, the agency  incorrectly  assumed that a large number of \nthe hires were not being retained.  Rather, per the protester, the clear language of \nOSC\u2019s  proposal should have led the agency to determine that the disparity between the \ntwo numbers is attributable to the fact that a number of the 32 hires were short term employees hired to meet surge requirements.  \n In support of its argument, OSC points to the following description in its proposal of its \nsubcontractor \u2019s recruitment and retention experience under the N2NOMS contract : \n \n[DELETED]  averages 13- 15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the life of the \ncontract and has also provided additional head count and support for project -based surge and specialized resources for implementations and \ntesting of new systems or technologies.  Over the life of the contract, we \nhave hired 32 contractors to support this effort.  \nProtest at 11 (citing AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 13 ). \n \nOSC asserts that this language in its proposal meant that \u201c the contract requires \n[DELETED]  to hire and retain a permanent staff the size of 13- 15 FTEs, which the  Page 6    B-423287; B -423287.2   subcontractor fulfilled.\u201d  Protest at 11 -12.  The protester further asserts that \u201c[i]n addition \nto this regular workforce, to support \u2018project -based surge and specialized resources for \nimplementation and testing of new systems or technologies, \u2019\u201d its proposal explained that \n\u201c[DELETED]  \u2018also provided additional head count.\u2019\u201d  Protest at 12 (citing AR, Tab 9, \nOSC Proposal at 11).  From this, OSC argues that its proposal clearly demonstrated \nthat [DELETED]  hired a total of 32 IT professionals that were a mix of  long- term and \nsurge employees.  Id. at 12.  The agency responds that OSC\u2019s proposal lacked clear \nand definitive retention information necessary to adequately demonstrate their ability to \nretain the needed engineering talent.  COS\/MOL at 7.  \n Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  The record shows that OSC\u2019s proposal stated that \u201cin support of the N2NOMS contract, [DELETED]  has hired 32 IT professionals[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at  13.  It also \nstated that [DELETED]  maintains on average \u201c 13-15 FTEs on an ongoing basis over the \nlife of the contract .\u201d  Id.  Contrary to OSC\u2019s argument, the proposal does not provide a \n\u201cclear representation about [DELETED] \u2019 staff retention experience under the N2NOMS \ncontract.\u201d  Protest at  11.  As the agency explains in response to the protest , OSC\u2019s \nproposal did not connect the delta between overall number of staff hired for the contract and the average \u201congoing\u201d FTEs to surge requirements, as OSC argues in the protest.  Protest at 11; COS\/ MOL at 6.  Specifically, although OSC\u2019s proposal  also states that \n[DELETED]  \u201cprovided additional head count and support for project -based surge,\u201d the \nproposal never states that any of the \u201chired 32 IT professionals,\u201d of which [DELETED]  \nretained only \u201c13- 15 FTES on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract,\u201d were surge \nemployees.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Pro posal  at 13.  It is an offeror \u2019s responsibility to submit a \nwell-written proposal, with adequately detailed information, which clearly demonstrates \ncompliance with the solicitation requirements and allows for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Tribalco, LLC , B-421837.3, Feb. 5, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 49 at 6.  Here, \nto the extent OSC wanted the agency to know that the difference between the 32 hired \nemployees and the 13-15 average FTEs  is due to roughly 17 of the hired employees \nbeing surge support , then it was incumbent upon OSC to adequately explain this in its \nproposal.  OSC\u2019s proposal failed to do so.  As such, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.\n7  The protest ground is denied.  \n \n7 In a supplemental protest, OSC also claims the agency disparately evaluated the \nofferors\u2019 stated retention rates.  Comments  & Supp. Protest  at 16- 19.  According to \nOSC, the agency\u2019s comparison of OSC\u2019s and SRC\u2019s retention rates \u201ccannot be fair\u201d because the agency accepted SRC\u2019s stated 82.1 percent  retention rate without \nquestioning how it was calculated,  but arbitrarily calculated OSC\u2019s retention rate based \non the assumption that [DELETED]  hired 32 IT professional s but only retained 13- 15 of \nthem on the N2NOMS contract.  Id. at 17.  While OSC contends that t his argument is \nbased on the agency\u2019s comparison of retention rates in the Business Clearance Memorandum, see id., the agency provided OSC with the exact same information in the \ndebriefing.  Compare AR, Tab 7, BCM at 40- 42, with AR, Tab 3, OSC Debrief  at 49.  As \nsuch, OSC was required to raise this argument within ten days of the debriefing.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a); Supp. COS\/ MOL  at 4-5.  Because OSC first presented this \n(continued...)   Page 7    B-423287; B -423287.2    Unstated Evaluation Criterion \n \nOSC also asserts  that the agency applied an unstated evaluation criterion under \norganizational experience key area 1 when highlighting that its proposal\u2019s description of \nthe N2NOMS contract does not reflect experience hiring infrastructure or cybersecurity engineers.  Protest at 13-16.  This argument stems from the agency\u2019s answer to one of \nOSC\u2019s debriefing questions regarding the key area 1 evaluation wherein the agency stated that there was insufficient detail in OSC\u2019s proposal regarding the program hires or long- term hires, for example, identification of the \u201clabor categories for these \u2018hires.\u2019\u201d  \nAR, Tab 4, Debriefing Answers  at 3.  OSC asserts there was no evaluation criteri on for \nthis key area that required identification of labor categories with respect to hiring and retention, and therefore, to the extent that  OSC\u2019s evaluation was based on the failure of \nOSC\u2019s proposal to provide \u201clabor categories\u201d for the 32 hires , it reflects an unstated \nevaluation criteri on.  Protest at  13.   \n The agency responds that, in its answer to the debriefing question, the agency was \u201cmerely trying to explain to OSC what type of information may have assisted in making the information it did provide more meaningful for evaluation.\u201d   COS\/MOL at 7 -8.  In this \nregard, the agency explains that it did not assess the weakness based on the failure of \nOSC\u2019s proposal  to include labor categories, but rather, that the identified flaw was \nbased on the failure of OSC\u2019s proposal to provide any information regarding the retention of infrastructure or cybersecurity engineering talent as required by the solicitation.  Id.  at 7. \n Based on our review, we find that the agency\u2019s evaluation was not based on an \nunstated evaluation criterion.  T he TORFP  expressly required offerors to demonstrate \nexperience hiring and retaining specific engineering positions relevant to the work to be performed in the Colorado Springs area, specifically including infrastructure and \ncybersecurity engineering positions .  TORFP at 6 2.  As noted above, the agency \nidentified a flaw because OSC\u2019s proposal failed to demonstrate that [DELETED]  had \nexperience hiring and retaining infrastructure engineers and cybersecurity engineers  \nunder the N2NOMS contract .  While the protester alleges that the agency improperly \nassessed a flaw to it s proposal for failing to identify labor categories for the 32 hires, the \nprotester has failed to demonstrate, and there is no indication in the evaluation record,  \nthat the agency evaluated or expected offerors to provide information regarding labor categories.  The agency\u2019s evaluation was consistent with the solicitation and reasonable.  Accordingly, t his protest ground is denied.  \n \n \nargument as a supplemental protest on March 3, 2025, nearly two months after the debriefing, the argument is dismissed as untimely.    Page 8    B-423287; B -423287.2    Relevance of Reference \n \nAs noted above, relevant to the hiring and r etaining engineering professionals  key area, \nthe agency determined that OSC\u2019s proposal provided one relevant reference for its \nsubcontractor,  [DELETED] .  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 11.  OSC argues the agency \nunreasonably found not relevant its second reference,  which was for Information \nTechnology Infrastructure Support 3 (ITIS3) for the U.S. Army, Human Resources Command (HRC) at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Indianapolis, Indiana.  Protest at 16- 17. \n The solicitation provided clear requirements regarding what experience the agency was \nto evaluate under the organizational experience factor in each key area and the relevant timeframe for such experience.  TORFP at 62 .  The solicitation required offerors to \n\u201cindicate the breadth, depth and relevance of your organizational experience since 01 July 2019\u201d and,  for key area 1,  to demonstrate \u201c[e]xperience in hiring and retaining \nengineering professionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.\u201d  Id.   Accordingly, the \nsolicitation expressly identified the type of engineering positions and performance location that would be considered relevant to key area 1.  \n When evaluating OSC\u2019s proposal against these criteria, the agency determined that OSC\u2019s HRC contract was not relevant to key area 1 because the place of performance \nwas Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Indianapolis, Indiana, whereas the contract awarded under the solicitation here will be performed in the Colorado Springs area.  AR, Tab 8, \nSSEB Report at 11.  \n \nOSC argues that this finding reflects an unstated evaluation criterion because \u201c[t]here is no mention in the [ s]olicitation that the recruitment and retention experience has to be \nexplicitly for in -person staff in the Colorado Springs area.\u201d\n8  Protest at 18.  OSC further \nmaintains that the HRC contract was relevant because even though the contract was not performed in Colorado Springs, \u201csome\u201d staff for unidentified positions were recruited \n \n8 In its supplemental protest, OSC also contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation \u201cgives \nrise to a latent ambiguity\u201d because the solicitation did not specifically require experience hiring in -person IT professionals, and it was reasonable for OSC to believe hiring \nremote workers would be relevant.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 16.  In response, the \nagency argues that OSC\u2019s latent ambiguity argument relies \u201con the same facts that OSC was aware of when it made its initial unstated evaluation criteria argument in its protest.\u201d  Supp. COS\/MOL  at 2-3.  That is, both OSC\u2019s unstated evaluation criteria \nargument and its latent ambiguity argument are based on the a gency finding the HRC \ncontract not relevant because its place of performance was not the Colorado Springs area--a finding of which OSC was made aware in its debriefing.  AR, Tab 3, OSC \nDebrief at 3.  Accordingly, to be timely, OSC would have needed to raise its latent \nambiguity argument in its initial protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  Because OSC did not \nmake this argument until it submitted its comments 49 days after the a gency responded \nto OSC\u2019s debriefing questions, this argument is dismissed as untimely .  Page 9    B-423287; B -423287.2   from the area and work ed remotely from Colorado Springs .  See id.  at 17.   In support of \nits position, OSC quotes two lines from its proposal:  \n \nOSC Edge staffs the HRC ITIS3 contract with engineering professionals.  \nOur staff is a combination of onsite and remote and we do have staff in the Colorado Springs area to include key personnel.  \nId. (quoting AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal  at 7).  \n \nThe agency  maintains that \u201chiring and retention in Colorado Springs for a contract with a \nplace of performance on- site logically encompasses looking at an offeror\u2019s ability to hire \nand retain in that capacity.\u201d  COS\/ MOL at 9.  In this regard, the agency further explains \nin response to the protest that \u201c[t]he capacity to hire and retain engineering \nprofessionals, specifically Information Systems, Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO  area for an onsite requirement \nis not an equivalent to the capacity to hire and retain for telework in Colorado Springs.\u201d  Id.   \n Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  While the protester contends that the solicitation evaluation criteria for hiring and retaining engineering professionals did not require demonstration of recruitment and retention experience explicitly for in- person staff in the Colorado Springs area, we do \nnot find that the agency\u2019s determination that the HRC contract was not relevant on this basis was improper.  In evaluating a proposal, an agency properly may take into \naccount specific, albeit not expressly identified, matters that are logically encompassed \nby or related to the stated evaluation criteria.  Preferred Sys. Sols. , B-291750, Feb. 24, \n2003, 2003 CPD \u00b6 56 at 2.   \n The record shows that while OSC\u2019s reference demonstrated the capacity to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs who were willing to telework, it failed to demonstrate the \nability to hire and retain staff in Colorado Springs for an onsite assignment.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 7.  Because an offeror\u2019s ability to hire and retain staff to work on- site in \nColorado Springs is logically encompassed within the evaluation criteria, which expressly identify the performance location that would be considered relev ant to key \narea 1, it was reasonable for the agency to find that OSC\u2019s HRC reference was not relevant for failing to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain staff on- site in Colorado \nSprings.   TORFP at 62.   As such, we find that the agency\u2019s evaluation--including \nconsideration of an offeror\u2019s ability to demonstrate hiring and retention for on- site work \nin the Colorado Springs area in assessing relevance--is not based on an unstated \nevaluation criterion.  While the protester may disagree with  the agency\u2019s  assessment of \nrelevance for its HRC reference, such disagreement, without more, is insufficient to establish that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.  FreeAlliance.com, LLC , \nB-414531, June 19, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 191  at 5.  As such, t his protest ground is denied.  \n  Page 10    B-423287; B -423287.2    Awardee\u2019s Organizational Experience References  \n \nThe solicitation specified that offerors could provide \u201cno more than three references \ntotal\u201d in support of their organizational experience.  TORFP at 6 2.  One of the awardee\u2019s \nreferences was for  its C2 Mission Services (C2 Cyber) t ask order No. N6600123F0062 \nunder SRC \u2019s Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific  IDIQ contract.  AR, Tab  11, SRC \nProposal at 3.  OSC argues that the agency\u2019s evaluation of SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber  reference \nwas unreasonable because the evaluation noted that SRC started hiring IT professionals for the task order  two years before the task order began in November \n2022.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 33.  OSC claims that the agency improperly \ncredited SRC for hiring and retention experience that took place before the C2 Cyber  \ntask order began--essentially asserting that SRC attempted to bootstrap other efforts external to the C2 Cyber  task order to its C2 Cyber  reference, thereby allowing SRC to \nprovide more than the three references allowed by the solicitation.  Id.  at 33- 36.   \n As noted previously, the TORFP defined  the hiring and r etaining engineering \nprofessionals  key area as recent (since July  1, 2019) \u201c[e]xperience in hiring and \nretaining engineering professionals, specifically I nformation Systems, Network, \nInfrastructure, and C ybersecurity engineering, in the Colorado Springs, CO area.\u201d  \nTORFP at 62 .  In SRC\u2019s reference for the C2 Cyber  task order, SRC cites its \u201csupport [ ] \n[for] the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNO RTHCOM) (N- NC) Cyberspace Operations \nDirectorate (J6) Mission Systems Support Team since November 2020. \u201d  AR, Tab 11, \nSRC Proposal at 4.   \n \nIn addition, SRC\u2019s proposal states that it has also \u201csupported the United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) J6 Directorate\u2019s Consolidated Space Operations Facility Team (J6X) and J6 Cyber (J6C) since February 2021, on [C2 Cyber] [t]ask [o]rder (TO) N6600123F0062.\u201d  Id.   In this regard, SRC notes that \u201cSRC has teamed with \n[DELETED]  and [DELETED]  to provide the Government with the ultimate combination of \nflexibility, technical expertise, and tailored staffing in Colorado Springs.\u201d   Id.  \nSpecifically, SRC\u2019s pr oposal states that, in order to \u201covercome the challenges of staffing \nin the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the Department of Defense [(DOD)],\u201d it has, \u201c[s]ince November 2020, [ ] hired 35 IT professionals in the \nColorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering.\u201d  Id.  SRC also states that, for \nthis task order, it \u201csuccessfully staffed six uniquely qualified Full -Time Equivalent (FTE) \nIS and Cybersecurity engineering positions --each with Top Secret (TS) security \nclearances and eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) read- in.\u201d  Id.   \n In evaluating SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber  reference, the agency found that \u201c SRC has demonstrated \nsuccessful staffing and retention in the Colorado Springs area for the Department of Defense\u201d, noting that \u201c[s]ince November 2020, SRC has hired 35 IT professionals in the Colorado Springs area, 27 of which are specialized in Information Systems (IS), Network, Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity engineering. \u201d  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 7.  \n  Page 11    B-423287; B -423287.2   OSC disagrees with the agency\u2019s evaluation and asserts that SRC\u2019s proposal included \n\u201can indeterminate number of experience references,\u201d and that the agency unreasonably credited SRC for three years of performance by itself and other companies prior to the beginning of the C2 Cyber  task order.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 35.   In response, \nthe agency explains that SRC\u2019s proposal simply demonstrated how SRC hired and retained personnel for the C2 Cyber  task order.  Supp. COS\/ MOL at 7.  The agency \nmaintains that \u201c [w]hether SRC hired these employees before or during the task order is \nimmaterial\u201d because \u201cthe fact [is] that [SRC was ] able to hire and retain for performance \nunder\u201d the C2 Cyber  task order.  Id.    \n Based on our review, we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  The record reflects  that SRC\u2019s partnerships with the two [DELETED]  companies and the \nhiring discussed in SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber reference was in support of the C2 Cyber  task \norder.  While OSC is correct that the task order in SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber  reference did not \nbegin until November 2022, this does not mean that hiring was not conducted in anticipation of the task order.  Although the relevant task order did not begin until \nNovember 2022, SRC \u2019s proposal explains that it  started recruiting in November 2020 in \nanticipation of the task order to \u201covercome the challenges of staffing in the competitive and dynamic [IT] market in Colorado Springs for the [DOD].\u201d  AR, Tab 11, SRC \nProposal  at 4.  While OSC asserts that SRC should not have received credit for the \nhiring that occurred prior to the start of the task order because the hiring was not done under the task order, as previously noted, the solicitation required offerors to provide \u201corganiz ational experience since 01 July 201 9,\u201d and key area 1 required experience \nhiring and retaining certain engineering professional in the Colorado Springs area.  TORFP at 62 .  The protester neither asserts nor cites to any requirement in the \nsolicitation that specified that this hiring and retaining experience had to be obtained \nexclusively during a reference\u2019s period of performance to be relevant or a prohibition on hiring and retaining experience in anticipation of performing a reference contract.  Supp. Comments at 5-12; TORFP at 6 2.  To the extent OSC asserts that it was improper for \nthe agency to have considered SRC\u2019s experience in this regard as relevant to SRC\u2019s C2 Cyber task order, the protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation, without \nmore, is insufficient to render the agency\u2019s evaluation unreasonable.  This protest ground is denied.   Key Personnel  \n OSC argues that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposal under the key personnel factor for its proposed senior systems engineer.  OSC also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the qualifications of  its proposed program \nmanager , asserting that  OSC\u2019s proposal merited a significant strength, rather than just a \nstrength.     Senior Systems Engineer  \n OSC argues that the a gency\u2019s evaluation under the key personnel factor  was \nunreasonable based on the assignment of a weakness for OSC\u2019s proposed senior  Page 12    B-423287; B -423287.2   systems engineer.  OSC alleges that the a gency unreasonably assigned it s proposal  a \nweakness because it concluded that its proposed senior systems engineer  did not meet \ntwo of the solicitation\u2019s seven desired experience areas  for the position.  Protest \nat 18-26.  OSC contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation was improper because, in its \nview, the resume of its proposed senior systems engineer  \u201creadily meets or exceeds the \n[a]gency\u2019s evaluation criteria\u201d and the a gency either misread or rigidly read OSC\u2019s \npropos al.  Id. at 18. \n \nUnder the key personnel factor, the TORFP  identified eight categories of key personnel \nto be evaluated, including as pertinent here a senior systems engineer.9  TORFP  \nat 63-66.  The solicitation provided qualifications for each key personnel category.  Id. \nat 63, 65.  For the s enior systems engineer, the solicitation listed seven  desired \nqualifications.  Id.   Relevant here, these desired qualifications  included \u201c[a]t least 5 \nyears of hands -on professional experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer for \nprogram\/project of similar size and scope,\u201d and \u201c3 years of experience as [a] Senior Systems Engineer supporting a DOD program of similar size and scope.\u201d\n10  Id. at 65.  \nThe TORFP required offerors to provide a resume for each identified key person and \nthe agency was to evaluate \u201cthe extent to which the offeror\u2019s proposed key personnel \nmeet and exceed the desired qualifications.\u201d  Id. at 70.   \n The resume included in OSC\u2019s proposal for its proposed senior systems engineer  \nprovided that the individual had \u201c5+\u201d years of professional experience:  as a \u201cSystems \nEngineer\u201d for [DELETED]  from January 2021 to Present (September 4, 2024); as a \n\u201cWindows System Administrator\/Engineer\u201d for [DELETED]  from August 2020 to January \n2021; and as an \u201cInformation Security Engineer\u201d for [DELETED]  from October 2019 to \nOctober 2020.  AR, Tab 9,  OSC Proposal  at 27 -28. \n \nIn assigning OSC \u2019s proposal  a weakness, the a gency found that the proposed \ncandidate did not meet the qualifications  identified above for DOD experience and \ncollective experience as a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at  46-47.  \nIn this regard, the agency noted that \u201c[t]he desired collective ( [DOD] or otherwise) \nexperience requirement for the position is a least five (5) years of hands -on professional \n \n9 Specifically, the TORFP identified the following key personnel categories:  systems \narchitect and information systems lead (KP 1), network architect and network lead \n(KP2), onsite program manager (KP3), senior infrastructure engineer and infrastructure \nlead (KP4), senior cyber engineer and cyber lead (KP5), senior systems engineer \n(KP6), senior network engineer (KP7), and p roject manager (KP8).  TORFP at 61 -64. \n10 The TORFP also identified the following four additional qualifications\/experience for \nthe senior systems engineer:  a bachelor \u2019s degree in e ngineering, computer science, or \nan IT related field;  a TS level security clearance with the ability to obtain access to SCI ; \nthree years of hands -on professional experience with virtual desktop infrastructure \n(VDI) ; a certified professional (NCP) certification ; and an information assurance \ntechnical\/information assurance manager  (IAT\/IAM ) certification, level II or greater.  Id. \nat 61, 63.  Page 13    B-423287; B -423287.2   experience as a Senior Systems Engineer for a program\/project of similar size and \nscope.\u201d  Id.  at 46.  The agency explained that the \u201ccandidate\u2019s Systems Engineer \nexperience was with [DELETED]  as a Windows System Administrator\/Engineer from \n08\/2020- 01\/2021 and with [DELETED] as a Systems Engineer from 01\/2021- Present. \u201d  \nId.  The agency found that the \u201cnumber of years as a \u2018 Senior Systems Engineer \u2019 cannot \nbe adequately determined from the resume as no Senior -level positions were identified\u201d \nand that \u201c[t]his inexperience as a Senior Systems Engineer does not meet the desired [DOD] experience for the position. \u201d  Id.  The agency also noted that if OSC\u2019s proposed \ncandidate \u201chad Senior Systems Engineering experience and did not necessarily meet the desired timeframe, it would be viewed differently;\u201d \u201c[h]owever, not having the necessary experience as a Senior Systems Engineer AND with only four years as a Systems Engineer does not adequately meet the critical desired experience elements for this position. \u201d  Id. at 46-47.   \n The agency thus concluded that the failure to meet  two of the seven desired \nqualifications increased the risk of unsuccessful performance and warranted a weakness.  Id.  The agency explained that the lack of required experience increased \nrisk because \u201chaving a Systems Engineer filling a Senior Systems Engineer position . . . will likely require more government oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision \nmaking and tasks\u201d and \u201cimpact OSC Edge\u2019s ability to meet project deadlines\u201d in that the \nindividuals filling these senior level positions \u201care expected to lead and manage their own teams within their functional area.\u201d  Id. at 49.    \n In addition, in response to the protest, the agency explains that  it \u201cdoes not dispute that \nthe proposed engineer did the work as described in the proposal,\u201d but rather that  \u201cthe \nnature or type of work performed\u201d  by OSC\u2019s proposed senior systems engineer  as \ndescribed in the resume says nothing about whether the work was done at a senior \nlevel.  COS\/ MOL at 10.  In this regard, the agency notes that a \u201csenior engineer is a \nmore experienced engineer with significantly more responsibility often leading projects , \nhandling complex problems independently, and mentoring junior engineers.\u201d  Id.  The \nagency explains that OSC\u2019s proposed candidate\u2019s resume \u201cdid not call out any higher level technical expertise or leadership experience.\u201d  Id.   The agency states that \u201cOSC's \nproposal identifies his current position as a System Engineer only\u201d and that \u201cthe prior work experiences also identify him as a Systems Engineer vice a Senior Systems Engineer.\u201d  Id.  The agency explains that \u201c[h]aving done the work under the guidance of \na Senior Systems Engineer is not the same as performing and leading as a Senior System Engineer\u201d and that the \u201cwork as described years of experience does not de facto lend itself to a conclusion [that the candidate\u2019s] engineering experience was at the \n\u2018Senior \u2019 level. \u201d  Id.  In this regard, the agency explained in response to the protester\u2019s \ndebriefing questions that  \u201cthe Government was unable to decipher if the proposed \ncandidate was performing [the functions identified in the resume] as a [s]enior [s]yst ems \n[e]ngineer, a [s]ystems [e]ngineer, or under the direction of a [s]enior [s]ystems [e]ngineer.\u201d  AR, Tab 4 , Debriefing Response at 5.  \n The protester disagrees with the agency\u2019s evaluation and maintains that the agency unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because  Page 14    B-423287; B -423287.2   its evaluation improperly \u201cfocus[ed] on job titles alone\u201d and \u201c ignore[ ed] [the candidate\u2019s] \nqualifications and experiences on the senior level that was detailed in his resume.\u201d  \nSupp. Comments  at 4, 26.   \n Based on our review we find nothing unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s evaluation.  The record reflects that this key person\u2019s resume described the candidate as a systems engineer rather than a senior systems engineer.  AR, Tab 9, OSC Proposal at 27 -28.  \nThe agency concluded, based on the language in the resume, that it could not determine the number of years of the individual\u2019s experience as a senior systems engineer.   AR, Tab 8, SSEB Report at 46.   Offerors are  responsible for drafting a well -\nwritten proposal that allow s for meaningful review by the a gency .  Abacus Tech. Corp. ; \nSMS Data Products Grp., Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 201 6, 2016 CPD \u00b6 317 at 17.   \nHere, OSC\u2019s  proposal did not reflect the information that OSC apparently intended to \nconvey .  In assigning OSC a weakness for this aspect of its proposal, the a gency \nconsidered all of th e proposed key individual\u2019s  experience and reasonably concluded \nthat experience increased the risk of unsuccessful performance because his resume did not clearly indicate three years of experience as a senior systems engineer supporting \nDOD and five years of overall experience as a senior systems engineer.  Although OSC \nmay disagree with the a gency\u2019s substantive assessment that OSC did not clearly \ndemonstrate the required years of senior level experience, its disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment, without  more, is insufficient to establish that the a gency acted \nunreasonably.   \n OSC also argues that it was unreasonable for the agency to assign a weakness to its proposed senior systems engineer because the TORFP referred to the qualifications as \ndesired, rather than required.  Protest at 26.  We note, however , that the TORFP \nprovided that the agency \u2019s evaluation of proposed key personnel would \u201cconsider the \nextent to which the offeror\u2019s proposed key personnel meet and exceed the desired qualifications ,\u201d TORFP  at 70, and as discussed above, we find reasonable the agency\u2019s \nevaluation that the failure of OSC\u2019s proposal to demonstrate that its proposed senior \nsystems engineer had the desired years of experience as a senior systems engineer increases the risk of unsuccessful performance because  it will likely require more \ngovernment oversight and involvement in day -to-day decision making and tasks and \nmay impact OSC\u2019s ability to meet project deadlines .  Accordingly, it was reasonable for \nthe agency to label its concern regarding OSC\u2019s ability to meet the desired qualifications as a weakness.   This protest ground is denied.  \n  Project Manager  \n OSC also argues that the agency acted unreasonably when it assigned a strength versus a significant strength to its proposed project manager.  Protest at 27.  \nSpecifically, OSC asserts that rather than assess ing an overall strength for  its proposed \nproject manager based on the finding that the project manager exceeded two of the desired qualifications, the agency should have found that  the project manager exceeded \nat least five of the six desired qualifications for that key personnel category and assigned  a significant strength.  Based on our review of the record, we find nothing  Page 15    B-423287; B -423287.2   unreasonable regarding the agency\u2019s assessment of a strength, rather than a significant \nstrength, for OSC\u2019s proposed project manager.  However, even if the agency erred in this regard, the protester has failed to show that it was competitively prejudiced by any such error.   \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest, and we will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency \u2019s improper \nactions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  CACI, Inc. -\nFederal; General Dynamics One Source, LLC , B-413860.4 et al. , Jan. 5, 2018, 2018 \nCPD \u00b6 17 at 26- 27.   \n Here, even if the agency erred its evaluation and should have found OSC\u2019s proposed project manager  to exceed five of the six desired requirements for the position, leading \nto a significant strength, rather than a strength,  OSC has not demonstrated  that, but for \nthis error, it s proposal, which was lower rated than SRC\u2019s under both the organizational \nexperience and key personnel factors and which had only a slightly lower evaluated cost,  would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.   Accordingly , we \nconclude that the protester has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s assignment of a strength instead of a significant strength and find no basis to \nsustain the protest.  \n Best-Value Determination \n Finally, OSC argues that because the underlying evaluation was flawed, the agency \u2019s \nbest-value determination was unreasonable.  This allegation is based on the protester \u2019s \nchallenges to the agency \u2019s evaluation, all of which we have denied as set forth above.  \nThus, we dismiss this allegation because the allegations do not establish an \nindependent basis of protest.

        "Summary":"Protest that agency misevaluated quotations and made an unreasonable source selection decision to issue task order to higher -rated and higher -cost vendor is denied \nwhere the record shows the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with law, \nregulation, and the terms of the solicitation.   \nDECISION  \n Kratos Defense & Rocket Support Services, Inc., of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of a task order to Salient CRGT, Inc., of Fairfax, Virginia, under request for quotations  (RFQ) No. N0018924R3085, issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval \nSupply Systems Command, for educational support services  and logistical support \nservices for the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF)  at multiple locations in the Kingdom \nof Saudi Arabia.  Kratos contends that the Navy misevaluated quotations  and made an \nunreasonable source selection decision.   \n We deny the protest.   \n BACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the RFQ on July 25, 2024, to firms holding the Navy\u2019s SeaPort Next \nGeneration multiple- award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts , and \ndesignated the procurement a fair opportunity competition pursuant to Federal DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2    B-423376 et al.   Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505(b).  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFQ  \namend. 3 at 5.1  The RFQ  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order \nfor a base year  and four option years, plus an option for 15 days of demobilization \nservices to facilitate a transition to a successor contractor.  AR, Tab 1, RFQ at 52.   The \nRFQ incorporated a performance work statement (PWS) that described the scope of the \ntask order as assisting the N aval Education and Training Security Assistance Field \nActivity  (NETSAFA) by providing RSNF support services that would include training and \neducation, engineering, technical , and management support .  Id. at 16.  These services \nare to focus on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of directly supporting \u201c the \nRSNF \u2019s objective to remain the dominant Naval Force within the Middle East ,\u201d and are \nto include support for \u201call levels of in -Kingdom RSNF training and other logistical and \nadvisory support .\u201d  Id.   \n \nThe RFQ  provided for quotations2 to be evaluated under three factors .  The first, \nperformance approach, was more important than the second, past performance, and together those were more important than the third, cost.  RFQ at 51.  The successful \nvendor would be selected using a best value tradeoff among those factors.  Id.  \n For the performance approach factor, the RFQ instructed vendors to describe the firm \u2019s \napproach only under five specific PWS task elements , four of which are relevant here:  \n \n\u2022 PWS 1.1.2, which required the vendor to m anage teams of task order \nsupport personnel at multiple geographically dispersed locations.    \n\u2022 PWS 2.1.1.1, which required the vendor to \u201c [a]ssist the RSNF in the \nestablishment of a central Curriculum Management organization within the Learning Education Center in Riyadh with a focus on Learning Standards and Quality Control .\u201d \n\u2022 PWS 2.1.1.3, which required the vendor to \u201cperform annual analysis of \nthe state of the RSNF Curriculum Management process and provide results and recommendation of Short (12\/24 month) and Long (3-5 year) term goals ,\u201d and then deliver a report with the results .   \n\u2022 PWS 5, which required the vendor to offer a program \u201cto hire Saudi \nArabian Nationals  . . . in support of the new Saudi Arabian 2030 Vision \nPlan through performance of this requirement ,\u201d so that the vendor \nwould maintain  a \u201cminimum rating of \u2018 Medium Green\u2019  in the Saudi \n \n1 The solicitation was issued as a request for proposals but is referred to as an RFQ in \namendment 1.  Vendors \u2019 submissions are referred to as both quotations and proposals \nin the evaluation record and in the parties \u2019 protest filings.  For consistency, we refer to \nthe solicitation as an RFQ and to the vendors \u2019 submissions as quotations.  \n2 The Navy previously determined that three of seven interested firms were considered \nto be \u201c viable \u201d sources based on their experience, commitment, and eligibility to operate \nin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and invited those three to submit quotations.    Page 3    B-423376 et al.   Nitaqat Mutawar Program \u201d and meet the corresponding requirements \nof the national social insurance program.   \n \nRFQ at 16- 20, 46.   \nThe RFQ also expressly advised vendors that they could \u201c provide any other information \nconsidered relevant to the solicitation and PWS tasks .\u201d  Id. at 46.   \n Under the past performance factor, the RFQ directed vendors to submit three past performance references with the same or similar scope and magnitude that would be evaluated to assess \u201c how capable the [vendor] is of successfully accomplishing the \nrequirements of the solicitation. \u201d  Id. at 46- 47.  \n For the cost factor, which is not at issue here, the RFQ directed vendors to submit target costs and target fees using a web form, and documentation substantiating the \nrealism of the vendor \u2019s direct labor rates  and indirect rates .  Id. at 48 -49.  \n The three quotations the Navy received were from Salient\n3, Kratos , and a third firm that \nis not at issue here.  A technical evaluation board (TEB) reviewed the quotations , \nidentified strengths and weaknesses in each vendor \u2019s proposed approach under the \nperformance approach factor, and assessed adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, \nacceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  AR, Tab 4, TEB Memorandum4 at 5.  The TEB \nalso evaluated each vendor \u2019s past performance to assess first the relevance of each \nreference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant, and then all \nreferences together in aggregate.  The TEB then assess ed each vendor \u2019s record of \nperformance under its relevant contracts , which was expressed in terms of a level of \nconfidence in the vendor performing successfully .  The past performance evaluation \nresulted in adjectival ratings that included substantial confidence, satisfactory \nconfidence, and limited confidence.  Id. at 5-6.   \n \nThe Navy identified two weaknesses in the Kratos \u2019s approach under the performance \napproach factor.  The first weakness concerned Kratos \u2019s approach to managing teams \nof personnel under PWS section 1.1.2 that included having the firm \u2019s managers \ncommunicate with RSNF leadership about academic schedules and requirements \nwithout including NETSAFA.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  6-7.  The s econd weakness \nconcerned the firm\u2019 s approach to supporting curriculum management under PWS \nsections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 by proposi ng the use of Kratos \u2019s proprietary software, \nreferred to as [DELETED] , rather than commercial ly available software .  The TEB \nexplained that the use of proprietary software created a risk of vendor lock -in, a \nsituation where RSNF curriculum management would become reliant on the proprietary \n \n3 Salient is the corporate parent of the incumbent contractor , Salient Federal SGIS.    \n4 The TEB produced both a report document ing the evaluation judgments, and a \nmemorandum to the contracting officer, which described the evaluation process and summarized the results.    Page 4    B-423376 et al.   software and would complicate efforts to achieve future competition for the requirement.  \nId. at 9.  Although the TEB also identified strengths in Kratos \u2019s approach regarding the \nsame PWS requirements,  it determined the quotation merited an overall rating of \nacceptable under the performance approach factor.  Id.  at 12-13.   \nIn contrast, the TEB \u2019s evaluation of Salient \u2019s quotation found the firm \u2019s approach \nshowed exceptional understanding and demonstrated the ability to exceed program \nrequirements.  Id. at 19 -21.  The evaluation identified multiple strengths and no \nweaknesses, which the TEB determined merited an overall rating of outstanding under \nthe performance approach factor .  Id. at 29-30.  \n In evaluating Kratos under the past performance factor, the Navy determined that two of \nthe firm\u2019 s past performance examples were very relevant, and one was somewhat \nrelevant, and that  when considered in aggregate, they were very relevant.  AR, Tab 3, \nTEB Report at 15- 16.  The evaluators reviewed the assessments received from a point \nof contact for each relevant contract along with past performance database ratings.  Those reports were uniformly positive for Kratos and thus provided a high degree of confidence that Kratos would perform successfully.  The agency consequently assigned \nthe quotation a rating of substantial confidence.  Id. at 17.  \n For Salient, the evaluators found one of its three past performance references was very relevant, while two were somewhat relevant.  Id.  at 30- 31.  Of those, the very relevant \ncontract was the incumbent task order, which the evaluators described as being performed by \u201c[t]he quoter . . . as the prime contractor .\u201d  Id. at 29.  When considered i n \naggregate, the evaluators viewed Salient \u2019s past performance as very relevant.  Id.  at 31.  \nThe record of past performance on the contracts identified in Salient \u2019s quotation was \nuniformly positive, and gave the evaluators a high degree of confidence that Salient would perform successfully and thus the agency assigned a rating of substantial \nconfidence.  Id.  at 33.  \n The resulting adjectival ratings and evaluated costs  were as follows : \n \n SALIENT  KRATOS  \nPERFORMANCE APPROACH  OUTSTANDING  ACCEPTABLE  \nPAST PERFORMANCE  SUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE  SUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE  \nEVALUATED COST  $156,908,158.44  $145,320,893.56  \n AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 30.    \nThe contracting officer, who served as the source selection authority, reviewed and agreed with the evaluation report.  The contracting officer summarized the strengths in both firms \u2019 quotations, as well as the two weaknesses in Kratos \u2019s quotation under the \nperformance approach factor and summarized the basis for both firm \u2019s past \nperformance ratings.  AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 10- 12.  The \ncontracting officer then made a comparative analysis  of the benefits of Salient \u2019s  Page 5    B-423376 et al.   approach and contrasted them with the evaluation of Kratos \u2019s quotation as generally \nadequate and providing strengths that were offset by its weaknesses.  Id. at 30-31.  The \ncontracting officer then summarized the past performance of both and concluded that \nboth firms merited a rating of substantial confidence.  Id.  at 32- 33.   \n Finally,  the contracting officer set out the source selection judgment that Salient \u2019s \nquotation demonstrated significant superiority over Kratos \u2019s under the performance \napproach factor, and a slight advantage under the past performance factor because its \nlonger period of very relevant performance.  Id. at 33.  The contracting officer explained \nthat Salient \u2019s advantage justified incurring the 8 percent higher evaluated cost, and \ntherefore Salient \u2019s quotation represented the best value for the government , particularly \nin view of the importance of the work to the security cooperation between the Navy and RSNF .  Id. at 34.  After receiving notice of the source selection and a brief explanation \nof the selection decision, Kratos filed this protest.\n5   \nDISCUSSION  Kratos challenges the evaluation of both firms \u2019 quotations under the performance \napproach and past performance factors as unreasonable, argues that the Navy \ndisparately  evaluat ed quotations , and contends that the source selection tradeoff \ndecision was unreasonable.  We consider the protester \u2019s arguments in turn and find that \nthe record does not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   \n \nPerformance Approach Evaluation  \n \nKratos argues that its quotation was misevaluated under the performance approach \nfactor by the assessment of the two weaknesses and by the Navy \u2019s failure to recognize \nadditional strengths in its proposed approach.  T he firm also argues that the evaluation \nreflects disparate treatment because the Navy assessed strengths for aspects of \nSalient \u2019s approach that both quotations had in common but failed to assess Kratos \u2019s \nquotation similarly.   \n \nWhere a protester challenges an agency \u2019s evaluation of quotations  in a task or delivery \norder competition under FAR subpart 16.5, our Office does not reevaluate quotations; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the evaluation criteria and the applicable procurement laws and \nregulations.

Page 6    B-423376 et al.   Evaluation of Weaknesses  \n \nKratos argues that the Navy misevaluated its  quotation by assessing a  weakness for \nposing a risk that Kratos would commit to work beyond the task order scope or agree to \nunauthorized commitments .  Protest at 8 -9.  In this regard, under the evaluation for \nPWS section 1.1.2, which addressed the vendor \u2019s management  of its teams ( often \nreferred to in the record simply as program management) , the Navy assessed a \nweakness because Kratos \u2019s quotation described having the firm \u2019s managers \ncommunicate with RSNF  personnel to determine program requirements .  By proposing \ncontact directly with RSNF  and without involv ement of NETSAFA  to establish those \nrequirements , the evaluators found Kratos \u2019s approach posed  a risk of the firm \nperforming requirements that exceed those required by the task order .  AR, Tab 3, TEB \nReport at 7.  The agency  deemed that aspect of the quotation a risk that constituted a \nweakness in the firm\u2019s approach.   Id.  \n Kratos contends that the assessment of this weakness was unreasonable because the Navy  misread the approach described in the firm \u2019s quotation.  Protest at 8.  Kratos \nargues that when the quotation indicated direct contact with RSNF, the broader approach the firm proposed placed communication with the Navy first, and never \nindicated that the firm would fail to involve the Navy or that the firm would take direction \nfrom RSNF.  Id.  Instead, Kratos emphasizes that its quotation stated that the firm would \n[DELETED ].\u201d  Id. (quoting Kratos Quotation vol. I at 4\n6).  Further , Kratos argues that its \nquotation \u201c[DELETED] ,\u201d thereby committing to replicate its \u201c successful communication \nplan . . . during [its] last contract, \u201d7 whereas the evaluation was based only on an out -of-\ncontext reading of one sentence.  Id. at 6; Comments & Supp. Protest at 6 ; Second \nSupp. Comments at 2 .   \nThe Navy responds that the evaluation of this  weakness was based on the description \nof the firm\u2019 s approach in its quotation and was reasonable.  In particular, t he agency \nnotes that the approach stated that Kratos \u2019s approach was to have its functional \nmanagers communicat e with RSNF about requirements and then, only afterward , seek  \nfinal approval from NETSAFA.  Contrary to Kratos \u2019s assertion that the evaluators \nmisread the quotation, the agency argues that the \u201c non-cost\/technical quote, made no \nmention of NETSAFA \u2019s involvement in its planned communications with RSNF \nleadership. \u201d  Contracting Officer \u2019s Statement  and Memorandum of Law ( COS\/ MOL ) \nat 18.  Therefore, the agency contends, it was reasonable for  the e valuators to conclude \nthat Kratos \u2019s approach would risk leaving NETSAFA out of a discussion with RSNF \nleadership, which posed the risk of making commitments to RSNF that expanded the \nscope of work , made unauthorized commitments, or disrupted the chain of command.   \nAR, Tab 8, Decl. of Technical Evaluation Board Chair at 7.

Second Supp. MOL at  7.   \n \nThe record reasonably supports the Navy \u2019s evaluation.

Among them was that the firm\u2019 s functional managers would \n\u201c[DELETED] \u201d  Kratos Quotation vol. I at 3.  NETSAFA is not mentioned in this sentence.  \nThe quotation stated the firm would then [ DELETED] .\u201d  Id. at 4.  The Navy \u2019s conclusion \nthat Kratos \u2019s approach posed a risk of developing a work plan that included \ncommitments that NETSAFA had not authorized, work that was outside the scope of the contract, and disruption in the relationship between the Navy and RSNF was reasonable and based on the content of Kratos \u2019s quotation.   As noted above, Kratos \nhad the responsibility to submit a clear and well -written quotation.  Manutek Inc. , supra.   \nThe record thus supports the Navy \u2019s evaluation judgment in assessing a weakness in \nKratos \u2019s quotation.\n8  While the evaluation characterized the weakness as being offset \nby the firm \u2019s general emphasis on open communication with NETSAFA, the net effect \nstill contributed to the overall assessment of Kratos \u2019s quotation as acceptable under the \nperformance approach factor.  COS\/ MOL at 17.  Consequently, the evaluators and, \nsubsequently, the contracting officer , properly consider ed the weakness in their overall \nassessment of the merit of Kratos \u2019s quotation under the performance approach factor.   \n Kratos next argues that the assessment of the second weakness under the \nperformance approach factor was unreasonable.  As noted above, the TEB assessed a weakness based on the quotation describing the use of Kratos \u2019s proprietary software in \n \n8 Kratos also argues that the evaluation reflects disparate treatment because Salient \u2019s \nquotation was not assessed a weakness even though it also allegedly proposed communication with RSNF that did not include NETSAFA , and because Kratos \u2019s \nquotation was not assessed a strength, as Salient \u2019s was, for its substantively \nindistinguishable communications plan.  Second Supp. Protest at 3-5.  Where a \nprotester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the offerors \u2019 proposals  (or \nquotations) .  Paragon Sys., Inc.; S ecTek, Inc. , B-409066.2, B -409066.3, June 4, 2014, \n2014 CPD \u00b6 169 at 8- 9.   \nThe record supports the Navy \u2019s explanation that even though each quotation had \u201c a \nsimilar overall concept of coordinated and frequent communication, \u201d Salient \u2019s was more \ndetailed and beneficial.  Second Supp. Decl. of TEB Chair at 3.  For example, Salient \u2019s \napproach clearly emphasized its use of steady informal communication to keep \nNETSAFA updated about its operations, while Kratos \u2019s relied on standard formal \nupdates to the agency.  Id.  Given what the Navy  notes is added complexity of operating \nacross geographically dispersed sites  and interacting with RSNF, the agency explains \nthat it viewed Salient \u2019s approach as providing better visibility into the contractor \u2019s \nperformance that provided an important advantage over Kratos \u2019s formal communication \nstructure.  Id.  Given the differences in the approaches, Kratos has not shown that the \nevaluation reflected disparate treatment.    Page 8    B-423376 et al.   support of the curriculum management requirements , which were required under \nsections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 of the PWS .  The evaluators deemed the approach a \nweakness because it would foster reliance on Kratos \u2019s proprietary software systems \nthat would then complicate efforts to recompete the requirement .  Kratos argues that the \nNavy again misread the firm \u2019s quotation, which it argues only described the planned use \nof its proprietary software as part of an effort that supports [ DELETED] , separate from \nthe perf ormance of the contract at issue.  Protest at 9- 12; Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 8-9.   \n \nKratos argues  that its quotation only mentioned the proprietary software to explain the \nfirm\u2019s involvement with [ DELETED]  as a basis to recommend that NETSAFA work with \n[DELETED ] to gain the benefit of its training opportunities and access to its [DELETED] .  \nKratos argues that its quotation did not propose to implement its proprietary software in the performance of the task order at issue, so assessing a weakness for that approach \nwas baseless and thus unreasonable.  Id.   Further, Kratos argues that even if the Navy \nwas reasonable to read the quotation as proposing the use of the proprietary software on the task order at issue, it was still unreasonable to assess a weakness because Kratos was at most recommending that  the agency use its proprietary software, and that \nNETSAFA could simpl y decline to adopt that recommendation.  Comments & Supp. \nProtest at  6.   \n The Navy argues that its evaluation was reasonable.  The agency contends  that the \nlanguage of Kratos \u2019s quotation specifically recommends the use of its [ DELETED]  \nproprietary software in its performance approach narrative responding to PWS sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3.  COS\/ MOL at 19.   That is, the firm did not simply mention its \nproprietary software, but specifically recommended its use as its performance approach under the curriculum management tasks.  Id.  The agency contends that its reading of \nthe quotation was reasonable, and its concern about adopting Kratos \u2019s proposed \napproach to curriculum management as effectively locking in Kratos ( through \ninstitutionalizing the use of its proprietary software)  is reasonable and supports the \nassessment of the weakness .  Id. at 20 (citing AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at 7 -8). \n Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evalua tion.

Here, the Navy  understood Kratos \u2019s approach to the  Page 9    B-423376 et al.   task order at issue as making a recommendation for aligning the curriculum \ndevelopment for RSNF with the resources and capabilities at [ DELETED] , which Kratos \ndescribed as including its proprietary software system  as key intellectual property .  \nKratos Quotation vol.

As a result, t he Navy  was reasonable in assessing a \nweakness based on an approach that recommended the use of Kratos \u2019s proprietary \nsoftware solution.9   \nFailure to Assign Strengths  \n Kratos next argues that the Navy misevaluated multiple aspects of its quotation that \nshould have resulted in the assessment of additional strengths  under the performance \napproach factor .   \n Where an evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria, the protester \u2019s assertion that its proposal  (or quotation, as here) should have been \nassessed additional strengths under a factor does not demonstrate an unreasonable evaluation;  rather, the protester \u2019s arguments simply constitute disagreement with the \nagency \u2019s evaluation judgments  that do not provide a basis to sustain the protest .  \nGeoNorth LLC , B-411473 et al. , Aug. 6, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 247 at 7.  As described \nbelow, the evaluation record documents careful review of the protester \u2019s proposed \napproach to the curriculum management and local employment plan requirements and considered judgment that the aspects that Kratos contends should have been additional strengths were not valuable to the Navy and thus did not merit additional strengths.  The protester \u2019s arguments to the contrary do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   \nKratos argues that its ongoing role as the RSNF training systems support contractor  \nuniquely allowed it to leverage the abilities of Kratos \u2019s subject matter experts who are \ninvolved in providing integration work for the Naval Tactical Team Trainer (NTTT)  and \nother new systems, and that Kratos could further provide the benefits of graphics and simulation content  created using the NTTT system if the Navy were to develop or \nupdate interactive media resources under the task order at issue.  Kratos argues that \nthe Navy unreasonabl y failed to assess an additional strength for proposing those \nbenefits.  Protest at 12- 13; Comments & Supp. Protest at 12 .  \n The Navy argues that the evaluation reasonably determined that Kratos \u2019s quotation did \nnot merit assessment of an additional strength with respect to Kratos \u2019s role as the \n \n9 Although Kratos contends that Salient likewise proposed to rely on proprietary \nsoftware solutions , for which it disparately received a strength,  the record does not \nsupport this contention.  The Navy counters that the strength assessed for Salient \u2019s \nsoftware systems, identified as \u201c[DELETED]\u201d and \u201c[DELETED] ,\u201d are both commercially \navailable programs sold by third parties, which therefore present  no similar risk of \nvendor lock -in because licenses to both systems could be transferred to,  or be acquired \nby, a successor contractor through ordinary commercial means .  Second Supp. Decl. of \nTEB Chair at  4-5.  The record thus does not provide a basis to find that the evaluation \ninvolved disparate treatment here.    Page 10    B-423376 et al.   RSNF training systems support contractor .  Regarding the firm\u2019 s proposed approach of \nleveraging that effort to provide expertise, graphics, and simulations, the agency \ncounters that the evaluators reasonabl y found the requirements of this task order would \nnot benefit from the types of expertise, or the graphics and simulations , that are  \nproduced by NTTT or other systems  under the training systems support work .  Further , \nthe agency notes that even if there were potential crossover benefits from the RSNF \ntraining systems support contract, the advantages  would once again raise risks of \ncreating dependencies to Kratos proprietary software systems , and NTTT specifically , \nso the risk of vendor lock -in would have been a weakness rather than a strength.  \nCOS\/ MOL at 21.   \n Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation \njudgment.  The record shows that the evaluators  specifically considered the firm \u2019s ability \nto leverage ownership of the NTTT software, and made a judgment that it was not considered a benefit at least in part because the scope of the task order at issue did not \ninclude use of simulation training.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.  Kratos supports its \nclaim that the ownership of the NTTT software would benefit the Navy by arguing that it \nwould make the firm \u2019s efforts more efficient, such as if Kratos were to prepare \ninteractive multimedia under PWS sections 2.1.1.6 or 2.1.4.  Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 10.  Kratos \u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the evaluation under the RFQ \ncriteria was unreasonable, however,  particularly because those PWS tasks were not \namong the five that the RFQ identified as being evaluated under the performance approach factor.  See RFQ at  46.  Rather, the record supports the reasonableness of \nthe agency \u2019s judgment because the evaluators considered the potential benefit of \nKratos \u2019s software and found the NTTT software (including its ownership by Kratos ) \nwould not provide significant value to the agency under the evaluation criteria for this \ntask order.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.   \n Kratos also argues that its quotation should also have been assessed a strength under \nthe evaluation element for section 5 of the PWS,  regarding a plan to meet local \nrequirements to employ Saudi nationals , because the firm had platinum status in the \nNitaqat Mutawar program , which requires employment of Saudi nationals .  Kratos \nargues that its rating exceeded the RFQ requirement that the vendor had to maintain a minimum of a \u201c [m]edium [g]reen\u201d  rating.  P rotest at 13.  The firm argues that the Navy \nunreasonably overlooked a significant benefit of  its higher platinum rating because \nattaining it made it less likely that through loss of qualifying employees, Kratos would be \ndowngraded below medium green.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at 10- 11.  The firm  \nalso argues that the Navy improperly treated the requirement as pass\/fail, rather than \nrecognizing the advantage of Kratos \u2019s platinum status under the program, which would \nhave justified the assessment of a strength based on the lower risk that Kratos would be downgraded below the PWS requirement of medium green.  Id.  at 10.    \n The Navy argues that the evaluation was reasonable because the RFQ required an \napproach to maint ain a minimum rating of \u201c[m]edium [g]reen\u201d  and comply with the social \ninsurance program.  The agency contends that whether a vendor \u2019s approach ensured \nthe firm would attain a medium green rating,  or would attain a higher rating,  the  Page 11    B-423376 et al.   approach provided equal value because platinum status provided no additional benefits  \nto the Navy.  AR, Tab 8, Decl. of TEB Chair at 9; COS\/ MOL at 22.  T he Navy also \nargues that the evaluators properly considered Kratos \u2019s four-element plan regarding \nPWS section 5, of which one element was for the firm to exceed only slightly the \nminimum local employment required to maintain medium green status for the task order \nat issue (i.e., the firm clarified that it would achieve a Saudization rate of [DELETED] \npercent on the task order, thereby exceeding the medium green requirement of \n38.81 percent).  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 12.  The Navy  also considered other \nelements of the firm\u2019 s approach that addressed successful recruiting and monitoring of \nemployment and payroll compliance.  Id.  at 12-13.  In considering the plan as a whole, \nthe evaluators reasonably deemed it adequate based on the firm \u2019s focus on candidate \nrecruitment and monitoring compliance.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 13.   \n Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation here.  \nKratos \u2019s quotation states that the firm \u201ccurrently hold[s] Platinum status \u201d in the Nitaqat \nMutawar program, and then describes its proposed approach to the requirements of \nsection 5 of the PWS as including a goal to maintain sufficient qualifying employees to \nattain medium green status.  Kratos Quotation vol. I at  10.  The Navy has explained why \nplatinum status did not afford any additional benefit to the agency and, in our view, the evaluators reasonably  determined that a strength was not justified.    \n Even if the Navy improperly assess ed vendors \u2019 Nitaqat Mutawar program status b y \ntreating the offerors \u2019 proposed approaches  as a pass\/fail evaluation, the record shows \nthat Kratos was not prejudiced by that  evaluation.   Our Office will not sustain a protest \nunless the protester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the \nagency \u2019s actions, that is, unless the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency \u2019s \nactions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  McDon ald-Bradley , B-270126, Feb. 8, 1996, 96- 1 CPD \u00b6 54 at 3.   The record does not \nsupport Kratos \u2019s claim that its quotation exceeded the minimum standard in the RFQ ; \nrather, while it presently has platinum status, its proposed approach is to attain medium green status .  As a result, even if the agency had rated vendors higher for proposing an \napproach that surpassed the requirement to maintain medium green status, Kratos has not shown that its approach did so and could reasonably have been rated higher than acceptable.   The protester has thus failed to show that the Navy evaluation was \nunreasonable when it assessed Kratos \u2019s proposed approach, which set a goal of \nqualifying for medium green status under the task order at issue.  The record does not show that Kratos \u2019s approach provided additional value to the agency.   \n Past Performance Evaluation  \n Kratos challenges the evaluation of Salient \u2019s past performance, arguing that the Navy \nimproperly credited Salient with the past performance of its affiliates , specifically past \nperformance by Salient \u2019s corporate parent and by the incumbent contractor , Salient \nFederal SGIS, which is Salient \u2019s subsidiary.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  Kratos \nargues that the record does not reflect any recognition by the Navy that the past  Page 12    B-423376 et al.   performance was for affiliated companies or that it was properly considered in \nassessing Salient \u2019s past performance.  Id.   \n \nThe Navy responds that the past performance evaluation was reasonable and properly considered the past performance of Salient \u2019s affiliates because the agency understood \nthat Salient was fully involved in performance of the incumbent contract, and the \nquotation described specific resources that Salient would use to perform as being the \nsame that were performing the incumbent contract.  Supp. COS at 2.   The agency also \nargues  that Salient and its affiliates are operationally united, and the resources of both \naffiliates were committed to performance of the task order at issue here.  Supp. MOL at 10-11.  The TEB chair confirms that even though the past performance evaluation \nrecord did not expressly explain the circumstances , the panel was aware that Salient \u2019s \naffiliate was the awardee of the incumbent contract, and that Salient \u2019s quotation \nreflected continued use of the incumbent \u2019s resources, including Salient committing  to \ncontinue all incumbent employees at their current salaries .  More generally , the \nevaluators were aware that Salient and its corporate affiliates (its parent and its subsidiary) were closely aligned through shared personnel and resources  and were \neffectively performing as one entity under the umbrella of Salient \u2019s parent .  Supp. AR, \nSecond Decl. of TEB Chair at 2- 3; Supp. COS at  2-4.  The Navy argues that the \nagency\u2019s past performance evaluation properly considered performance of the affiliates \nin evaluating Salient under the past performance factor based on the recognition of the close connection between the affiliated entities.   \nThe evaluation of past performance is a matter of discretion which our Office will not \ndisturb unless the agency \u2019s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the \nsolicitation criteria .  In a protest  challenging the evaluation of past performance, our \nOffice will review the record to determine if the evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the solicitation \u2019s evaluation criteria and procurement law and \nregulations .

An agency properly may attribute the past performance of a parent or \naffiliated company to an offeror where the firm \u2019s proposal (or quotation) demonstrates \nthat the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  \nPeraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 92 at 14.   \n \nOur review of the record shows that  the Navy justifi ed including in the evaluation of \nSalient \u2019s past performance contracts awarded to its parent and its subsidiary  because \nthe agency reasonably viewed the three firms as operationally united and identified \nresources of the incumbent that were committed to performance of the task order at issue .  The agency recognized a significant connection through three elements \nidentified in the quotation:  continued use of a training facility from the incumbent contract , a facility it had established in Saudi Arabia, and a corporate leadership cell .  \nSalient Quotation vol. I at 3- 4.  The quotation also described Salient as successfully \nperforming the incumbent contract and portrayed the three firms as operationally \nunified.  Id.  at 3.  The quotation named the key incumbent leadership personnel as \ncontinuing in their respective positions and explained its staffing for other positions as retaining many named incumbent employees , who would keep their employment \ncertification status and current salaries  for the base year of the task order at issue.  Id.   Page 13    B-423376 et al.   at 4; Salient Cost Quotation at 8- 9.  Finally, Salient and its affiliates share the same \ncorporate address and are listed as being affiliated in their SAM.gov records.  Supp. \nMOL at 2.   \n The TEB chair reasonably explains that the evaluators recognized  the description in the \nquotation as consistent with the firms \u2019 unified management under the umbrella of the \nparent company , and that the quotation indicated that the unified resources of the firms \nwould perform the task order at issue.   Supp. AR , Second Decl. of TEB Chair at 1, 3.   In \nour view, the circumstances provide a sufficient basis for the Navy evaluators to consider the performance of both Salient \u2019s parent and its subsidiary in the pas t \nperformance evaluation.   \n Best-Value Tradeoff  \n Finally, Kratos challenges the Navy \u2019s tradeoff rationale in selecting Salient \u2019s higher -\nrated and higher -priced quotation for award.

In its \ninitial protest and comments, Kratos contended that the source selection rationale relie d \nimproperly on adjectival ratings and the number of strengths and weaknesses assessed in the evaluation, rather than on the underlying merits of the quotations, to justify incurring $11.6 million of additional evaluated costs in selecting Salient \u2019s quotation.  Id.  \nat 12 n.4.   \n However, after Kratos filed its comments, the Navy submitted additional relevant documents, which included an unredacted copy of its business clearance memorandum , and those provided previously -redacted portions of the contracting \nofficer \u2019s source selection rationale.  In response, Kratos re focused its challenge to the \nbest-value tradeoff:  In its second supplemental comments, Kratos argues that the \nsource selection decision was flawed because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable evaluation and unequal treatment of both quotations.  A s explained \nabove, our review of the record shows that the Navy \u2019s evaluations under the \nperformance approach and past performance factors were  reasonable and that the \nallegedly unequal evaluation was justified by material differences in the quotations.   In \nsum, the allegation lacks a factual basis because the evaluation it was based on was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Accordingly, Kratos\u2019s challenge to the \nbest-value tradeoff is denied.   \n The protest is denied.    Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

Kratos contends that the Navy misevaluated quotations  and made an \nunreasonable source selection decision.   \n We deny the protest.   \n BACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the RFQ on July 25, 2024, to firms holding the Navy\u2019s SeaPort Next \nGeneration multiple- award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts , and \ndesignated the procurement a fair opportunity competition pursuant to Federal DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2    B-423376 et al.   Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 16.505(b).  Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFQ  \namend. 3 at 5.1  The RFQ  contemplated the issuance of a cost -plus-fixed -fee task order \nfor a base year  and four option years, plus an option for 15 days of demobilization \nservices to facilitate a transition to a successor contractor.  AR, Tab 1, RFQ at 52.   The \nRFQ incorporated a performance work statement (PWS) that described the scope of the \ntask order as assisting the N aval Education and Training Security Assistance Field \nActivity  (NETSAFA) by providing RSNF support services that would include training and \neducation, engineering, technical , and management support .  Id. at 16.  These services \nare to focus on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of directly supporting \u201c the \nRSNF \u2019s objective to remain the dominant Naval Force within the Middle East ,\u201d and are \nto include support for \u201call levels of in -Kingdom RSNF training and other logistical and \nadvisory support .\u201d  Id.   \n \nThe RFQ  provided for quotations2 to be evaluated under three factors .  The first, \nperformance approach, was more important than the second, past performance, and together those were more important than the third, cost.  RFQ at 51.  The successful \nvendor would be selected using a best value tradeoff among those factors.  Id.  \n For the performance approach factor, the RFQ instructed vendors to describe the firm \u2019s \napproach only under five specific PWS task elements , four of which are relevant here:  \n \n\u2022 PWS 1.1.2, which required the vendor to m anage teams of task order \nsupport personnel at multiple geographically dispersed locations.    \n\u2022 PWS 2.1.1.1, which required the vendor to \u201c [a]ssist the RSNF in the \nestablishment of a central Curriculum Management organization within the Learning Education Center in Riyadh with a focus on Learning Standards and Quality Control .\u201d \n\u2022 PWS 2.1.1.3, which required the vendor to \u201cperform annual analysis of \nthe state of the RSNF Curriculum Management process and provide results and recommendation of Short (12\/24 month) and Long (3-5 year) term goals ,\u201d and then deliver a report with the results .   \n\u2022 PWS 5, which required the vendor to offer a program \u201cto hire Saudi \nArabian Nationals  . . . in support of the new Saudi Arabian 2030 Vision \nPlan through performance of this requirement ,\u201d so that the vendor \nwould maintain  a \u201cminimum rating of \u2018 Medium Green\u2019  in the Saudi \n \n1 The solicitation was issued as a request for proposals but is referred to as an RFQ in \namendment 1.  Vendors \u2019 submissions are referred to as both quotations and proposals \nin the evaluation record and in the parties \u2019 protest filings.  For consistency, we refer to \nthe solicitation as an RFQ and to the vendors \u2019 submissions as quotations.  \n2 The Navy previously determined that three of seven interested firms were considered \nto be \u201c viable \u201d sources based on their experience, commitment, and eligibility to operate \nin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and invited those three to submit quotations.    Page 3    B-423376 et al.   Nitaqat Mutawar Program \u201d and meet the corresponding requirements \nof the national social insurance program.   \n \nRFQ at 16- 20, 46.   \nThe RFQ also expressly advised vendors that they could \u201c provide any other information \nconsidered relevant to the solicitation and PWS tasks .\u201d  Id. at 46.   \n Under the past performance factor, the RFQ directed vendors to submit three past performance references with the same or similar scope and magnitude that would be evaluated to assess \u201c how capable the [vendor] is of successfully accomplishing the \nrequirements of the solicitation. \u201d  Id. at 46- 47.  \n For the cost factor, which is not at issue here, the RFQ directed vendors to submit target costs and target fees using a web form, and documentation substantiating the \nrealism of the vendor \u2019s direct labor rates  and indirect rates .  Id. at 48 -49.  \n The three quotations the Navy received were from Salient\n3, Kratos , and a third firm that \nis not at issue here.  A technical evaluation board (TEB) reviewed the quotations , \nidentified strengths and weaknesses in each vendor \u2019s proposed approach under the \nperformance approach factor, and assessed adjectival ratings of outstanding, good, \nacceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  AR, Tab 4, TEB Memorandum4 at 5.  The TEB \nalso evaluated each vendor \u2019s past performance to assess first the relevance of each \nreference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant, and then all \nreferences together in aggregate.  The TEB then assess ed each vendor \u2019s record of \nperformance under its relevant contracts , which was expressed in terms of a level of \nconfidence in the vendor performing successfully .  The past performance evaluation \nresulted in adjectival ratings that included substantial confidence, satisfactory \nconfidence, and limited confidence.  Id. at 5-6.   \n \nThe Navy identified two weaknesses in the Kratos \u2019s approach under the performance \napproach factor.  The first weakness concerned Kratos \u2019s approach to managing teams \nof personnel under PWS section 1.1.2 that included having the firm \u2019s managers \ncommunicate with RSNF leadership about academic schedules and requirements \nwithout including NETSAFA.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  6-7.  The s econd weakness \nconcerned the firm\u2019 s approach to supporting curriculum management under PWS \nsections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 by proposi ng the use of Kratos \u2019s proprietary software, \nreferred to as [DELETED] , rather than commercial ly available software .  The TEB \nexplained that the use of proprietary software created a risk of vendor lock -in, a \nsituation where RSNF curriculum management would become reliant on the proprietary \n \n3 Salient is the corporate parent of the incumbent contractor , Salient Federal SGIS.    \n4 The TEB produced both a report document ing the evaluation judgments, and a \nmemorandum to the contracting officer, which described the evaluation process and summarized the results.

Although the TEB also identified strengths in Kratos \u2019s approach regarding the \nsame PWS requirements,  it determined the quotation merited an overall rating of \nacceptable under the performance approach factor.  Id.  at 12-13.   \nIn contrast, the TEB \u2019s evaluation of Salient \u2019s quotation found the firm \u2019s approach \nshowed exceptional understanding and demonstrated the ability to exceed program \nrequirements.  Id. at 19 -21.  The evaluation identified multiple strengths and no \nweaknesses, which the TEB determined merited an overall rating of outstanding under \nthe performance approach factor .  Id. at 29-30.  \n In evaluating Kratos under the past performance factor, the Navy determined that two of \nthe firm\u2019 s past performance examples were very relevant, and one was somewhat \nrelevant, and that  when considered in aggregate, they were very relevant.  AR, Tab 3, \nTEB Report at 15- 16.  The evaluators reviewed the assessments received from a point \nof contact for each relevant contract along with past performance database ratings.  Those reports were uniformly positive for Kratos and thus provided a high degree of confidence that Kratos would perform successfully.  The agency consequently assigned \nthe quotation a rating of substantial confidence.  Id. at 17.  \n For Salient, the evaluators found one of its three past performance references was very relevant, while two were somewhat relevant.  Id.  at 30- 31.  Of those, the very relevant \ncontract was the incumbent task order, which the evaluators described as being performed by \u201c[t]he quoter . . . as the prime contractor .\u201d  Id. at 29.  When considered i n \naggregate, the evaluators viewed Salient \u2019s past performance as very relevant.  Id.  at 31.  \nThe record of past performance on the contracts identified in Salient \u2019s quotation was \nuniformly positive, and gave the evaluators a high degree of confidence that Salient would perform successfully and thus the agency assigned a rating of substantial \nconfidence.  Id.  at 33.  \n The resulting adjectival ratings and evaluated costs  were as follows : \n \n SALIENT  KRATOS  \nPERFORMANCE APPROACH  OUTSTANDING  ACCEPTABLE  \nPAST PERFORMANCE  SUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE  SUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE  \nEVALUATED COST  $156,908,158.44  $145,320,893.56  \n AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 30.    \nThe contracting officer, who served as the source selection authority, reviewed and agreed with the evaluation report.  The contracting officer summarized the strengths in both firms \u2019 quotations, as well as the two weaknesses in Kratos \u2019s quotation under the \nperformance approach factor and summarized the basis for both firm \u2019s past \nperformance ratings.  AR, Tab 5, Business Clearance Memorandum at 10- 12.  The \ncontracting officer then made a comparative analysis  of the benefits of Salient \u2019s  Page 5    B-423376 et al.   approach and contrasted them with the evaluation of Kratos \u2019s quotation as generally \nadequate and providing strengths that were offset by its weaknesses.  Id. at 30-31.  The \ncontracting officer then summarized the past performance of both and concluded that \nboth firms merited a rating of substantial confidence.  Id.  at 32- 33.   \n Finally,  the contracting officer set out the source selection judgment that Salient \u2019s \nquotation demonstrated significant superiority over Kratos \u2019s under the performance \napproach factor, and a slight advantage under the past performance factor because its \nlonger period of very relevant performance.  Id. at 33.  The contracting officer explained \nthat Salient \u2019s advantage justified incurring the 8 percent higher evaluated cost, and \ntherefore Salient \u2019s quotation represented the best value for the government , particularly \nin view of the importance of the work to the security cooperation between the Navy and RSNF .  Id. at 34.  After receiving notice of the source selection and a brief explanation \nof the selection decision, Kratos filed this protest.\n5   \nDISCUSSION  Kratos challenges the evaluation of both firms \u2019 quotations under the performance \napproach and past performance factors as unreasonable, argues that the Navy \ndisparately  evaluat ed quotations , and contends that the source selection tradeoff \ndecision was unreasonable.  We consider the protester \u2019s arguments in turn and find that \nthe record does not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   \n \nPerformance Approach Evaluation  \n \nKratos argues that its quotation was misevaluated under the performance approach \nfactor by the assessment of the two weaknesses and by the Navy \u2019s failure to recognize \nadditional strengths in its proposed approach.  T he firm also argues that the evaluation \nreflects disparate treatment because the Navy assessed strengths for aspects of \nSalient \u2019s approach that both quotations had in common but failed to assess Kratos \u2019s \nquotation similarly.   \n \nWhere a protester challenges an agency \u2019s evaluation of quotations  in a task or delivery \norder competition under FAR subpart 16.5, our Office does not reevaluate quotations; rather, we review the record to determine whether the evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the evaluation criteria and the applicable procurement laws and \nregulations.  Wyle Labs., Inc. , B-416528.2, Jan. 11, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 19 at 4.  The \nevaluation of risk associated with specific aspects of  a vendor \u2019s proposed approach is \nproper even where risk may not have been specifically identified as an element of the \nevaluation.   Id. at 6.  Ultimately, a vendor  bears the obligation to submit a well -written \nquotation to clearly demonstrate its approach and its compliance with the solicitation \nrequirements.

Page 6    B-423376 et al.   Evaluation of Weaknesses  \n \nKratos argues that the Navy misevaluated its  quotation by assessing a  weakness for \nposing a risk that Kratos would commit to work beyond the task order scope or agree to \nunauthorized commitments .  Protest at 8 -9.  In this regard, under the evaluation for \nPWS section 1.1.2, which addressed the vendor \u2019s management  of its teams ( often \nreferred to in the record simply as program management) , the Navy assessed a \nweakness because Kratos \u2019s quotation described having the firm \u2019s managers \ncommunicate with RSNF  personnel to determine program requirements .  By proposing \ncontact directly with RSNF  and without involv ement of NETSAFA  to establish those \nrequirements , the evaluators found Kratos \u2019s approach posed  a risk of the firm \nperforming requirements that exceed those required by the task order .  AR, Tab 3, TEB \nReport at 7.  The agency  deemed that aspect of the quotation a risk that constituted a \nweakness in the firm\u2019s approach.   Id.  \n Kratos contends that the assessment of this weakness was unreasonable because the Navy  misread the approach described in the firm \u2019s quotation.  Protest at 8.  Kratos \nargues that when the quotation indicated direct contact with RSNF, the broader approach the firm proposed placed communication with the Navy first, and never \nindicated that the firm would fail to involve the Navy or that the firm would take direction \nfrom RSNF.  Id.  Instead, Kratos emphasizes that its quotation stated that the firm would \n[DELETED ].\u201d  Id. (quoting Kratos Quotation vol. I at 4\n6).  Further , Kratos argues that its \nquotation \u201c[DELETED] ,\u201d thereby committing to replicate its \u201c successful communication \nplan . . . during [its] last contract, \u201d7 whereas the evaluation was based only on an out -of-\ncontext reading of one sentence.  Id. at 6; Comments & Supp. Protest at 6 ; Second \nSupp. Comments at 2 .   \nThe Navy responds that the evaluation of this  weakness was based on the description \nof the firm\u2019 s approach in its quotation and was reasonable.  In particular, t he agency \nnotes that the approach stated that Kratos \u2019s approach was to have its functional \nmanagers communicat e with RSNF about requirements and then, only afterward , seek  \nfinal approval from NETSAFA.  Contrary to Kratos \u2019s assertion that the evaluators \nmisread the quotation, the agency argues that the \u201c non-cost\/technical quote, made no \nmention of NETSAFA \u2019s involvement in its planned communications with RSNF \nleadership. \u201d  Contracting Officer \u2019s Statement  and Memorandum of Law ( COS\/ MOL ) \nat 18.  Therefore, the agency contends, it was reasonable for  the e valuators to conclude \nthat Kratos \u2019s approach would risk leaving NETSAFA out of a discussion with RSNF \nleadership, which posed the risk of making commitments to RSNF that expanded the \nscope of work , made unauthorized commitments, or disrupted the chain of command.   \nAR, Tab 8, Decl. of Technical Evaluation Board Chair at 7.   To the extent that the \n \n6 Citation s to the vendors \u2019 quotations refer to documents filed as  Electronic Protest \nDocketing System No.  36 (agency response to additional documents request).   \n7 Kratos had been the incumbent contractor until 2021.    Page 7    B-423376 et al.   protester argues that its approach  was misunderstood, the agency counters that the \nlanguage of the quotation was at best unclear.  Second Supp. MOL at  7.   \n \nThe record reasonably supports the Navy \u2019s evaluation.  The Kratos quotation describes \nwhat the agency understood as distinct elements  because they were set forth in \nseparate sentences .  Among them was that the firm\u2019 s functional managers would \n\u201c[DELETED] \u201d  Kratos Quotation vol. I at 3.  NETSAFA is not mentioned in this sentence.  \nThe quotation stated the firm would then [ DELETED] .\u201d  Id. at 4.  The Navy \u2019s conclusion \nthat Kratos \u2019s approach posed a risk of developing a work plan that included \ncommitments that NETSAFA had not authorized, work that was outside the scope of the contract, and disruption in the relationship between the Navy and RSNF was reasonable and based on the content of Kratos \u2019s quotation.   As noted above, Kratos \nhad the responsibility to submit a clear and well -written quotation.  Manutek Inc. , supra.   \nThe record thus supports the Navy \u2019s evaluation judgment in assessing a weakness in \nKratos \u2019s quotation.\n8  While the evaluation characterized the weakness as being offset \nby the firm \u2019s general emphasis on open communication with NETSAFA, the net effect \nstill contributed to the overall assessment of Kratos \u2019s quotation as acceptable under the \nperformance approach factor.  COS\/ MOL at 17.  Consequently, the evaluators and, \nsubsequently, the contracting officer , properly consider ed the weakness in their overall \nassessment of the merit of Kratos \u2019s quotation under the performance approach factor.   \n Kratos next argues that the assessment of the second weakness under the \nperformance approach factor was unreasonable.  As noted above, the TEB assessed a weakness based on the quotation describing the use of Kratos \u2019s proprietary software in \n \n8 Kratos also argues that the evaluation reflects disparate treatment because Salient \u2019s \nquotation was not assessed a weakness even though it also allegedly proposed communication with RSNF that did not include NETSAFA , and because Kratos \u2019s \nquotation was not assessed a strength, as Salient \u2019s was, for its substantively \nindistinguishable communications plan.  Second Supp. Protest at 3-5.  Where a \nprotester alleges unequal treatment in a technical evaluation, it must show that the differences in ratings did not stem from differences between the offerors \u2019 proposals  (or \nquotations) .  Paragon Sys., Inc.; S ecTek, Inc. , B-409066.2, B -409066.3, June 4, 2014, \n2014 CPD \u00b6 169 at 8- 9.   \nThe record supports the Navy \u2019s explanation that even though each quotation had \u201c a \nsimilar overall concept of coordinated and frequent communication, \u201d Salient \u2019s was more \ndetailed and beneficial.  Second Supp. Decl. of TEB Chair at 3.  For example, Salient \u2019s \napproach clearly emphasized its use of steady informal communication to keep \nNETSAFA updated about its operations, while Kratos \u2019s relied on standard formal \nupdates to the agency.  Id.  Given what the Navy  notes is added complexity of operating \nacross geographically dispersed sites  and interacting with RSNF, the agency explains \nthat it viewed Salient \u2019s approach as providing better visibility into the contractor \u2019s \nperformance that provided an important advantage over Kratos \u2019s formal communication \nstructure.  Id.  Given the differences in the approaches, Kratos has not shown that the \nevaluation reflected disparate treatment.    Page 8    B-423376 et al.   support of the curriculum management requirements , which were required under \nsections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3 of the PWS .  The evaluators deemed the approach a \nweakness because it would foster reliance on Kratos \u2019s proprietary software systems \nthat would then complicate efforts to recompete the requirement .  Kratos argues that the \nNavy again misread the firm \u2019s quotation, which it argues only described the planned use \nof its proprietary software as part of an effort that supports [ DELETED] , separate from \nthe perf ormance of the contract at issue.  Protest at 9- 12; Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 8-9.   \n \nKratos argues  that its quotation only mentioned the proprietary software to explain the \nfirm\u2019s involvement with [ DELETED]  as a basis to recommend that NETSAFA work with \n[DELETED ] to gain the benefit of its training opportunities and access to its [DELETED] .  \nKratos argues that its quotation did not propose to implement its proprietary software in the performance of the task order at issue, so assessing a weakness for that approach \nwas baseless and thus unreasonable.  Id.   Further, Kratos argues that even if the Navy \nwas reasonable to read the quotation as proposing the use of the proprietary software on the task order at issue, it was still unreasonable to assess a weakness because Kratos was at most recommending that  the agency use its proprietary software, and that \nNETSAFA could simpl y decline to adopt that recommendation.  Comments & Supp. \nProtest at  6.   \n The Navy argues that its evaluation was reasonable.  The agency contends  that the \nlanguage of Kratos \u2019s quotation specifically recommends the use of its [ DELETED]  \nproprietary software in its performance approach narrative responding to PWS sections 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.3.  COS\/ MOL at 19.   That is, the firm did not simply mention its \nproprietary software, but specifically recommended its use as its performance approach under the curriculum management tasks.  Id.  The agency contends that its reading of \nthe quotation was reasonable, and its concern about adopting Kratos \u2019s proposed \napproach to curriculum management as effectively locking in Kratos ( through \ninstitutionalizing the use of its proprietary software)  is reasonable and supports the \nassessment of the weakness .  Id. at 20 (citing AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at 7 -8). \n Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evalua tion.  In its \nquotation, the passage at issue appears  to state that Kratos \u2019s approach to the task \norder at issue involves the use of its propriet ary software:   \n \n[DELETED ]. \n Kratos Quotation vol.

Here, the Navy  understood Kratos \u2019s approach to the  Page 9    B-423376 et al.   task order at issue as making a recommendation for aligning the curriculum \ndevelopment for RSNF with the resources and capabilities at [ DELETED] , which Kratos \ndescribed as including its proprietary software system  as key intellectual property .  \nKratos Quotation vol.

As a result, t he Navy  was reasonable in assessing a \nweakness based on an approach that recommended the use of Kratos \u2019s proprietary \nsoftware solution.9   \nFailure to Assign Strengths  \n Kratos next argues that the Navy misevaluated multiple aspects of its quotation that \nshould have resulted in the assessment of additional strengths  under the performance \napproach factor .   \n Where an evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria, the protester \u2019s assertion that its proposal  (or quotation, as here) should have been \nassessed additional strengths under a factor does not demonstrate an unreasonable evaluation;  rather, the protester \u2019s arguments simply constitute disagreement with the \nagency \u2019s evaluation judgments  that do not provide a basis to sustain the protest .  \nGeoNorth LLC , B-411473 et al. , Aug. 6, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 247 at 7.  As described \nbelow, the evaluation record documents careful review of the protester \u2019s proposed \napproach to the curriculum management and local employment plan requirements and considered judgment that the aspects that Kratos contends should have been additional strengths were not valuable to the Navy and thus did not merit additional strengths.  The protester \u2019s arguments to the contrary do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.   \nKratos argues that its ongoing role as the RSNF training systems support contractor  \nuniquely allowed it to leverage the abilities of Kratos \u2019s subject matter experts who are \ninvolved in providing integration work for the Naval Tactical Team Trainer (NTTT)  and \nother new systems, and that Kratos could further provide the benefits of graphics and simulation content  created using the NTTT system if the Navy were to develop or \nupdate interactive media resources under the task order at issue.  Kratos argues that \nthe Navy unreasonabl y failed to assess an additional strength for proposing those \nbenefits.

The Navy counters that the strength assessed for Salient \u2019s \nsoftware systems, identified as \u201c[DELETED]\u201d and \u201c[DELETED] ,\u201d are both commercially \navailable programs sold by third parties, which therefore present  no similar risk of \nvendor lock -in because licenses to both systems could be transferred to,  or be acquired \nby, a successor contractor through ordinary commercial means .  Second Supp. Decl. of \nTEB Chair at  4-5.  The record thus does not provide a basis to find that the evaluation \ninvolved disparate treatment here.    Page 10    B-423376 et al.   RSNF training systems support contractor .  Regarding the firm\u2019 s proposed approach of \nleveraging that effort to provide expertise, graphics, and simulations, the agency \ncounters that the evaluators reasonabl y found the requirements of this task order would \nnot benefit from the types of expertise, or the graphics and simulations , that are  \nproduced by NTTT or other systems  under the training systems support work .  Further , \nthe agency notes that even if there were potential crossover benefits from the RSNF \ntraining systems support contract, the advantages  would once again raise risks of \ncreating dependencies to Kratos proprietary software systems , and NTTT specifically , \nso the risk of vendor lock -in would have been a weakness rather than a strength.  \nCOS\/ MOL at 21.   \n Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation \njudgment.  The record shows that the evaluators  specifically considered the firm \u2019s ability \nto leverage ownership of the NTTT software, and made a judgment that it was not considered a benefit at least in part because the scope of the task order at issue did not \ninclude use of simulation training.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.  Kratos supports its \nclaim that the ownership of the NTTT software would benefit the Navy by arguing that it \nwould make the firm \u2019s efforts more efficient, such as if Kratos were to prepare \ninteractive multimedia under PWS sections 2.1.1.6 or 2.1.4.  Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 10.  Kratos \u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the evaluation under the RFQ \ncriteria was unreasonable, however,  particularly because those PWS tasks were not \namong the five that the RFQ identified as being evaluated under the performance approach factor.  See RFQ at  46.  Rather, the record supports the reasonableness of \nthe agency \u2019s judgment because the evaluators considered the potential benefit of \nKratos \u2019s software and found the NTTT software (including its ownership by Kratos ) \nwould not provide significant value to the agency under the evaluation criteria for this \ntask order.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report at  12.   \n Kratos also argues that its quotation should also have been assessed a strength under \nthe evaluation element for section 5 of the PWS,  regarding a plan to meet local \nrequirements to employ Saudi nationals , because the firm had platinum status in the \nNitaqat Mutawar program , which requires employment of Saudi nationals .  Kratos \nargues that its rating exceeded the RFQ requirement that the vendor had to maintain a minimum of a \u201c [m]edium [g]reen\u201d  rating.  P rotest at 13.  The firm argues that the Navy \nunreasonably overlooked a significant benefit of  its higher platinum rating because \nattaining it made it less likely that through loss of qualifying employees, Kratos would be \ndowngraded below medium green.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at 10- 11.  The firm  \nalso argues that the Navy improperly treated the requirement as pass\/fail, rather than \nrecognizing the advantage of Kratos \u2019s platinum status under the program, which would \nhave justified the assessment of a strength based on the lower risk that Kratos would be downgraded below the PWS requirement of medium green.  Id.  at 10.    \n The Navy argues that the evaluation was reasonable because the RFQ required an \napproach to maint ain a minimum rating of \u201c[m]edium [g]reen\u201d  and comply with the social \ninsurance program.  The agency contends that whether a vendor \u2019s approach ensured \nthe firm would attain a medium green rating,  or would attain a higher rating,  the  Page 11    B-423376 et al.   approach provided equal value because platinum status provided no additional benefits  \nto the Navy.  AR, Tab 8, Decl. of TEB Chair at 9; COS\/ MOL at 22.  T he Navy also \nargues that the evaluators properly considered Kratos \u2019s four-element plan regarding \nPWS section 5, of which one element was for the firm to exceed only slightly the \nminimum local employment required to maintain medium green status for the task order \nat issue (i.e., the firm clarified that it would achieve a Saudization rate of [DELETED] \npercent on the task order, thereby exceeding the medium green requirement of \n38.81 percent).  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 12.  The Navy  also considered other \nelements of the firm\u2019 s approach that addressed successful recruiting and monitoring of \nemployment and payroll compliance.  Id.  at 12-13.  In considering the plan as a whole, \nthe evaluators reasonably deemed it adequate based on the firm \u2019s focus on candidate \nrecruitment and monitoring compliance.  AR, Tab 3, TEB Report  at 13.   \n Our review of the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation here.  \nKratos \u2019s quotation states that the firm \u201ccurrently hold[s] Platinum status \u201d in the Nitaqat \nMutawar program, and then describes its proposed approach to the requirements of \nsection 5 of the PWS as including a goal to maintain sufficient qualifying employees to \nattain medium green status.  Kratos Quotation vol. I at  10.  The Navy has explained why \nplatinum status did not afford any additional benefit to the agency and, in our view, the evaluators reasonably  determined that a strength was not justified.    \n Even if the Navy improperly assess ed vendors \u2019 Nitaqat Mutawar program status b y \ntreating the offerors \u2019 proposed approaches  as a pass\/fail evaluation, the record shows \nthat Kratos was not prejudiced by that  evaluation.   Our Office will not sustain a protest \nunless the protester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the \nagency \u2019s actions, that is, unless the protester demonstrates that, but for the agency \u2019s \nactions, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  McDon ald-Bradley , B-270126, Feb. 8, 1996, 96- 1 CPD \u00b6 54 at 3.   The record does not \nsupport Kratos \u2019s claim that its quotation exceeded the minimum standard in the RFQ ; \nrather, while it presently has platinum status, its proposed approach is to attain medium green status .  As a result, even if the agency had rated vendors higher for proposing an \napproach that surpassed the requirement to maintain medium green status, Kratos has not shown that its approach did so and could reasonably have been rated higher than acceptable.   The protester has thus failed to show that the Navy evaluation was \nunreasonable when it assessed Kratos \u2019s proposed approach, which set a goal of \nqualifying for medium green status under the task order at issue.  The record does not show that Kratos \u2019s approach provided additional value to the agency.   \n Past Performance Evaluation  \n Kratos challenges the evaluation of Salient \u2019s past performance, arguing that the Navy \nimproperly credited Salient with the past performance of its affiliates , specifically past \nperformance by Salient \u2019s corporate parent and by the incumbent contractor , Salient \nFederal SGIS, which is Salient \u2019s subsidiary.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 5- 6.  Kratos \nargues that the record does not reflect any recognition by the Navy that the past  Page 12    B-423376 et al.   performance was for affiliated companies or that it was properly considered in \nassessing Salient \u2019s past performance.  Id.   \n \nThe Navy responds that the past performance evaluation was reasonable and properly considered the past performance of Salient \u2019s affiliates because the agency understood \nthat Salient was fully involved in performance of the incumbent contract, and the \nquotation described specific resources that Salient would use to perform as being the \nsame that were performing the incumbent contract.  Supp. COS at 2.   The agency also \nargues  that Salient and its affiliates are operationally united, and the resources of both \naffiliates were committed to performance of the task order at issue here.  Supp. MOL at 10-11.  The TEB chair confirms that even though the past performance evaluation \nrecord did not expressly explain the circumstances , the panel was aware that Salient \u2019s \naffiliate was the awardee of the incumbent contract, and that Salient \u2019s quotation \nreflected continued use of the incumbent \u2019s resources, including Salient committing  to \ncontinue all incumbent employees at their current salaries .  More generally , the \nevaluators were aware that Salient and its corporate affiliates (its parent and its subsidiary) were closely aligned through shared personnel and resources  and were \neffectively performing as one entity under the umbrella of Salient \u2019s parent .  Supp. AR, \nSecond Decl. of TEB Chair at 2- 3; Supp. COS at  2-4.  The Navy argues that the \nagency\u2019s past performance evaluation properly considered performance of the affiliates \nin evaluating Salient under the past performance factor based on the recognition of the close connection between the affiliated entities.   \nThe evaluation of past performance is a matter of discretion which our Office will not \ndisturb unless the agency \u2019s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the \nsolicitation criteria .  In a protest  challenging the evaluation of past performance, our \nOffice will review the record to determine if the evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the solicitation \u2019s evaluation criteria and procurement law and \nregulations .  Computer Scis. Corp. , B-409386.2, B -409386.3, Jan. 8, 2015, 2015 CPD \n\u00b6 34 at 12.  An agency properly may attribute the past performance of a parent or \naffiliated company to an offeror where the firm \u2019s proposal (or quotation) demonstrates \nthat the resources of the parent or affiliate will affect the performance of the offeror.  \nPeraton, Inc. , B-421038.6 et al. , Apr.  12, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 92 at 14.   \n \nOur review of the record shows that  the Navy justifi ed including in the evaluation of \nSalient \u2019s past performance contracts awarded to its parent and its subsidiary  because \nthe agency reasonably viewed the three firms as operationally united and identified \nresources of the incumbent that were committed to performance of the task order at issue .  The agency recognized a significant connection through three elements \nidentified in the quotation:  continued use of a training facility from the incumbent contract , a facility it had established in Saudi Arabia, and a corporate leadership cell .  \nSalient Quotation vol. I at 3- 4.  The quotation also described Salient as successfully \nperforming the incumbent contract and portrayed the three firms as operationally \nunified.  Id.  at 3.  The quotation named the key incumbent leadership personnel as \ncontinuing in their respective positions and explained its staffing for other positions as retaining many named incumbent employees , who would keep their employment \ncertification status and current salaries  for the base year of the task order at issue.  Id.   Page 13    B-423376 et al.   at 4; Salient Cost Quotation at 8- 9.  Finally, Salient and its affiliates share the same \ncorporate address and are listed as being affiliated in their SAM.gov records.  Supp. \nMOL at 2.   \n The TEB chair reasonably explains that the evaluators recognized  the description in the \nquotation as consistent with the firms \u2019 unified management under the umbrella of the \nparent company , and that the quotation indicated that the unified resources of the firms \nwould perform the task order at issue.   Supp. AR , Second Decl. of TEB Chair at 1, 3.   In \nour view, the circumstances provide a sufficient basis for the Navy evaluators to consider the performance of both Salient \u2019s parent and its subsidiary in the pas t \nperformance evaluation.   \n Best-Value Tradeoff  \n Finally, Kratos challenges the Navy \u2019s tradeoff rationale in selecting Salient \u2019s higher -\nrated and higher -priced quotation for award.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 11.  In its \ninitial protest and comments, Kratos contended that the source selection rationale relie d \nimproperly on adjectival ratings and the number of strengths and weaknesses assessed in the evaluation, rather than on the underlying merits of the quotations, to justify incurring $11.6 million of additional evaluated costs in selecting Salient \u2019s quotation.  Id.  \nat 12 n.4.   \n However, after Kratos filed its comments, the Navy submitted additional relevant documents, which included an unredacted copy of its business clearance memorandum , and those provided previously -redacted portions of the contracting \nofficer \u2019s source selection rationale.  In response, Kratos re focused its challenge to the \nbest-value tradeoff:  In its second supplemental comments, Kratos argues that the \nsource selection decision was flawed because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable evaluation and unequal treatment of both quotations.  A s explained \nabove, our review of the record shows that the Navy \u2019s evaluations under the \nperformance approach and past performance factors were  reasonable and that the \nallegedly unequal evaluation was justified by material differences in the quotations.   In \nsum, the allegation lacks a factual basis because the evaluation it was based on was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation .  Accordingly, Kratos\u2019s challenge to the \nbest-value tradeoff is denied.   \n The protest is denied.    Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 hazardous substance spill response program  worldwide .  The incumbent contractor is a \njoint venture named Global PCCI JV, whose majority owner at 51 percent is the \nprotester , Owl, and the awardee, PCCI, is the minority owner  at 49 percent .  Owl \ncontends that the Navy misevaluated both firms \u2019 proposals and made an unreasonable \nsource selection decision.   \n \nWe sustain the protest  in part and deny it in part .   \n BACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the RFP on September 28, 2023, to obtain proposals to provide \nservices under an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract for five years, \nwith a maximum value of $315 million.   Agency Report ( AR), Tab 2 , Consolidated RFP \nat 1-3.  Offeror s were directed to price services on a cost -plus-award- fee basis for \noperational efforts, and on a cost -plus-fixed -fee basis for nonoperational efforts .  Id. \nat 2.  The RFP included a statement of work  (SOW) that described the general scope of \nthe contract as providing engineering and technical services to support the ESSM system, provide operational and nonoperational support to the Navy \u2019s oil and hazardous \nsubstance spill response program.  Additionally, the contractor would provide equipment operation, maintenance, and related support at remote sites for a range of operations.   \nId. at 15. \n The RFP instructed offerors to submit proposals in three volumes:  t echnical (volume I), \ncost\/price (volume II), and solicitation package (volume III) .  Id. at 72 .  The RFP \nanticipated the award of a single IDIQ contract to the offeror whose proposal was \nevaluated as offering the best value to the government .  The evaluation of proposals \nwould utilize three factors, listed in descending order of importance:  t echnical \ncapability , past performance, and c ost\/price.  Id. at 10 9.  When combined, t he technical \ncapability and past performance factors were significantly more important than cost\/price  in determining which proposal provided the best value; in other words , the \nRFP indicated that the source selection would be based on a tradeoff among the \ntechnical capability, past performance, and cost\/price factors .  Id.   \n Under the technical factor, t he RFP instructed offerors to address three elements in \ntheir technical proposals :  personnel; management\n1; and technical capability and \nexperience .  Id. at 74 -80.  Additionally, the RFP identified  a fourth technical element, a \nsample problem, and stated that it would be optional for the agency  to require .2  Id. \nat 80.  The evaluation of each element was described as follows:    \n \n1 In the record, the management element is also referred to as the management \napproach\/organization plan element .  E.g., AR, Tab 1, Contracting Officer \u2019s \nStatement  (COS) at  2.   \n2 Ultimately, after receiving proposals, the Navy  issue d a sample problem .  A challenge \nto the evaluation of PCCI\u2019s sample problem was among several issues that our Office \nindicated would likely be dismissed, but the protester subsequently withdrew  it.    Page 3   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The evaluation standard is:  \n\u2022 Element A:  Personnel .  The degree to which the proposal \ndemonstrates that the Offeror is capable of providing personnel \nwith the professional and technical skills to successfully perform the \nrequirements of the [statement of work] . \n\u2022 Element B:  Management .  The degree to which the proposal \ndemonstrates that the Offeror \u2019s management \napproach\/organization plan is adequate to accomplish program objectives and satisfy all aspects of the [statement of work] and ESSM mission requirements based on the ESSM Operations Guide.   \n\u2022 Element C:  Technical Capability and Experience.   The degree to \nwhich the proposal demonstrates that the Offeror has the \nnecessary technical capability and corporate experience related to \nstorage, maintenance and operation of ESSM -type facilities, \nequipment, and systems .  \n\u2022 Element D:  Sample Problem .  The degree to which the response to \nthe sample problem .  . . demonstrates the Offeror \u2019s understanding \nof the Government \u2019s requirements and the ability to adequately and \nrealistically solve a problem in a condensed period of time .   \n \nId. at 109- 110.   \n Within the technical capability evaluation,  proposals were to be evaluated under each of \nthe four elements  described above, but the RFP expressly stated the elements were not \nconsidered subfactors and would not be separately rated.   Id.  The RFP also listed \nsubject areas within elements that offerors were instructed to address ; for example, key \npersonnel resumes under the personnel element, and nine areas under the management approach\/organization plan element,  such as overall organizational \nstructure , staffing levels , and training .  Id. at 75- 79.  The RFP also stated that the \ntechnical capability evaluation would result in assessment of combined technical\/risk ratings using color and adjectival rating pairs:  blue\/outstanding, purple\/good, \ngreen\/acceptable, yellow\/marginal, or red\/unacceptable.   Id. at 110.   \n Under the past performance factor, the RFP indicated that the agency would evaluate the recency, relevance, and quality of the offeror \u2019s performance record.   Id. at 111.\n3  \nThe evaluation would then rate each performance reference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant.  Id.   Then, taking into account  the relevance of the \nreferences and the record of performance, the offeror \u2019s overall past performance would \nbe assessed a confidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, unknown (or neutral), limited, or no confidence.  Id.  at 112.  \n \n \n3 Where page numbering in a document differs from the electronic pagination in the \nAdobe PDF file submitted to our Office, we cite the PDF page numbering.    Page 4   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The cost\/price evaluation would be based on a total evaluated cost\/price, using cost \ninformation provided by the offeror, principally scheduled labor rates, indirect rates, and \nthe offeror \u2019s award fee\/fixed fee.  Id.   Additionally, the RFP directed offerors to complete \nan accompanying cost worksheet by providing standard and overtime labor rates, and percentages for the firm \u2019s proposed fringe benefit rate, overhead rate, and general and \nadministrative rate.  AR, Tab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2.  For scheduled labor r ates, the \nRFP explained that offerors were to propose burdened rates , excluding fee amounts, \nand therefore the Navy would \u201c only evaluate the proposed scheduled labor rates for \nreasonableness and material balance. \u201d  Id. at 113.  Additionally, the RFP incorporated \nFAR provision 52.222- 46, which provides for an assessment of the compensation of \nprofessional employees.  Id. at 90.   \n For indirect rates, the RFP specified different evaluation methods depending on whether the offeror proposed to cap its indirect rates:   \nIf the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost-realism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the \nproposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.  If proposed indirect rates are \nconsidered to be unrealistic, the Offeror \u2019s proposed rates will  be adjusted \nupward to determine the Government evaluated indirect rate.  No \ndownward adjustment will be made. . . .  \nIf the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate \nrepresents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic.  \n Id. at 113.   \n Finally, the RFP provided that for purposes of evaluation, the offeror \u2019s proposed award-\nfee and fixed- fee \u201cevaluated fee percentages will be equal to the proposed fee \npercentages. \u201d  Id.   \n \nAfter an initial evaluation, the Navy held discussions with both offerors and requested \nfinal proposal revisions.  The evaluation of final proposal revisions identified strengths and weaknesses in both firms \u2019 proposals  under the technical capability factor .  The \nagency then determined that in comparing the firms \u2019 evaluations, some strengths and \nweaknesses were offset by strengths or weaknesses of similar significance in the competing proposal, and thus were considered offsetting.  Other strengths and weaknesses were determined not to have offsetting aspects in the competitor \u2019s \nproposal, and thus provided aspects with which to discriminate between the two proposals.  AR, Tab 6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at 8- 16.  For \nthe past performance factor, the agency determined that both offerors had demonstrated performance records that were similar in relevance and quality, and that no aspect of the past performance evaluation provided a basis to distinguish between the com petitors.  Id. at 17.    Page 5   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 In addition to those discriminating strengths and weaknesses, the overall evaluation \nproduced the following ratings and total evaluated cost\/prices:   \n \n OWL  PCCI  \nTECHNICAL CAPABILITY  GOOD  OUTSTANDING  \nPAST PERFORMANCE  VERY RELEVANT\/ \nSUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE   VERY RELEVANT\/ \nSUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE   \nTOTAL EVALUATED \nCOST\/PRICE  $204 ,108,658  $214,357,758  \n AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 7, 24; AR, Tab 6 , \nSSAC Report at 4; AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 3.    \nThe SSAC advised that its review determined that PCCI \u2019s proposal was superior to an \nextent that justified paying its higher total evaluated cost\/price, which represented a cost premium of 5 percent.   AR, Tab 6, SSAC Report at 18 -19.  The source selection \nauthority ( SSA) then reviewed the evaluation and tradeoff recommendation and \nconcurred with them .  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  2.  The SSA then explained that based on \nindependent judgment, PCCI \u2019s proposal represented the best value considering its \nsuperior technical evaluation, and cost\/price premium of 5 percent.  Based on that judgment, the SSA selected PCCI for award.  Id.  at 3.  Following notice of the award \nand a debriefing, Owl filed this protest.   \n DISCUSSION  Owl challenges multiple aspects of the evaluation and source selection decision.   We \nfirst turn to the protester \u2019s argument that PCCI was not a responsible contractor, which \nwe dismiss as lacking a sufficient factual basis.  We next determine that Owl \u2019s challenge \nto the Navy \u2019s failure to perform an evaluation of the offerors \u2019 professional compensation \nis valid and we sustain the protest on that basis .  We then address the protester \u2019s \nremaining challenges to the evaluation of proposals, which we conclude are without \nmerit.    \n Challenge to Affirmative Responsibility Determination  \n Owl\u2019s protest contends that PCCI lacked the financial capacity to perform the contract, \nand that the Navy ignored information regarding that lack of financial capacity that should have caused the Navy to find the firm not responsible to perform the contract.  Protest at 66.  In this regard, Owl asserts that PCCI proposed to cap its indirect costs below their documented historical rates and contends that PCCI also lacks adequate sources of financing that it will need to perform.  Id.   In Owl \u2019s view, the circ umstances \nindicate that PCCI has less than a half million dollars in working capital, but its capped indirect costs put it at risk of financial losses that Owl argues could exceed $26 million.  Id.; see also Opp. to Req. for Dismissal at 9.  In sum, Owl argues, the lack of access to \ncapital to manage losses resulting from the firm \u2019s proposed indirect cost cap was  Page 6   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 material information that the Navy failed to adequately consider, which should have \nresulted in the Navy finding PCCI was not a responsible offeror to perform this contract.   \n The Navy argues that Owl \u2019s challenge to the affirmative responsibility determination of \nPCCI is not an aspect of responsibility that GAO reviews and should therefore be dismissed.  The RFP requirement that the contractor possess financial capability does not establish a specific objective standard that could constitute definitive responsibility criteria, the agency contends.  Req. for Dismissal at 7.  Further, the Navy argues that Owl has not identified a violation of law or regulation, or any information that would \u201crais[e] serious concerns  that . . . the contracting officer unreasonably failed to consider \navailable relevant information\u201d  regarding PCCI \u2019s responsibility.  Id . at 6.  Rather, the \nagency maintains that the record shows the contracting officer exercised reasonable business judgment in finding that PCCI was a responsible contractor.   \nOur Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. section 21.5(c), generally exclude from our \nreview, consideration of protests that challenge an affirmative responsibility determination, with limited exceptions.  Those exceptions include that our Office will consider  a protest alleging that specific objective standards of responsibility were not \nmet, and that an affirmative responsibility determination failed to adequately consider information that was known or reasonably should have been known that, by its nature, would be expected to have a strong bearing on whether the awardee should be found \nresponsible.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5(c); MVM, Inc ., B-421788. 3, B-421788. 4, Mar. 5, 2024, \n2024 CPD \u00b6 63 at 10.  Our decision in MVM  exemplifies the type of information that \nwould meet our standard, where publicly available information indicated that the awardee \u2019s affiliate had settled false claims under a contract with a federal agency.  Id.  \nThe information at issue here, in contrast, questions PCCI \u2019s need for and access to \nworking ca pital.  It does not rise to the level required by our regulations to support a \nchallenge to the Navy \u2019s responsibility determination.  Instead, Owl \u2019s allegations raise \nordinary issues of financial capacity for the Navy to resolve.  We therefore dismiss the challenge to the Navy \u2019s determination that PCCI is a responsible contractor.   \n Failure to Evaluate Professional Compensation \n \nOwl argues that the Navy failed to assess the realism of the offerors \u2019 professional \ncompensation as required by the RFP, which incorporated Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (FAR) provision 52.222-46.  Protest at  72-73.  That provision provides that \n\u201c[t]he professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact \nupon recruiting and retention,  its realism , and its consistency with a total plan for \ncompensation. \u201d  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) .   \n The RFP instructed offerors to provide cost information in the proposal cost\/price \nvolume, including worksheet L- 2.  While the RFP instructions identified a requirement to \nprovide scheduled labor rates, indirect costs, and fringe benefit costs , RFP at 113, it \nalso instructed that all cells colored yellow in the worksheet were to be completed, which included a breakdown of the offeror \u2019s rates by location and performance period \ninto fringe rates, overhead rates, and general and administrative rates.  Id. at 84; AR, \nTab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2 at 6.  Thus, while t he scheduled labor rates were to be  Page 7   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 proposed as fully burdened (exclusive of fee)  fixed hourly rates , offerors were required \nto provide the applicable indirect burden percentages.   \n \nThe analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46 requires the agency to conduct \u201c in effect, a \nprice realism evaluation regarding an offeror \u2019s proposed compensation, \u201d and the agency \nmust also \u201c compare the awardee\u2019 s proposed professional compensation to the \nincumbent \u2019s.\u201d  Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, Jul.  31, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 259 at 5.    \nThe Navy and PCCI argue that this ground of protest should be dismissed because the statement that the evaluation of scheduled labor rates would only  consider \nreasonableness and balance was an obvious indication that the agency would not \nevaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52. 222-46, notwithstanding \nthe inclusion of that provision in the RFP .

Additionally , the Navy argues that the RFP also did not provide for the \nagency to obtain information needed to perform a comparison between the awardee\u2019 s \nprofessional compensation and the incumbent \u2019s, thereby making it apparent on the face \nof the RFP that the Navy would not perform the second element of the analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Req. for Dismissal at 8 -9.  The Navy also argues that the \nRFP did not reference submission of a professional compensation plan in the proposal preparation instructions or evaluation criteria and did not request salary information or a \ndescription of fringe benefits provided to professional employees.  Id.  at 9.  Accordingly , \nthe agency argues , the RFP instructions \u201c directly contradic t[ed]\u201d the evaluation that \nwould have been required under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Id.  at 8.   \n \nWe disagree.\n4  The RFP statement limiting the evaluation of the scheduled labor rates \n(to an assessment of reasonableness and material balance) is not contradicted--directly or implicitly --by FAR provision 52.222- 46 since the evaluations consider different \ninformation.  Specifically, the scheduled labor rates are burdened rates  (what the \ncontractor will charge the government,  albeit without fee)  whereas the evaluation under \nFAR provision 52.222- 46 assesses professional employee compens ation, which \nincludes \u201csalaries and fringe benefits .\u201d  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a).  Further, although \nthe Navy contends that it was apparent to offerors that proposals would not include \nsufficient information to make an analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46, the Navy\u2019s \nposition is not supported by the record.  W orksheet L- 2 required offerors to provide the \nNavy the means to calculate both the offeror \u2019s direct labor rate-- what the offeror will pay \nan employee--and expressly required it to provide fringe benefit rate(s)--the cost of the \nemployee\u2019s benefits relative to their wages .  We therefore conclude that the R FP \nprovided that the Navy would evaluate professional compensation consistent with FAR provision 52.222- 46, and that the RFP also required offerors to provide at least some \nminimal amount of information necessary for  the Navy to perform an evaluation.  \n \n4 Although our Office indicated that dismissal of this ground of protest as untimely \nappeared appropriate, we indicated that view was not a final decision,  and the parties \ncould raise additional arguments pending resolution of the protest in th e decision.  \nNotice of GAO Ruling on Partial Dismissal Request at 2.    Page 8   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 We have explained that t he purpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 (titled  Evaluation of \nCompensation for Professional Employees ), is to evaluate whether an offeror will obtain \nand keep the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract \nperformance, and to evaluate whether it understands the nature of the work to be \nperformed.  In the context of a contract where labor is priced by fixed  hourly rates , our \nOffice has noted that this FAR provision anticipates an evaluation of whether the offeror \nunderstands the contract \u2019s requirements and has offered a compensation plan \nappropriate for those requirements , which requires assessing the offeror \u2019s proposed \nprofessional compensation.  The depth of the analysis is a matter of the procuring \nagency \u2019s judgment, and so, in reviewing a protest challenging the evaluation, we will \nassess whether the agency \u2019s evaluation was reasonabl e and consistent with the \nsolicitation.   Criterion Sys ., Inc., B-419749 et al. , July  21, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  261 at 6- 7.   \n Here, t he Navy failed to assess the information provided in the offerors \u2019 proposals \nregarding professional compensation; it made no assess ment  of the realism of either \nofferor \u2019s professional compensation or whether it was lower than the incumbent \u2019s \ncompensation of professionals.  Indeed, the agency emphatically asserts that there was \u201cno doubt that the Navy would not obtain the information needed to evaluate the \nproposals in accordance with FAR 52.222- 46 and would not in fact conduct the \nevaluation. \u201d  See  Navy Req. for Dismissal at 8.   In res ponse to a question posed by Owl \nduring its debriefing, the Navy stated that \u201cThe capability to recruit and\/or retain personnel at proposed scheduled labor rates was not a specific requirement under Factor 3.0 [the cost\/price factor]  and was therefore not evaluated for Volume II [the \ncost\/price  proposal].\u201d  Protest exhs. 21- 30, exh. 27, Responses to Owl Debriefing \nQuestions at 73 (Answer No. 12).\n5   \n The RFP included FAR provision 52.222- 46, which provided that the agency would \nassess professional compensation.  The RFP required offerors to provide sufficient information for the Navy to assess, at a minimum, the offeror \u2019s direct rate s and fringe \nbenefit rates.  Because the Navy failed to perform the analysis required by FAR provision 52.222- 46, we sustain this ground of protest.   \nTechnical Evaluation Challenges  \n \nTurning to the remaining allegations, Owl raises many challenges to the evaluation of \nboth firms \u2019 proposals .  Owl argues that the technical evaluation was unreasonable in \nmultiple respects within each element .  Broadly, Owl contends that the Navy failed to \nreasonably consider significant differences in the proposed approaches and the \nresulting performance risk of both offerors, the agency unreasonably undervalued Owl \u2019s \nretention of most incumbent staff , treated the offerors unequally , and it erroneously \nevaluated PCCI \u2019s experience based, at least in part, on misrepresentations .  The \n \n5 Since, as noted above, the depth of the evaluation is principally a matter for the \nagency to determine, the fact that the agency did not request or obtain detailed \ncompensation plans from either offeror does not mitigate the failure to evaluate the inform ation that was submitted.    Page 9   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 protester also challenges the past performance evaluation as unreasonable and \ncontends that the cost evaluation failed to assess the risk posed by PCCI \u2019s indirect cost \nrate caps .  We have reviewed all of Owl \u2019s additional arguments and conclude that none, \nwith the exception of the agency\u2019s failure to evaluate professional compensation discussed above, provides a basis to sustain the protest .  We discuss only the most \nsignificant allegations below.   \n Under element A, personnel, the protester argues that the Navy unreasonably failed to \nrecognize that Owl \u2019s proposed approach provided significant advantages over PCCI \u2019s, \nand that the agency unreasonably discounted those advantages and mischaracterized \nOwl as having only a slight advantage.  Protest at 50- 51.  T he protester contends that \nits proposal provided significant unique value because it would retain [DELETED]  the \nincumbent key personnel ( [DELETED]  of 22 positions , of which nearly all made \nexclusive commitments to Owl ) and would also retain [ DELETED]  of the non- key \npersonnel , while  PCCI \u2019s proposal  did not provide that the firm had commitments to \nretain most incumbent key personnel .  Id. at 51-52.  Owl argues that the Navy correctly \ncharacterized  this difference as representing a significant advantage to the agency, but \nthe evaluators  then unreasonably discounted that  conclusion in the overall assessment \nunder the personnel element.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-25.   \n Additionally, Owl argues that the Navy made multiple errors in evaluating PCCI \u2019s \nproposal.  For one, t he protester contends that the Navy unreasonably minimized the \nsignificance of PCCI proposing a program manager who lacked relevant on-site and \nfield experience and who allegedly would not be committed fully to the ESSM program.  \nId. at 25- 27.  Further, Owl argues that the evaluation of PCCI also overlooked \nweaknesses that should have been assessed for proposing inexperienced personnel in multiple roles, (principally its [ DELETED] ).  Id. at 25-28.  More generally, Owl contends \nthat the evaluation of PCCI \u2019s proposal under element A failed  to adequately consider \nrisks arising from PCCI proposing to change over most key personnel roles ( as those \nincumbents were exclusively committed to Owl) and broadly for proposing personnel \nwho lacked experience.  Id. at 26-27.   \n The Navy counters that its evaluation reasonably assessed both firms \u2019 proposals under \ntechnical element A.   The agency argues that it accurately recognized the advantages \nand weaknesses of both firms \u2019 proposals , and that Owl\u2019s protest centers on \ndisagreement with the agency \u2019s evaluation judgments, principally the agency \u2019s \njudgment about the value of specific aspects which the agency subsequently \ndetermined were offset by distinct aspects of PCCI \u2019s proposal, and whether Owl \u2019s \nremaining advantage to the agency under the personnel element was more significant than the agency \u2019s considered evaluation judgment concluded.  Memorandum of \nLaw (MOL) at 3 -10.  None of these allegations provide a basis to sustain the protest, the \nNavy argues .   \nIn reviewing a protester \u2019s challenges to a technical evaluation, our Office affords \ndiscretion to the procuring agency because it is responsible both for defining its needs \nand assessing the best method for accommodating them.  So, in reviewing an agency \u2019s \nevaluation, our Office does not reevaluate the technical proposals, but instead we  Page 10   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 examine the agency \u2019s evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with \nthe solicitation\u2019 s stated evaluation criteria and with procurement statutes and \nregulations.  Shearwater Sys. LLC , B-413573 et al. , Nov. 16, 2016,  2016 CPD \u00b6  335 \nat 3.  Where an agency \u2019s evaluation judgment is reasonable, a protester \u2019s disagreement \nwith that judgment is insufficient to provide a basis to sustain the protest. XLA Assocs., \nInc., B-412333.2, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CP D \u00b6 54 at 6.  Also, where a protester contends \nthat the record shows unequal evaluation treatment, the protester must show that the \ndifference in the evaluation did not result from differences in the offerors \u2019 proposals  that \nsupport the differing evaluation judgments .  A&T Sys., Inc. , B-410767, Feb. 10, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 95 at 3.   \nThe record confirms the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation of both proposals \nunder element A, personnel.  In particular, the evaluation recognized and assigned a significant strength to Owl \u2019s proposal regarding the retention of incumbent key  \npersonnel  and most  incumbent non- key personnel.   But the agency also found \nacceptable PCCI \u2019s approach which provided committed candidates for all key personnel \npositions, even if most were not the incumbent s in their positions.  The protester  and the \nagency  differ in their views of Owl\u2019 s overall advantage under element A, which the \nagency valued less than the protester contends it should have.  That judgment is a matter of agency discretion and, on the record here, there is no basis for our Office to conclude that the Navy \u2019s judgment that the value to the Navy of Owl\u2019 s advantage under \nthe personnel element was slight, was an unreasonable judgment.  See XLA Assocs., \nInc., supra, at 6.  \n Next, Owl contends the agency unequally evaluated proposals.  And while the record \nconfirms that both firms proposed the same person for lead engineer , the record \nnevertheless supports the agency \u2019s evaluation judgment to assess  a weakness to Owl \u2019s \nproposal for the lack of a credentialed professional engineer but not PCCI \u2019s.  The \nagency determined that PCCI \u2019s proposal should not receive the same weakness \nbecause PCCI proposed [ DELETED] , thereby supplying the missing skills and \nprofessional credential  and effectively mitigating the agency \u2019s concern.  Although Owl \nbelieves that the mitigation is insignificant because the employee is  [DELETED] , the \nrecord is clear that PCCI , unlike Owl, expressly offer ed to hav e a [DELETED] .  \nAccordingly, our review supports the reasonableness of the agency \u2019s evaluation \njudgment in this regard and does not demonstrate unequal treatment ; rather, the firms \u2019 \nproposed different approaches support the reasonableness of the evaluation of each, even though the same lead engineer was proposed by both and did not possess a \nprofessional engineer credential for either offeror.   \n With respect to Owl \u2019s challenges to whether PCCI \u2019s proposed personnel possessed \nsufficient experience, we again conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation.  The evaluation considered the qualifications of each of PCCI \u2019s \ncandidates for the positions challenged by Owl , compared them to the position \nrequirements in the RFP,  and concluded that the candidates were acceptable.  For \nexample, t he resume for PCCI \u2019s program manager showed that the candidate had \n35 years of experienc e supporting the ESSM program that included on- site and field \nexperience , which plainly satisfied the RFP \u2019s qualifications requirement.  Compare AR,  Page 11   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Tab 2a, RFP attach. J -2, at 8 (requiring the program manager to have 15 years of \nexperience  in \u201cmanagement of [g]overnment contract activities \u201d) with AR, Tab 8 a, PCCI \nTech. Proposal at 30 (listing proposed program manager experience as including over \n30 years of qualifying experience  supporting the ESSM program ).  Ultimately, Owl\u2019s \nprotest fails to show that the Navy \u2019s evaluation judgments in identifying and determining \nthe significance of weaknesses in PCCI \u2019s personnel under element A was \nunreasonable.   \n Under element B , management, Owl argues that the Navy unreasonably  evaluated \nPCCI \u2019s approach as superior to Owl \u2019s, both as to their transition plans and their training \nplans .  The firm challenges a weakness  the Navy assessed for the firm\u2019 s transition plan \nunder technical element B, which was based on language in Owl \u2019s proposal indicating \nthat its approach included transition functions being performed [ DELETED] .  Protest at  \n7.  Owl argues that the evaluation misinterpreted that aspect of its approach as \nrequiring staff to perform transition duties [ DELETED] .  Id.  The firm argues that its \nproposal only proposed t o have a limited set of key personnel \u201c provide limited on- site \nsupport, as necessary \u201d to supplement a dedicated transition staff.  Id.  at 36.   \nAdditionally, rather than assessing a weakness, the approach instead should have been recognized as providing value through the retention of knowledgeable incumbent personnel.  Id.\n6   \n \n6 Owl also argues that the Navy conducted misleading discussions  by identifying \nconcerns with the risks and lack of mitigation in its approach to transition.  Owl \nmaintains that it was misled to emphasize the lack of transition risks rather than address \nthe agency \u2019s concern that its approach posed a risk by overburdening its staff with \n[DELETED ] transition duties .  Owl maintains that the discussions also misled it by not \ndirecting its response to focus on providing specificity about its transition.  Protest at 7, 39; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  To be meaningful, discussions must be \nsufficiently detailed to lead an offeror to the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or revision.   Partnership for Supply Chain Mgmt. , B-411490, B -411490.2, Aug. 11, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 252 at 5 .   \nOwl fails to show that the agency \u2019s discussion inquiry was misleading; rather, the record \nshows that the agency identified a concern that the approach did not adequately identify transition risks and did not explain how areas of risk would be mitigated.   Indeed, the \nagency \u2019s discussion communication quoted from Owl \u2019s proposal regarding the \ninvolvement of [ DELETED]  in transition, and then expressed the concern that the \napproach did not give the evaluators confidence that the firm had  properly analyzed the \ntransition process from the incumbent joint venture to Owl itself being the contractor.  \nAR, Tab 3, Navy Discussions to Owl at 1- 2.  Contrary to Owl \u2019s arguments, the \ndiscussions thus reasonably led Owl to the area of the agency \u2019s evaluated concern \nabout the source of risk in its transition approach and the firm\u2019 s apparent failure to \nappreciate and mitigate the risk.  While Owl \u2019s final proposal revision failed to allay the \nconcerns raised by the agency, that outcome does not demonstrate a flaw in the agency \u2019s discussions.    Page 12   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Owl also argues that the Navy misevaluated PCCI \u2019s proposal by failing to assess \nweaknesses because PCCI did not propose incumbent key personnel, and therefore its \ntransition would necessarily involve significant risk .  Owl contends  this was confirmed \nafter award when PCCI sought information about personnel, benefits, and ongoing \norders that allegedly show the firm lacked a feasible approach to transition.  Protest \nat 7, 41-42.   \n \nOwl also challenges a weakness assessed against its proposal for  its proposed training \nplan.   Specifically, the agency identified a weakness with Owl \u2019s propos al to provide \nunderwater ships husbandry (UWSH)7 training.  T he agency concluded that Owl \u2019s plan \nreflected an overreliance on conducting training during [DELETED] .  The Navy deemed \nreliance on [ DELETED]  for training problematic because their scheduling was uncertain \nand, [DELETED] .  Owl counters that its UWSH training was multifaceted, and only one \nelement was to send personnel to \u201c receive regular training during [ DELETED] .\u201d  \nAdditionally, Owl contends that its plan provided that personnel would only be assigned to [DELETED]  if they had other duties to perform.  Protest at 4 3-45.   \n \nThe Navy argues that the evaluation under element B was reasonable and consistent \nwith the evaluation criteria.  With respect to the firms \u2019 respective transition approaches, \nthe agency argues that , contrary to Owl \u2019s description of its transition approach as \nseamless and low risk, its proposal was reasonably assessed a weakness because the \nfirm failed to appreciate and address the risk in transitioning from performance by the \nincumbent joint venture to Owl itself, notably including the approach of having \n[DELETED ].\n8  MOL at  12-15.  In contrast, the agency argues, PCCI \u2019s approach to \ntransition was detailed and insightful , and the evaluation explained in detail why the \nfirm\u2019s approach provided confidence in the firm \u2019s ability to accomplish a smooth and \nseamless transition, and thus merited a strength.   Id. at 16; AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at \n15.  The agency argues that PCCI \u2019s efforts to obtain information from Owl after award, \nas an effort to facilitate the transition,  do not support the protester \u2019s claim that PCCI \u2019s \nproposed transition plan (or, for that matter, its approach to recruiting and retaining \npersonnel) was defective.  MOL at 30.  In addition, the agency asserts  that those events \nare matters of contract administr ation rather than evidence of a flaw in the evaluation of \nPCCI \u2019s transition plan under technical element B .  Id.   \n \n \n7 In brief, UWSH involves performing ship maintenance or  repair underwater.  The \ncontract requires the contractor to maintain prepositioned equipment that is needed to \nperform UWSH tasks, so the contractor personnel who maintain that equipment and support it when deployed must receive training to ensure their s kills are current.   \n8 Owl argues that any legitimate concern about its plan to transition duties [ DELETED]  \nwas mitigated by proposing the possibility of obtaining an agreement from the \nincumbent joint venture for the key personnel to perform transition duties  [DELETED] .  \nWe see no error in the Navy \u2019s decision not to give this alternative any weight because it \nwas merely hypothetical.    Page 13   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 With respect to Owl\u2019 s UWSH training plan, the Navy argues that the evaluation \nreasonably assessed Owl \u2019s approach and determined that using [ DELETED]  \nopportunities as an element of the approach represented overreliance on an approach \nthat was uncertain and inconsistent.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 27.  To the extent Owl \nargues that the agency focused unreasonably on one element of its UWSH techniques, the agency counters that the proposal identified training during [DELETED]  as \nsignificant, stating that the f irm\u2019s \u201cUWSH mechanics receive regular training [ DELETED]  \nto qualify and stay proficient on all ESSM UWSH equipment and tools .\u201d  AR, Tab 9a, \nOwl Tech . Proposal at 85 (proposal page No. I -64).  At the same time, the evaluators \nfound that Owl \u2019s proposal did not provide detail about the significance and scope of the \nother training elements , making only brief mention of [ DELETED] , and thus the \nevaluators \u2019 assessment of a weakness was reasonable.  MOL at  20.   \n Our review of the record supports the Navy \u2019s evaluation of both weaknesses.  \nAccordingly, we deny Owl \u2019s challenges to the evaluation under element B.\n9  As \ndescribed above, the agency identified a reasonable concern about the increased risk \nresulting from  Owl\u2019s proposed transition approach, which included key personnel  \n[DELETED ].  See AR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at  117 (proposal page No.  I-96, \nstating \u201c[w]e understand that during the transition period [ DELETED] \u201d).  Although Owl \nargues that the risk was minimal and manageable, the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation of that element of the approach as a \nweakness.  The record also shows that the Navy reasonably found PCCI \u2019s transition \napproach had merit even though it did not include most of the incumbent key personnel including PCCI \u2019s identification of transition risks and mitigation strategies.   \nSimilarly, the record supports the Navy \u2019s assessment of a weakness to Owl for its \nUWSH training approach.  The evaluators reasonably understood Owl \u2019s approach as \nidentifying an essential element of its UWSH training as  occurring [DELETED] .  See \nAR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at 86- 87 (proposal page Nos. I -65 to I -66, explaining \nimportance of [DELETED]  experience for mechanics, identifying specific equipment \ntraining as \u201c [DELETED] ,\u201d and that salvage- specific training \u201c will typically [ DELETED] \u201d).  \nThe agency also reasonably viewed reliance presented a risk first because [DELETED] \ndid not always take place when planned, and second because it could promot e \ninefficient  expenditure of time and expense to [ DELETED] .  Accordingly, we deny Owl \u2019s \nchallenges to the evaluation under technical element B.   \n \n9 In addition to challenging its own evaluation, Owl also argues that PCCI \u2019s approach to \nUWSH should have been evaluated as inadequate and lacking detail but was instead unreasonably assessed as a strength.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The Navy refutes Owl \u2019s challenge, noting that the evaluators credited PCCI for  proposing to \nprovide training [ DELETED] , and would provide the training [ DELETED] , all of which the \nevaluators viewed as valuable.  MOL at 3 3.  Even if PCCI \u2019s UWSH approach was not \ndescribed in detail, the record supports the reasonableness of the assessment of a significant strength for PCCI \u2019s UWSH training.   Page 14   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Next, Owl challenges the evaluation under both element C, technical capability and \nexperience , and factor 2, past performance.  Owl contends that the evaluation under \nboth criteria unreasonably found that both firms had the same experience in performing \nESSM as a result of their roles in the incumbent joint venture, despite Owl \u2019s assertion \nthat it was both the majority owner of the joint venture and performed more of the work .  \nAlthough the element C evaluation concluded that Owl had a slight advantage over PCCI, Owl argues that its own role in the incumbent joint venture was much more \nsignificant than PCCI \u2019s and should have been c onsidered significantly superior.  The \nprotester alleges that PCCI did not perform many SOW requirements (such as training, \nmanagement, and specialty system procurement)  and, consequen tly, the evaluation \nshould have recognized a significant advantage for Owl over PCCI.  Protest at 65.  The protester also asserts that the Navy should have known that PCCI \u2019s claims of broad \nexperience and past performance under the incumbent contract were inaccurate, and that the evaluation was improper because it was based on alleged misrepresentations \nby PCCI.  Protest at  61-64; Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 36.  \n The Navy argues that the evaluation of experience and capability under technical element C, and the evaluation of past performance, were both reasonable.  The Navy maintains that regardless of Owl \u2019s role in the joint venture, PCCI \u2019s proposal adequately \ndemonstrated the firm \u2019s possession of the range of experience in ESSM requirements \nand related areas.  MOL at 40- 42.  The agency notes that PCCI has been involved in \nthe incumbent joint venture for more than 30 years.  Additionally, the agency notes that in at least one area where PCCI lack ed experience and past performance on the ESSM \ncontract, it demonstrated that experience and past performance on a non- ESSM \ncontract.  Id. at 43.  The agency contends that it reasonably concluded that both firms \ndemonstrated the required capability and experience and relevant past performance, and concluded that both firms \u2019 evaluations had similar merit , and Owl \u2019s advantage \nunder the experience element was slight .   \n In response to Owl \u2019s contention that PCCI misrepresented its role in the incumbent \ncontract and thus misled the Navy with respect to the firm \u2019s experience and past \nperformance, PCCI directly disputes each of the alleged misrepresentations.  PCCI \u2019s \npresident avers that the firm participates actively in management through two members of the joint venture\u2019 s five -member board, and its executive filled the roles of chief \noperating officer (and two subordinates) until 2021, contrary to Owl \u2019s claim that the \nawardee has had little involvement in management.  Intervenor \u2019s Supp. Comments \nat 21; exh. A, Decl. of PCCI President at 1.  Further, the awardee explains that its \npersonnel often interact directly with the Navy during performance of the incumbent contract.  Id.  The firm also challenges the contention that PCCI \u2019s proposed program \nmanager has had little on- site experience during performance of the incumbent \ncontract, supporting its claim with multiple examples by the candidate of both on- site \nperformance and serv ice as the primary point of contact for specific projects.  Id.; \nexh. B, Decl. of PCCI Chief Exec. Officer at 6 -8.   \nIn a protest challenging the evaluation of experience or past performance, our Office considers the evaluation to be generally committed to the discretion of the contracting \nagency , so we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance  Page 15   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 ratings.  We will review the record to determine whether the agency conducted the \nevaluation fairly, reasonably, and in accordance with the solicitation\u2019 s evaluation \nscheme, and whether it was based on relevant information sufficient to make a \nreasonable assessment of the offeror \u2019s experience and record of performance.   Fidelity \nDecypher Servs., LLC , B-418542.2; B -418542.3, Aug. 26, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 309 at 6; \nHuman Resource Sys., Inc.; Health Staffers, Inc., B -262254.3 et al. , Dec. 21, 1995, \n96-1 CPD \u00b6 35 at 4.   \n We see no basis to find unreasonable the evaluative weight the agency assessed for \nexperience and past performance between the joint venture members  that Owl \ncontends was required.  To the contrary, PCCI explains that our Office has recognized experience and past performance gained by a joint venture can properly be credited to a member of the joint venture that is involved in the performance.  Intervenor \u2019s Supp. \nComments at 3 (citing  Diversified Tech. & Servs. of Virginia, Inc. , B-412090.2, \nB-412090.3, Dec . 16, 2015, 2016 CPD \u00b6 34 at 9 and Battelle Mem \u2019l Inst., B-278673, \nFeb. 27, 1998, 98- 1 CPD \u00b6 107 at 22 ).  While Owl contends that the evaluation had to \nconsider its own experience superior because of its slightly greater ownership of the joint venture (51 percent versus 49 percent)  and allegedly more comprehensive \ninvolvement in performance, the agency reasonably evaluated both and, although there were differences, the agency reasonably concluded that the difference did not \ndistinguish one above the other u nder either technical element C or the past \nperformance factor.  Nor does the record provide a basis to conclude that PCCI \nmisrepresented its experience or past performance under the incumbent contract given the firm\u2019 s direct and detailed rebuttal of the protester \u2019s allegation of misrepresentations.  \nOwl has provided no basis to sustain its challenges to those evaluations.   \n Under element D, Owl argues that the Navy misevaluated the firm \u2019s sample problem \nresponse.   The sample problem required each offeror to provide a response to a \nscenario in which a collision between a Navy ship and a barge that caused damage and evidence of leaking hydraulic fluid and heavy black oil into the water.  AR, Tab 2f, \nSample Problem at 1.   The instructions included two tentative equipment lists, and \ndirected offerors to prepare a plan to respond, that should include \u201c any \nrecommendations [the offeror] would make to equipment lists and\/or mobilization strategies with justifications for t hose recommendations.  Id. at 2.   \n Owl argues that its approach was derived from the extensive experience of its \nincumbent key personnel and should not have been assessed a weakness for a discrepancy .  Protest at 55 .  The firm argues that its sample problem response included \nthe tentative equipment list that the agency had supplied in a r equisition and \ninvoice\/ shipping document  (known as DD1149) , but also listed additional equipment \nitems separately.  Id. at 56.   The Navy assessed weakness es because of discrepancies \nin the documentation of equipment Owl proposed to utilize, and in the timing of its equipment shipments.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 33.   The firm argues that the \nassessment of weakness es was based on an unreasonable interpretation of Owl \u2019s \nsample problem respons e.   \n  Page 16   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The Navy argues that the sample problem evaluation was reasonable.  The agency \nnotes that the sample problem was timed and was intended to assess the offeror \u2019s \nability to evaluate an emergent situation and prepare a clear plan to respond.  The discrepancy between the equipment lists showed discrepancies over the need for a \nspecific piece of equipment (a stern tube cofferdam) and the firm listed different shipping timelines  for needed equipment .  Compare AR, Tab 10, Owl Sample Problem \nResponse at 14- 17 with 19 (required equipment documentation), 22 with 24 (equipment \narrival timing); MOL at 44- 45.  The agency explains that if the sample problem had been \na real -world event, the discrepancies could interfere with efficient response to the \nsituation and could result in a needed piece of equipment failing to ship to the incident \non time.  The issue reasonably resulted in assessment of a weakness, the agency contends.  Id. at 45.   \n Based on our review of the record, the agency \u2019s technical evaluation of Owl \u2019s sample \nproblem response was reasonable.  The RFP provided that the sample problem response would be evaluated to assess the offeror \u2019s response in a problem -solving \nexercise, whether the offeror understood and would respond to the requirements of the scenario.  It advised offerors to provide comprehensive responses that address the full extent of support and field operations as if it were a real -world event.  AR, Tab 2, RFP \nat 80.  By providing equipment documentation and shipping timelines that were \ninconsistent, Owl \u2019s sample problem response was reasonably assessed a weakness.  \nIn sum, we deny all of Owl \u2019s technical factor evaluation challenges.   \nOther Cost\/Price Evaluation Challenges  \n \nUnder the cost\/price factor, apart from the challenge to the Navy \u2019s failure to properly \nevaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 discussed above, \nOwl also argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider the risk posed by PCCI \u2019s \nproposal of low indirect cost rates and further, a proposed ceiling, or cap,  on its  indirect \ncost rate.  The firm argues that PCCI \u2019s approach involves  establishment of  [DELETED]  \nfor cost purposes, and that the available data of audited rates for PCCI \u2019s [DELETED]  \ncalculated [DELETED]  indirect rates than the firm proposed.   Those circumstances \nindicate a significant risk , it contends,  because by [DELETED] , PCCI will be unable to \nrecover its cost of performance under the ESSM contract .  As a result, Owl argues that \nperformance of the contract at PCCI \u2019s proposed costs will place the firm  in financial \ndistress and will incentivize the firm to minimize its efforts on the contract to lim it its \nlosses .  Owl argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider these risks in evaluating \nPCCI \u2019s cost proposal .   \n The Navy argues that its evaluation of both firms \u2019 costs proposals was consistent with \nthe evaluation criteria in the RFP .  The agency acknowledges that the RFP provided \nthat the cost evaluation would include a cost realism assessment for offeror\u2019 s indirect \nrates .  However, it encouraged offerors to propose indirect rate ceilings and further \nexplained their treatment as follows:   Page 17   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Evaluation of Indirect Rates and Ceilings  \n \nIf the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost -\nrealism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the proposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.   If proposed indirect rates are considered to \nbe unrealistic, the Offeror \u2019s proposed rates will be adjusted upward to \ndetermine the Government evaluated indirect rate .  No downward \nadjustment will be made to an Offeror \u2019s rates during the cost realism \nanalysis . \n If the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate represents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic .  \n RFP at 113  (\u00a7 M, 2.3.1.2). \n The Navy argues that since both offerors proposed caps on all indirect costs, the Navy \nproperly calculated each firm \u2019s costs by using the capped rates and deem ing the firm\u2019s \ncapped rates to be realistic .  The Navy maintains that the evaluation was consistent with \nthe RFP, and that the evaluation of risk from PCCI \u2019s allegedly low indirect rates and \nceilings, that Owl argues  for, was not required under the term s of the RFP .   \n As a general principle, the FAR provides that when evaluating offerors \u2019 costs for a \ncost-reimbursement contract, the agency must assess the realism of the offeror \u2019s \nproposed costs; that is, a cost realism analysis .  FAR 15 .404-1.  The requirement to \nassess cost realism is to recognize that the offeror \u2019s proposed costs are not dispositive \nin a cost -reimbursement environment ; that is, even if the offeror proposes that its costs \nwill be low, the government generally will be liable to the contractor for all allowable and \nallocable costs incurred in connection with the performance of the contract .  Vectrus \nMission Sols . Corp .; Vanquish Worldwide, LLC , B-418942 et al., Oct . 27, 2020, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 87 at 5 .  The analysis involves   \n \nindependently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror \u2019s \nproposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials descri bed in the offeror \u2019s technical \nproposal . \n FAR 15 .404-1(d)(1) .   \n Here, t he record does not show a basis to sustain Owl \u2019s challenges to the evaluation of \nPCCI \u2019s costs,  even if its proposal included indirect cost caps  that turn out to be far \nbelow the costs that PCCI will actually incur  during performance.   While a cost realism  Page 18   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 analysis may provide a basis to consider the risk posed by an offeror proposing cost \ncaps that could create incentives for minimal or poor performance, the RFP here \nexpressly provided that the Navy would consider proposed indirect cost caps to be \nrealistic , hence, without regard to the cap level or the potential effects, such as an \nofferor \u2019s potential financial losses or distorted performance incentives .  Accordingly , the \nagency \u2019s treatment of PCCI\u2019 s capped indirect rates as realistic (and likewise for Owl10) \nwas consistent with the RFP .  Accordingly, we deny the protest er\u2019s challenges to the \nevaluation under the cost\/price factor .   \n Tradeoff  \n Finally, although Owl challenges the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s tradeoff  and \nselection of PCCI \u2019s proposal, we do not reach the merits of these challenges because \nwe conclude that without properly evaluating the offerors \u2019 professional compensation as \nthe RFP provided, the Navy could not reasonably select PCCI \u2019s proposal as the best \nvalue.  Accordingly, we sustain the challenge to the agency\u2019s tradeoff .   \n RECOMMENDATION  We recommend that the Navy reevaluate offerors \u2019 proposals in accordance with the \nRFP, and in particular FAR provision 52.222- 46.  If the Navy \u2019s evaluation reasonably \ndetermines that an offeror \u2019s professional compensation is unrealistically low , the Navy \nshould consider whether the circumstances justify rejecting the proposal, pursuant to \nFAR provision 52.222- 46(d).   The Navy may consider reopening discussions if the Navy \ndetermines that obtaining more information would be in the agency\u2019s interest.   We \nfurther recommend that the Navy make a new source selection determination and, if \nPCCI is not selected for award, we recommend that the agency terminate the award to PCCI for the convenience of the government and make a new award, if otherwise \nproper.  Finally, we recommend that the agency reimburse Owl\u2019 s costs associated with \nfiling and pursuing these protests, including reasonable attorneys \u2019 fees.  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.8(d)(1).  Owl should submit its certified claim for costs, detailing the time expended \nand costs incurred, directly to the contracting agency within 60 days after the receipt of \nthis decision.   \n \nThe protest is sustained in part and denied in part .   \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n10 Owl notes that the Navy assessed the realism of Owl \u2019s proposal of a [ DELETED]  \npercent overhead rate for certain costs .  Comments & Supp.  Protest at 39.   However, as \nOwl also acknowledges, the Navy determined that Owl \u2019s approach was proper , so the \nfirm was not prejudiced by that allegedly improper realism assessment .",

This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 hazardous substance spill response program  worldwide .  The incumbent contractor is a \njoint venture named Global PCCI JV, whose majority owner at 51 percent is the \nprotester , Owl, and the awardee, PCCI, is the minority owner  at 49 percent .  Owl \ncontends that the Navy misevaluated both firms \u2019 proposals and made an unreasonable \nsource selection decision.   \n \nWe sustain the protest  in part and deny it in part .   \n BACKGROUND  \n The Navy issued the RFP on September 28, 2023, to obtain proposals to provide \nservices under an indefinite- delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract for five years, \nwith a maximum value of $315 million.   Agency Report ( AR), Tab 2 , Consolidated RFP \nat 1-3.  Offeror s were directed to price services on a cost -plus-award- fee basis for \noperational efforts, and on a cost -plus-fixed -fee basis for nonoperational efforts .  Id. \nat 2.  The RFP included a statement of work  (SOW) that described the general scope of \nthe contract as providing engineering and technical services to support the ESSM system, provide operational and nonoperational support to the Navy \u2019s oil and hazardous \nsubstance spill response program.  Additionally, the contractor would provide equipment operation, maintenance, and related support at remote sites for a range of operations.   \nId. at 15. \n The RFP instructed offerors to submit proposals in three volumes:  t echnical (volume I), \ncost\/price (volume II), and solicitation package (volume III) .  Id. at 72 .  The RFP \nanticipated the award of a single IDIQ contract to the offeror whose proposal was \nevaluated as offering the best value to the government .  The evaluation of proposals \nwould utilize three factors, listed in descending order of importance:  t echnical \ncapability , past performance, and c ost\/price.  Id. at 10 9.  When combined, t he technical \ncapability and past performance factors were significantly more important than cost\/price  in determining which proposal provided the best value; in other words , the \nRFP indicated that the source selection would be based on a tradeoff among the \ntechnical capability, past performance, and cost\/price factors .  Id.   \n Under the technical factor, t he RFP instructed offerors to address three elements in \ntheir technical proposals :  personnel; management\n1; and technical capability and \nexperience .  Id. at 74 -80.  Additionally, the RFP identified  a fourth technical element, a \nsample problem, and stated that it would be optional for the agency  to require .2  Id. \nat 80.  The evaluation of each element was described as follows:    \n \n1 In the record, the management element is also referred to as the management \napproach\/organization plan element .  E.g., AR, Tab 1, Contracting Officer \u2019s \nStatement  (COS) at  2.   \n2 Ultimately, after receiving proposals, the Navy  issue d a sample problem .  A challenge \nto the evaluation of PCCI\u2019s sample problem was among several issues that our Office \nindicated would likely be dismissed, but the protester subsequently withdrew  it.    Page 3   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The evaluation standard is:  \n\u2022 Element A:  Personnel .  The degree to which the proposal \ndemonstrates that the Offeror is capable of providing personnel \nwith the professional and technical skills to successfully perform the \nrequirements of the [statement of work] . \n\u2022 Element B:  Management .  The degree to which the proposal \ndemonstrates that the Offeror \u2019s management \napproach\/organization plan is adequate to accomplish program objectives and satisfy all aspects of the [statement of work] and ESSM mission requirements based on the ESSM Operations Guide.   \n\u2022 Element C:  Technical Capability and Experience.   The degree to \nwhich the proposal demonstrates that the Offeror has the \nnecessary technical capability and corporate experience related to \nstorage, maintenance and operation of ESSM -type facilities, \nequipment, and systems .  \n\u2022 Element D:  Sample Problem .  The degree to which the response to \nthe sample problem .  . . demonstrates the Offeror \u2019s understanding \nof the Government \u2019s requirements and the ability to adequately and \nrealistically solve a problem in a condensed period of time .   \n \nId. at 109- 110.   \n Within the technical capability evaluation,  proposals were to be evaluated under each of \nthe four elements  described above, but the RFP expressly stated the elements were not \nconsidered subfactors and would not be separately rated.   Id.  The RFP also listed \nsubject areas within elements that offerors were instructed to address ; for example, key \npersonnel resumes under the personnel element, and nine areas under the management approach\/organization plan element,  such as overall organizational \nstructure , staffing levels , and training .  Id. at 75- 79.  The RFP also stated that the \ntechnical capability evaluation would result in assessment of combined technical\/risk ratings using color and adjectival rating pairs:  blue\/outstanding, purple\/good, \ngreen\/acceptable, yellow\/marginal, or red\/unacceptable.   Id. at 110.   \n Under the past performance factor, the RFP indicated that the agency would evaluate the recency, relevance, and quality of the offeror \u2019s performance record.   Id. at 111.\n3  \nThe evaluation would then rate each performance reference as very relevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant.  Id.   Then, taking into account  the relevance of the \nreferences and the record of performance, the offeror \u2019s overall past performance would \nbe assessed a confidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, unknown (or neutral), limited, or no confidence.  Id.  at 112.  \n \n \n3 Where page numbering in a document differs from the electronic pagination in the \nAdobe PDF file submitted to our Office, we cite the PDF page numbering.    Page 4   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The cost\/price evaluation would be based on a total evaluated cost\/price, using cost \ninformation provided by the offeror, principally scheduled labor rates, indirect rates, and \nthe offeror \u2019s award fee\/fixed fee.  Id.   Additionally, the RFP directed offerors to complete \nan accompanying cost worksheet by providing standard and overtime labor rates, and percentages for the firm \u2019s proposed fringe benefit rate, overhead rate, and general and \nadministrative rate.  AR, Tab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2.  For scheduled labor r ates, the \nRFP explained that offerors were to propose burdened rates , excluding fee amounts, \nand therefore the Navy would \u201c only evaluate the proposed scheduled labor rates for \nreasonableness and material balance. \u201d  Id. at 113.  Additionally, the RFP incorporated \nFAR provision 52.222- 46, which provides for an assessment of the compensation of \nprofessional employees.  Id. at 90.   \n For indirect rates, the RFP specified different evaluation methods depending on whether the offeror proposed to cap its indirect rates:   \nIf the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost-realism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the \nproposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.  If proposed indirect rates are \nconsidered to be unrealistic, the Offeror \u2019s proposed rates will  be adjusted \nupward to determine the Government evaluated indirect rate.  No \ndownward adjustment will be made. . . .  \nIf the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate \nrepresents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic.  \n Id. at 113.   \n Finally, the RFP provided that for purposes of evaluation, the offeror \u2019s proposed award-\nfee and fixed- fee \u201cevaluated fee percentages will be equal to the proposed fee \npercentages. \u201d  Id.   \n \nAfter an initial evaluation, the Navy held discussions with both offerors and requested \nfinal proposal revisions.  The evaluation of final proposal revisions identified strengths and weaknesses in both firms \u2019 proposals  under the technical capability factor .  The \nagency then determined that in comparing the firms \u2019 evaluations, some strengths and \nweaknesses were offset by strengths or weaknesses of similar significance in the competing proposal, and thus were considered offsetting.  Other strengths and weaknesses were determined not to have offsetting aspects in the competitor \u2019s \nproposal, and thus provided aspects with which to discriminate between the two proposals.  AR, Tab 6, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) Report at 8- 16.  For \nthe past performance factor, the agency determined that both offerors had demonstrated performance records that were similar in relevance and quality, and that no aspect of the past performance evaluation provided a basis to distinguish between the com petitors.  Id. at 17.    Page 5   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 In addition to those discriminating strengths and weaknesses, the overall evaluation \nproduced the following ratings and total evaluated cost\/prices:   \n \n OWL  PCCI  \nTECHNICAL CAPABILITY  GOOD  OUTSTANDING  \nPAST PERFORMANCE  VERY RELEVANT\/ \nSUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE   VERY RELEVANT\/ \nSUBSTANTIAL \nCONFIDENCE   \nTOTAL EVALUATED \nCOST\/PRICE  $204 ,108,658  $214,357,758  \n AR, Tab 4, Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report at 7, 24; AR, Tab 6 , \nSSAC Report at 4; AR, Tab 7, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 3.    \nThe SSAC advised that its review determined that PCCI \u2019s proposal was superior to an \nextent that justified paying its higher total evaluated cost\/price, which represented a cost premium of 5 percent.   AR, Tab 6, SSAC Report at 18 -19.  The source selection \nauthority ( SSA) then reviewed the evaluation and tradeoff recommendation and \nconcurred with them .  AR, Tab 7, SSDD at  2.  The SSA then explained that based on \nindependent judgment, PCCI \u2019s proposal represented the best value considering its \nsuperior technical evaluation, and cost\/price premium of 5 percent.  Based on that judgment, the SSA selected PCCI for award.  Id.  at 3.  Following notice of the award \nand a debriefing, Owl filed this protest.   \n DISCUSSION  Owl challenges multiple aspects of the evaluation and source selection decision.   We \nfirst turn to the protester \u2019s argument that PCCI was not a responsible contractor, which \nwe dismiss as lacking a sufficient factual basis.  We next determine that Owl \u2019s challenge \nto the Navy \u2019s failure to perform an evaluation of the offerors \u2019 professional compensation \nis valid and we sustain the protest on that basis .  We then address the protester \u2019s \nremaining challenges to the evaluation of proposals, which we conclude are without \nmerit.    \n Challenge to Affirmative Responsibility Determination  \n Owl\u2019s protest contends that PCCI lacked the financial capacity to perform the contract, \nand that the Navy ignored information regarding that lack of financial capacity that should have caused the Navy to find the firm not responsible to perform the contract.  Protest at 66.  In this regard, Owl asserts that PCCI proposed to cap its indirect costs below their documented historical rates and contends that PCCI also lacks adequate sources of financing that it will need to perform.  Id.   In Owl \u2019s view, the circ umstances \nindicate that PCCI has less than a half million dollars in working capital, but its capped indirect costs put it at risk of financial losses that Owl argues could exceed $26 million.  Id.; see also Opp. to Req. for Dismissal at 9.  In sum, Owl argues, the lack of access to \ncapital to manage losses resulting from the firm \u2019s proposed indirect cost cap was  Page 6   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 material information that the Navy failed to adequately consider, which should have \nresulted in the Navy finding PCCI was not a responsible offeror to perform this contract.   \n The Navy argues that Owl \u2019s challenge to the affirmative responsibility determination of \nPCCI is not an aspect of responsibility that GAO reviews and should therefore be dismissed.  The RFP requirement that the contractor possess financial capability does not establish a specific objective standard that could constitute definitive responsibility criteria, the agency contends.  Req. for Dismissal at 7.  Further, the Navy argues that Owl has not identified a violation of law or regulation, or any information that would \u201crais[e] serious concerns  that . . . the contracting officer unreasonably failed to consider \navailable relevant information\u201d  regarding PCCI \u2019s responsibility.  Id . at 6.  Rather, the \nagency maintains that the record shows the contracting officer exercised reasonable business judgment in finding that PCCI was a responsible contractor.   \nOur Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. section 21.5(c), generally exclude from our \nreview, consideration of protests that challenge an affirmative responsibility determination, with limited exceptions.  Those exceptions include that our Office will consider  a protest alleging that specific objective standards of responsibility were not \nmet, and that an affirmative responsibility determination failed to adequately consider information that was known or reasonably should have been known that, by its nature, would be expected to have a strong bearing on whether the awardee should be found \nresponsible.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5(c); MVM, Inc ., B-421788. 3, B-421788. 4, Mar. 5, 2024, \n2024 CPD \u00b6 63 at 10.  Our decision in MVM  exemplifies the type of information that \nwould meet our standard, where publicly available information indicated that the awardee \u2019s affiliate had settled false claims under a contract with a federal agency.  Id.  \nThe information at issue here, in contrast, questions PCCI \u2019s need for and access to \nworking ca pital.  It does not rise to the level required by our regulations to support a \nchallenge to the Navy \u2019s responsibility determination.  Instead, Owl \u2019s allegations raise \nordinary issues of financial capacity for the Navy to resolve.  We therefore dismiss the challenge to the Navy \u2019s determination that PCCI is a responsible contractor.   \n Failure to Evaluate Professional Compensation \n \nOwl argues that the Navy failed to assess the realism of the offerors \u2019 professional \ncompensation as required by the RFP, which incorporated Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (FAR) provision 52.222-46.  Protest at  72-73.  That provision provides that \n\u201c[t]he professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact \nupon recruiting and retention,  its realism , and its consistency with a total plan for \ncompensation. \u201d  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a) .   \n The RFP instructed offerors to provide cost information in the proposal cost\/price \nvolume, including worksheet L- 2.  While the RFP instructions identified a requirement to \nprovide scheduled labor rates, indirect costs, and fringe benefit costs , RFP at 113, it \nalso instructed that all cells colored yellow in the worksheet were to be completed, which included a breakdown of the offeror \u2019s rates by location and performance period \ninto fringe rates, overhead rates, and general and administrative rates.  Id. at 84; AR, \nTab 2e, RFP Worksheet L- 2 at 6.  Thus, while t he scheduled labor rates were to be  Page 7   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 proposed as fully burdened (exclusive of fee)  fixed hourly rates , offerors were required \nto provide the applicable indirect burden percentages.   \n \nThe analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46 requires the agency to conduct \u201c in effect, a \nprice realism evaluation regarding an offeror \u2019s proposed compensation, \u201d and the agency \nmust also \u201c compare the awardee\u2019 s proposed professional compensation to the \nincumbent \u2019s.\u201d  Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, Jul.  31, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 259 at 5.    \nThe Navy and PCCI argue that this ground of protest should be dismissed because the statement that the evaluation of scheduled labor rates would only  consider \nreasonableness and balance was an obvious indication that the agency would not \nevaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52. 222-46, notwithstanding \nthe inclusion of that provision in the RFP .

Additionally , the Navy argues that the RFP also did not provide for the \nagency to obtain information needed to perform a comparison between the awardee\u2019 s \nprofessional compensation and the incumbent \u2019s, thereby making it apparent on the face \nof the RFP that the Navy would not perform the second element of the analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Req. for Dismissal at 8 -9.  The Navy also argues that the \nRFP did not reference submission of a professional compensation plan in the proposal preparation instructions or evaluation criteria and did not request salary information or a \ndescription of fringe benefits provided to professional employees.  Id.  at 9.  Accordingly , \nthe agency argues , the RFP instructions \u201c directly contradic t[ed]\u201d the evaluation that \nwould have been required under FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Id.  at 8.   \n \nWe disagree.\n4  The RFP statement limiting the evaluation of the scheduled labor rates \n(to an assessment of reasonableness and material balance) is not contradicted--directly or implicitly --by FAR provision 52.222- 46 since the evaluations consider different \ninformation.  Specifically, the scheduled labor rates are burdened rates  (what the \ncontractor will charge the government,  albeit without fee)  whereas the evaluation under \nFAR provision 52.222- 46 assesses professional employee compens ation, which \nincludes \u201csalaries and fringe benefits .\u201d  FAR provision 52.222- 46(a).  Further, although \nthe Navy contends that it was apparent to offerors that proposals would not include \nsufficient information to make an analysis under FAR provision 52.222- 46, the Navy\u2019s \nposition is not supported by the record.  W orksheet L- 2 required offerors to provide the \nNavy the means to calculate both the offeror \u2019s direct labor rate-- what the offeror will pay \nan employee--and expressly required it to provide fringe benefit rate(s)--the cost of the \nemployee\u2019s benefits relative to their wages .  We therefore conclude that the R FP \nprovided that the Navy would evaluate professional compensation consistent with FAR provision 52.222- 46, and that the RFP also required offerors to provide at least some \nminimal amount of information necessary for  the Navy to perform an evaluation.  \n \n4 Although our Office indicated that dismissal of this ground of protest as untimely \nappeared appropriate, we indicated that view was not a final decision,  and the parties \ncould raise additional arguments pending resolution of the protest in th e decision.  \nNotice of GAO Ruling on Partial Dismissal Request at 2.    Page 8   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 We have explained that t he purpose of FAR provision 52.222- 46 (titled  Evaluation of \nCompensation for Professional Employees ), is to evaluate whether an offeror will obtain \nand keep the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract \nperformance, and to evaluate whether it understands the nature of the work to be \nperformed.  In the context of a contract where labor is priced by fixed  hourly rates , our \nOffice has noted that this FAR provision anticipates an evaluation of whether the offeror \nunderstands the contract \u2019s requirements and has offered a compensation plan \nappropriate for those requirements , which requires assessing the offeror \u2019s proposed \nprofessional compensation.  The depth of the analysis is a matter of the procuring \nagency \u2019s judgment, and so, in reviewing a protest challenging the evaluation, we will \nassess whether the agency \u2019s evaluation was reasonabl e and consistent with the \nsolicitation.   Criterion Sys ., Inc., B-419749 et al. , July  21, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  261 at 6- 7.   \n Here, t he Navy failed to assess the information provided in the offerors \u2019 proposals \nregarding professional compensation; it made no assess ment  of the realism of either \nofferor \u2019s professional compensation or whether it was lower than the incumbent \u2019s \ncompensation of professionals.  Indeed, the agency emphatically asserts that there was \u201cno doubt that the Navy would not obtain the information needed to evaluate the \nproposals in accordance with FAR 52.222- 46 and would not in fact conduct the \nevaluation. \u201d  See  Navy Req. for Dismissal at 8.   In res ponse to a question posed by Owl \nduring its debriefing, the Navy stated that \u201cThe capability to recruit and\/or retain personnel at proposed scheduled labor rates was not a specific requirement under Factor 3.0 [the cost\/price factor]  and was therefore not evaluated for Volume II [the \ncost\/price  proposal].\u201d  Protest exhs. 21- 30, exh. 27, Responses to Owl Debriefing \nQuestions at 73 (Answer No. 12).\n5   \n The RFP included FAR provision 52.222- 46, which provided that the agency would \nassess professional compensation.  The RFP required offerors to provide sufficient information for the Navy to assess, at a minimum, the offeror \u2019s direct rate s and fringe \nbenefit rates.  Because the Navy failed to perform the analysis required by FAR provision 52.222- 46, we sustain this ground of protest.   \nTechnical Evaluation Challenges  \n \nTurning to the remaining allegations, Owl raises many challenges to the evaluation of \nboth firms \u2019 proposals .  Owl argues that the technical evaluation was unreasonable in \nmultiple respects within each element .  Broadly, Owl contends that the Navy failed to \nreasonably consider significant differences in the proposed approaches and the \nresulting performance risk of both offerors, the agency unreasonably undervalued Owl \u2019s \nretention of most incumbent staff , treated the offerors unequally , and it erroneously \nevaluated PCCI \u2019s experience based, at least in part, on misrepresentations .  The \n \n5 Since, as noted above, the depth of the evaluation is principally a matter for the \nagency to determine, the fact that the agency did not request or obtain detailed \ncompensation plans from either offeror does not mitigate the failure to evaluate the inform ation that was submitted.    Page 9   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 protester also challenges the past performance evaluation as unreasonable and \ncontends that the cost evaluation failed to assess the risk posed by PCCI \u2019s indirect cost \nrate caps .  We have reviewed all of Owl \u2019s additional arguments and conclude that none, \nwith the exception of the agency\u2019s failure to evaluate professional compensation discussed above, provides a basis to sustain the protest .  We discuss only the most \nsignificant allegations below.   \n Under element A, personnel, the protester argues that the Navy unreasonably failed to \nrecognize that Owl \u2019s proposed approach provided significant advantages over PCCI \u2019s, \nand that the agency unreasonably discounted those advantages and mischaracterized \nOwl as having only a slight advantage.  Protest at 50- 51.  T he protester contends that \nits proposal provided significant unique value because it would retain [DELETED]  the \nincumbent key personnel ( [DELETED]  of 22 positions , of which nearly all made \nexclusive commitments to Owl ) and would also retain [ DELETED]  of the non- key \npersonnel , while  PCCI \u2019s proposal  did not provide that the firm had commitments to \nretain most incumbent key personnel .  Id. at 51-52.  Owl argues that the Navy correctly \ncharacterized  this difference as representing a significant advantage to the agency, but \nthe evaluators  then unreasonably discounted that  conclusion in the overall assessment \nunder the personnel element.  Id.; Comments & Supp. Protest at  24-25.   \n Additionally, Owl argues that the Navy made multiple errors in evaluating PCCI \u2019s \nproposal.  For one, t he protester contends that the Navy unreasonably minimized the \nsignificance of PCCI proposing a program manager who lacked relevant on-site and \nfield experience and who allegedly would not be committed fully to the ESSM program.  \nId. at 25- 27.  Further, Owl argues that the evaluation of PCCI also overlooked \nweaknesses that should have been assessed for proposing inexperienced personnel in multiple roles, (principally its [ DELETED] ).  Id. at 25-28.  More generally, Owl contends \nthat the evaluation of PCCI \u2019s proposal under element A failed  to adequately consider \nrisks arising from PCCI proposing to change over most key personnel roles ( as those \nincumbents were exclusively committed to Owl) and broadly for proposing personnel \nwho lacked experience.  Id. at 26-27.   \n The Navy counters that its evaluation reasonably assessed both firms \u2019 proposals under \ntechnical element A.   The agency argues that it accurately recognized the advantages \nand weaknesses of both firms \u2019 proposals , and that Owl\u2019s protest centers on \ndisagreement with the agency \u2019s evaluation judgments, principally the agency \u2019s \njudgment about the value of specific aspects which the agency subsequently \ndetermined were offset by distinct aspects of PCCI \u2019s proposal, and whether Owl \u2019s \nremaining advantage to the agency under the personnel element was more significant than the agency \u2019s considered evaluation judgment concluded.  Memorandum of \nLaw (MOL) at 3 -10.  None of these allegations provide a basis to sustain the protest, the \nNavy argues .   \nIn reviewing a protester \u2019s challenges to a technical evaluation, our Office affords \ndiscretion to the procuring agency because it is responsible both for defining its needs \nand assessing the best method for accommodating them.  So, in reviewing an agency \u2019s \nevaluation, our Office does not reevaluate the technical proposals, but instead we  Page 10   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 examine the agency \u2019s evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with \nthe solicitation\u2019 s stated evaluation criteria and with procurement statutes and \nregulations.  Shearwater Sys. LLC , B-413573 et al. , Nov. 16, 2016,  2016 CPD \u00b6  335 \nat 3.  Where an agency \u2019s evaluation judgment is reasonable, a protester \u2019s disagreement \nwith that judgment is insufficient to provide a basis to sustain the protest. XLA Assocs., \nInc., B-412333.2, Jan. 29, 2016, 2016 CP D \u00b6 54 at 6.  Also, where a protester contends \nthat the record shows unequal evaluation treatment, the protester must show that the \ndifference in the evaluation did not result from differences in the offerors \u2019 proposals  that \nsupport the differing evaluation judgments .  A&T Sys., Inc. , B-410767, Feb. 10, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 95 at 3.   \nThe record confirms the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation of both proposals \nunder element A, personnel.  In particular, the evaluation recognized and assigned a significant strength to Owl \u2019s proposal regarding the retention of incumbent key  \npersonnel  and most  incumbent non- key personnel.   But the agency also found \nacceptable PCCI \u2019s approach which provided committed candidates for all key personnel \npositions, even if most were not the incumbent s in their positions.  The protester  and the \nagency  differ in their views of Owl\u2019 s overall advantage under element A, which the \nagency valued less than the protester contends it should have.  That judgment is a matter of agency discretion and, on the record here, there is no basis for our Office to conclude that the Navy \u2019s judgment that the value to the Navy of Owl\u2019 s advantage under \nthe personnel element was slight, was an unreasonable judgment.  See XLA Assocs., \nInc., supra, at 6.  \n Next, Owl contends the agency unequally evaluated proposals.  And while the record \nconfirms that both firms proposed the same person for lead engineer , the record \nnevertheless supports the agency \u2019s evaluation judgment to assess  a weakness to Owl \u2019s \nproposal for the lack of a credentialed professional engineer but not PCCI \u2019s.  The \nagency determined that PCCI \u2019s proposal should not receive the same weakness \nbecause PCCI proposed [ DELETED] , thereby supplying the missing skills and \nprofessional credential  and effectively mitigating the agency \u2019s concern.  Although Owl \nbelieves that the mitigation is insignificant because the employee is  [DELETED] , the \nrecord is clear that PCCI , unlike Owl, expressly offer ed to hav e a [DELETED] .  \nAccordingly, our review supports the reasonableness of the agency \u2019s evaluation \njudgment in this regard and does not demonstrate unequal treatment ; rather, the firms \u2019 \nproposed different approaches support the reasonableness of the evaluation of each, even though the same lead engineer was proposed by both and did not possess a \nprofessional engineer credential for either offeror.   \n With respect to Owl \u2019s challenges to whether PCCI \u2019s proposed personnel possessed \nsufficient experience, we again conclude that the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation.  The evaluation considered the qualifications of each of PCCI \u2019s \ncandidates for the positions challenged by Owl , compared them to the position \nrequirements in the RFP,  and concluded that the candidates were acceptable.  For \nexample, t he resume for PCCI \u2019s program manager showed that the candidate had \n35 years of experienc e supporting the ESSM program that included on- site and field \nexperience , which plainly satisfied the RFP \u2019s qualifications requirement.  Compare AR,  Page 11   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Tab 2a, RFP attach. J -2, at 8 (requiring the program manager to have 15 years of \nexperience  in \u201cmanagement of [g]overnment contract activities \u201d) with AR, Tab 8 a, PCCI \nTech. Proposal at 30 (listing proposed program manager experience as including over \n30 years of qualifying experience  supporting the ESSM program ).  Ultimately, Owl\u2019s \nprotest fails to show that the Navy \u2019s evaluation judgments in identifying and determining \nthe significance of weaknesses in PCCI \u2019s personnel under element A was \nunreasonable.   \n Under element B , management, Owl argues that the Navy unreasonably  evaluated \nPCCI \u2019s approach as superior to Owl \u2019s, both as to their transition plans and their training \nplans .  The firm challenges a weakness  the Navy assessed for the firm\u2019 s transition plan \nunder technical element B, which was based on language in Owl \u2019s proposal indicating \nthat its approach included transition functions being performed [ DELETED] .  Protest at  \n7.  Owl argues that the evaluation misinterpreted that aspect of its approach as \nrequiring staff to perform transition duties [ DELETED] .  Id.  The firm argues that its \nproposal only proposed t o have a limited set of key personnel \u201c provide limited on- site \nsupport, as necessary \u201d to supplement a dedicated transition staff.  Id.  at 36.   \nAdditionally, rather than assessing a weakness, the approach instead should have been recognized as providing value through the retention of knowledgeable incumbent personnel.  Id.\n6   \n \n6 Owl also argues that the Navy conducted misleading discussions  by identifying \nconcerns with the risks and lack of mitigation in its approach to transition.  Owl \nmaintains that it was misled to emphasize the lack of transition risks rather than address \nthe agency \u2019s concern that its approach posed a risk by overburdening its staff with \n[DELETED ] transition duties .  Owl maintains that the discussions also misled it by not \ndirecting its response to focus on providing specificity about its transition.  Protest at 7, 39; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  To be meaningful, discussions must be \nsufficiently detailed to lead an offeror to the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or revision.   Partnership for Supply Chain Mgmt. , B-411490, B -411490.2, Aug. 11, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 252 at 5 .   \nOwl fails to show that the agency \u2019s discussion inquiry was misleading; rather, the record \nshows that the agency identified a concern that the approach did not adequately identify transition risks and did not explain how areas of risk would be mitigated.   Indeed, the \nagency \u2019s discussion communication quoted from Owl \u2019s proposal regarding the \ninvolvement of [ DELETED]  in transition, and then expressed the concern that the \napproach did not give the evaluators confidence that the firm had  properly analyzed the \ntransition process from the incumbent joint venture to Owl itself being the contractor.  \nAR, Tab 3, Navy Discussions to Owl at 1- 2.  Contrary to Owl \u2019s arguments, the \ndiscussions thus reasonably led Owl to the area of the agency \u2019s evaluated concern \nabout the source of risk in its transition approach and the firm\u2019 s apparent failure to \nappreciate and mitigate the risk.  While Owl \u2019s final proposal revision failed to allay the \nconcerns raised by the agency, that outcome does not demonstrate a flaw in the agency \u2019s discussions.    Page 12   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Owl also argues that the Navy misevaluated PCCI \u2019s proposal by failing to assess \nweaknesses because PCCI did not propose incumbent key personnel, and therefore its \ntransition would necessarily involve significant risk .  Owl contends  this was confirmed \nafter award when PCCI sought information about personnel, benefits, and ongoing \norders that allegedly show the firm lacked a feasible approach to transition.  Protest \nat 7, 41-42.   \n \nOwl also challenges a weakness assessed against its proposal for  its proposed training \nplan.   Specifically, the agency identified a weakness with Owl \u2019s propos al to provide \nunderwater ships husbandry (UWSH)7 training.  T he agency concluded that Owl \u2019s plan \nreflected an overreliance on conducting training during [DELETED] .  The Navy deemed \nreliance on [ DELETED]  for training problematic because their scheduling was uncertain \nand, [DELETED] .  Owl counters that its UWSH training was multifaceted, and only one \nelement was to send personnel to \u201c receive regular training during [ DELETED] .\u201d  \nAdditionally, Owl contends that its plan provided that personnel would only be assigned to [DELETED]  if they had other duties to perform.  Protest at 4 3-45.   \n \nThe Navy argues that the evaluation under element B was reasonable and consistent \nwith the evaluation criteria.  With respect to the firms \u2019 respective transition approaches, \nthe agency argues that , contrary to Owl \u2019s description of its transition approach as \nseamless and low risk, its proposal was reasonably assessed a weakness because the \nfirm failed to appreciate and address the risk in transitioning from performance by the \nincumbent joint venture to Owl itself, notably including the approach of having \n[DELETED ].\n8  MOL at  12-15.  In contrast, the agency argues, PCCI \u2019s approach to \ntransition was detailed and insightful , and the evaluation explained in detail why the \nfirm\u2019s approach provided confidence in the firm \u2019s ability to accomplish a smooth and \nseamless transition, and thus merited a strength.   Id. at 16; AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at \n15.  The agency argues that PCCI \u2019s efforts to obtain information from Owl after award, \nas an effort to facilitate the transition,  do not support the protester \u2019s claim that PCCI \u2019s \nproposed transition plan (or, for that matter, its approach to recruiting and retaining \npersonnel) was defective.  MOL at 30.  In addition, the agency asserts  that those events \nare matters of contract administr ation rather than evidence of a flaw in the evaluation of \nPCCI \u2019s transition plan under technical element B .  Id.   \n \n \n7 In brief, UWSH involves performing ship maintenance or  repair underwater.  The \ncontract requires the contractor to maintain prepositioned equipment that is needed to \nperform UWSH tasks, so the contractor personnel who maintain that equipment and support it when deployed must receive training to ensure their s kills are current.   \n8 Owl argues that any legitimate concern about its plan to transition duties [ DELETED]  \nwas mitigated by proposing the possibility of obtaining an agreement from the \nincumbent joint venture for the key personnel to perform transition duties  [DELETED] .  \nWe see no error in the Navy \u2019s decision not to give this alternative any weight because it \nwas merely hypothetical.    Page 13   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 With respect to Owl\u2019 s UWSH training plan, the Navy argues that the evaluation \nreasonably assessed Owl \u2019s approach and determined that using [ DELETED]  \nopportunities as an element of the approach represented overreliance on an approach \nthat was uncertain and inconsistent.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 27.  To the extent Owl \nargues that the agency focused unreasonably on one element of its UWSH techniques, the agency counters that the proposal identified training during [DELETED]  as \nsignificant, stating that the f irm\u2019s \u201cUWSH mechanics receive regular training [ DELETED]  \nto qualify and stay proficient on all ESSM UWSH equipment and tools .\u201d  AR, Tab 9a, \nOwl Tech . Proposal at 85 (proposal page No. I -64).  At the same time, the evaluators \nfound that Owl \u2019s proposal did not provide detail about the significance and scope of the \nother training elements , making only brief mention of [ DELETED] , and thus the \nevaluators \u2019 assessment of a weakness was reasonable.  MOL at  20.   \n Our review of the record supports the Navy \u2019s evaluation of both weaknesses.  \nAccordingly, we deny Owl \u2019s challenges to the evaluation under element B.\n9  As \ndescribed above, the agency identified a reasonable concern about the increased risk \nresulting from  Owl\u2019s proposed transition approach, which included key personnel  \n[DELETED ].  See AR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at  117 (proposal page No.  I-96, \nstating \u201c[w]e understand that during the transition period [ DELETED] \u201d).  Although Owl \nargues that the risk was minimal and manageable, the record supports the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s evaluation of that element of the approach as a \nweakness.  The record also shows that the Navy reasonably found PCCI \u2019s transition \napproach had merit even though it did not include most of the incumbent key personnel including PCCI \u2019s identification of transition risks and mitigation strategies.   \nSimilarly, the record supports the Navy \u2019s assessment of a weakness to Owl for its \nUWSH training approach.  The evaluators reasonably understood Owl \u2019s approach as \nidentifying an essential element of its UWSH training as  occurring [DELETED] .  See \nAR, Tab 9a, Owl Tech. Proposal at 86- 87 (proposal page Nos. I -65 to I -66, explaining \nimportance of [DELETED]  experience for mechanics, identifying specific equipment \ntraining as \u201c [DELETED] ,\u201d and that salvage- specific training \u201c will typically [ DELETED] \u201d).  \nThe agency also reasonably viewed reliance presented a risk first because [DELETED] \ndid not always take place when planned, and second because it could promot e \ninefficient  expenditure of time and expense to [ DELETED] .  Accordingly, we deny Owl \u2019s \nchallenges to the evaluation under technical element B.   \n \n9 In addition to challenging its own evaluation, Owl also argues that PCCI \u2019s approach to \nUWSH should have been evaluated as inadequate and lacking detail but was instead unreasonably assessed as a strength.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The Navy refutes Owl \u2019s challenge, noting that the evaluators credited PCCI for  proposing to \nprovide training [ DELETED] , and would provide the training [ DELETED] , all of which the \nevaluators viewed as valuable.  MOL at 3 3.  Even if PCCI \u2019s UWSH approach was not \ndescribed in detail, the record supports the reasonableness of the assessment of a significant strength for PCCI \u2019s UWSH training.   Page 14   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Next, Owl challenges the evaluation under both element C, technical capability and \nexperience , and factor 2, past performance.  Owl contends that the evaluation under \nboth criteria unreasonably found that both firms had the same experience in performing \nESSM as a result of their roles in the incumbent joint venture, despite Owl \u2019s assertion \nthat it was both the majority owner of the joint venture and performed more of the work .  \nAlthough the element C evaluation concluded that Owl had a slight advantage over PCCI, Owl argues that its own role in the incumbent joint venture was much more \nsignificant than PCCI \u2019s and should have been c onsidered significantly superior.  The \nprotester alleges that PCCI did not perform many SOW requirements (such as training, \nmanagement, and specialty system procurement)  and, consequen tly, the evaluation \nshould have recognized a significant advantage for Owl over PCCI.  Protest at 65.  The protester also asserts that the Navy should have known that PCCI \u2019s claims of broad \nexperience and past performance under the incumbent contract were inaccurate, and that the evaluation was improper because it was based on alleged misrepresentations \nby PCCI.  Protest at  61-64; Comments & Supp. Protest at 32- 36.  \n The Navy argues that the evaluation of experience and capability under technical element C, and the evaluation of past performance, were both reasonable.  The Navy maintains that regardless of Owl \u2019s role in the joint venture, PCCI \u2019s proposal adequately \ndemonstrated the firm \u2019s possession of the range of experience in ESSM requirements \nand related areas.  MOL at 40- 42.  The agency notes that PCCI has been involved in \nthe incumbent joint venture for more than 30 years.  Additionally, the agency notes that in at least one area where PCCI lack ed experience and past performance on the ESSM \ncontract, it demonstrated that experience and past performance on a non- ESSM \ncontract.  Id. at 43.  The agency contends that it reasonably concluded that both firms \ndemonstrated the required capability and experience and relevant past performance, and concluded that both firms \u2019 evaluations had similar merit , and Owl \u2019s advantage \nunder the experience element was slight .   \n In response to Owl \u2019s contention that PCCI misrepresented its role in the incumbent \ncontract and thus misled the Navy with respect to the firm \u2019s experience and past \nperformance, PCCI directly disputes each of the alleged misrepresentations.  PCCI \u2019s \npresident avers that the firm participates actively in management through two members of the joint venture\u2019 s five -member board, and its executive filled the roles of chief \noperating officer (and two subordinates) until 2021, contrary to Owl \u2019s claim that the \nawardee has had little involvement in management.  Intervenor \u2019s Supp. Comments \nat 21; exh. A, Decl. of PCCI President at 1.  Further, the awardee explains that its \npersonnel often interact directly with the Navy during performance of the incumbent contract.  Id.  The firm also challenges the contention that PCCI \u2019s proposed program \nmanager has had little on- site experience during performance of the incumbent \ncontract, supporting its claim with multiple examples by the candidate of both on- site \nperformance and serv ice as the primary point of contact for specific projects.  Id.; \nexh. B, Decl. of PCCI Chief Exec. Officer at 6 -8.   \nIn a protest challenging the evaluation of experience or past performance, our Office considers the evaluation to be generally committed to the discretion of the contracting \nagency , so we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance  Page 15   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 ratings.  We will review the record to determine whether the agency conducted the \nevaluation fairly, reasonably, and in accordance with the solicitation\u2019 s evaluation \nscheme, and whether it was based on relevant information sufficient to make a \nreasonable assessment of the offeror \u2019s experience and record of performance.

To the contrary, PCCI explains that our Office has recognized experience and past performance gained by a joint venture can properly be credited to a member of the joint venture that is involved in the performance.  Intervenor \u2019s Supp. \nComments at 3 (citing  Diversified Tech. & Servs. of Virginia, Inc. , B-412090.2, \nB-412090.3, Dec . 16, 2015, 2016 CPD \u00b6 34 at 9 and Battelle Mem \u2019l Inst., B-278673, \nFeb. 27, 1998, 98- 1 CPD \u00b6 107 at 22 ).  While Owl contends that the evaluation had to \nconsider its own experience superior because of its slightly greater ownership of the joint venture (51 percent versus 49 percent)  and allegedly more comprehensive \ninvolvement in performance, the agency reasonably evaluated both and, although there were differences, the agency reasonably concluded that the difference did not \ndistinguish one above the other u nder either technical element C or the past \nperformance factor.  Nor does the record provide a basis to conclude that PCCI \nmisrepresented its experience or past performance under the incumbent contract given the firm\u2019 s direct and detailed rebuttal of the protester \u2019s allegation of misrepresentations.  \nOwl has provided no basis to sustain its challenges to those evaluations.   \n Under element D, Owl argues that the Navy misevaluated the firm \u2019s sample problem \nresponse.   The sample problem required each offeror to provide a response to a \nscenario in which a collision between a Navy ship and a barge that caused damage and evidence of leaking hydraulic fluid and heavy black oil into the water.  AR, Tab 2f, \nSample Problem at 1.   The instructions included two tentative equipment lists, and \ndirected offerors to prepare a plan to respond, that should include \u201c any \nrecommendations [the offeror] would make to equipment lists and\/or mobilization strategies with justifications for t hose recommendations.  Id. at 2.   \n Owl argues that its approach was derived from the extensive experience of its \nincumbent key personnel and should not have been assessed a weakness for a discrepancy .  Protest at 55 .  The firm argues that its sample problem response included \nthe tentative equipment list that the agency had supplied in a r equisition and \ninvoice\/ shipping document  (known as DD1149) , but also listed additional equipment \nitems separately.  Id. at 56.   The Navy assessed weakness es because of discrepancies \nin the documentation of equipment Owl proposed to utilize, and in the timing of its equipment shipments.  AR, Tab 4, SSEB Report at 33.   The firm argues that the \nassessment of weakness es was based on an unreasonable interpretation of Owl \u2019s \nsample problem respons e.   \n  Page 16   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 The Navy argues that the sample problem evaluation was reasonable.  The agency \nnotes that the sample problem was timed and was intended to assess the offeror \u2019s \nability to evaluate an emergent situation and prepare a clear plan to respond.  The discrepancy between the equipment lists showed discrepancies over the need for a \nspecific piece of equipment (a stern tube cofferdam) and the firm listed different shipping timelines  for needed equipment .  Compare AR, Tab 10, Owl Sample Problem \nResponse at 14- 17 with 19 (required equipment documentation), 22 with 24 (equipment \narrival timing); MOL at 44- 45.  The agency explains that if the sample problem had been \na real -world event, the discrepancies could interfere with efficient response to the \nsituation and could result in a needed piece of equipment failing to ship to the incident \non time.  The issue reasonably resulted in assessment of a weakness, the agency contends.  Id. at 45.   \n Based on our review of the record, the agency \u2019s technical evaluation of Owl \u2019s sample \nproblem response was reasonable.  The RFP provided that the sample problem response would be evaluated to assess the offeror \u2019s response in a problem -solving \nexercise, whether the offeror understood and would respond to the requirements of the scenario.  It advised offerors to provide comprehensive responses that address the full extent of support and field operations as if it were a real -world event.  AR, Tab 2, RFP \nat 80.  By providing equipment documentation and shipping timelines that were \ninconsistent, Owl \u2019s sample problem response was reasonably assessed a weakness.  \nIn sum, we deny all of Owl \u2019s technical factor evaluation challenges.   \nOther Cost\/Price Evaluation Challenges  \n \nUnder the cost\/price factor, apart from the challenge to the Navy \u2019s failure to properly \nevaluate professional compensation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 discussed above, \nOwl also argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider the risk posed by PCCI \u2019s \nproposal of low indirect cost rates and further, a proposed ceiling, or cap,  on its  indirect \ncost rate.  The firm argues that PCCI \u2019s approach involves  establishment of  [DELETED]  \nfor cost purposes, and that the available data of audited rates for PCCI \u2019s [DELETED]  \ncalculated [DELETED]  indirect rates than the firm proposed.   Those circumstances \nindicate a significant risk , it contends,  because by [DELETED] , PCCI will be unable to \nrecover its cost of performance under the ESSM contract .  As a result, Owl argues that \nperformance of the contract at PCCI \u2019s proposed costs will place the firm  in financial \ndistress and will incentivize the firm to minimize its efforts on the contract to lim it its \nlosses .  Owl argues that the Navy improperly failed to consider these risks in evaluating \nPCCI \u2019s cost proposal .   \n The Navy argues that its evaluation of both firms \u2019 costs proposals was consistent with \nthe evaluation criteria in the RFP .  The agency acknowledges that the RFP provided \nthat the cost evaluation would include a cost realism assessment for offeror\u2019 s indirect \nrates .  However, it encouraged offerors to propose indirect rate ceilings and further \nexplained their treatment as follows:   Page 17   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 Evaluation of Indirect Rates and Ceilings  \n \nIf the Offeror does not propose a ceiling for the indirect rates, a cost -\nrealism evaluation will be performed by the Government on the proposed indirect rates to calculate the probable cost impacts that would be incurred in the course of performance.   If proposed indirect rates are considered to \nbe unrealistic, the Offeror \u2019s proposed rates will be adjusted upward to \ndetermine the Government evaluated indirect rate .  No downward \nadjustment will be made to an Offeror \u2019s rates during the cost realism \nanalysis . \n If the Offeror proposes a ceiling for any indirect rates, the evaluated rate(s) will be equal to the proposed ceiling rate as this ceiling rate represents the maximum cost risk to the Government and is therefore considered realistic .  \n RFP at 113  (\u00a7 M, 2.3.1.2). \n The Navy argues that since both offerors proposed caps on all indirect costs, the Navy \nproperly calculated each firm \u2019s costs by using the capped rates and deem ing the firm\u2019s \ncapped rates to be realistic .  The Navy maintains that the evaluation was consistent with \nthe RFP, and that the evaluation of risk from PCCI \u2019s allegedly low indirect rates and \nceilings, that Owl argues  for, was not required under the term s of the RFP .   \n As a general principle, the FAR provides that when evaluating offerors \u2019 costs for a \ncost-reimbursement contract, the agency must assess the realism of the offeror \u2019s \nproposed costs; that is, a cost realism analysis .  FAR 15 .404-1.  The requirement to \nassess cost realism is to recognize that the offeror \u2019s proposed costs are not dispositive \nin a cost -reimbursement environment ; that is, even if the offeror proposes that its costs \nwill be low, the government generally will be liable to the contractor for all allowable and \nallocable costs incurred in connection with the performance of the contract .  Vectrus \nMission Sols . Corp .; Vanquish Worldwide, LLC , B-418942 et al., Oct . 27, 2020, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 87 at 5 .  The analysis involves   \n \nindependently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror \u2019s \nproposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials descri bed in the offeror \u2019s technical \nproposal . \n FAR 15 .404-1(d)(1) .   \n Here, t he record does not show a basis to sustain Owl \u2019s challenges to the evaluation of \nPCCI \u2019s costs,  even if its proposal included indirect cost caps  that turn out to be far \nbelow the costs that PCCI will actually incur  during performance.   While a cost realism  Page 18   B-423281 ; B-423281 .2 analysis may provide a basis to consider the risk posed by an offeror proposing cost \ncaps that could create incentives for minimal or poor performance, the RFP here \nexpressly provided that the Navy would consider proposed indirect cost caps to be \nrealistic , hence, without regard to the cap level or the potential effects, such as an \nofferor \u2019s potential financial losses or distorted performance incentives .  Accordingly , the \nagency \u2019s treatment of PCCI\u2019 s capped indirect rates as realistic (and likewise for Owl10) \nwas consistent with the RFP .  Accordingly, we deny the protest er\u2019s challenges to the \nevaluation under the cost\/price factor .   \n Tradeoff  \n Finally, although Owl challenges the reasonableness of the Navy \u2019s tradeoff  and \nselection of PCCI \u2019s proposal, we do not reach the merits of these challenges because \nwe conclude that without properly evaluating the offerors \u2019 professional compensation as \nthe RFP provided, the Navy could not reasonably select PCCI \u2019s proposal as the best \nvalue.  Accordingly, we sustain the challenge to the agency\u2019s tradeoff .   \n RECOMMENDATION  We recommend that the Navy reevaluate offerors \u2019 proposals in accordance with the \nRFP, and in particular FAR provision 52.222- 46.  If the Navy \u2019s evaluation reasonably \ndetermines that an offeror \u2019s professional compensation is unrealistically low , the Navy \nshould consider whether the circumstances justify rejecting the proposal, pursuant to \nFAR provision 52.222- 46(d).   The Navy may consider reopening discussions if the Navy \ndetermines that obtaining more information would be in the agency\u2019s interest.   We \nfurther recommend that the Navy make a new source selection determination and, if \nPCCI is not selected for award, we recommend that the agency terminate the award to PCCI for the convenience of the government and make a new award, if otherwise \nproper.  Finally, we recommend that the agency reimburse Owl\u2019 s costs associated with \nfiling and pursuing these protests, including reasonable attorneys \u2019 fees.  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.8(d)(1).  Owl should submit its certified claim for costs, detailing the time expended \nand costs incurred, directly to the contracting agency within 60 days after the receipt of \nthis decision.   \n \nThe protest is sustained in part and denied in part .   \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n10 Owl notes that the Navy assessed the realism of Owl \u2019s proposal of a [ DELETED]  \npercent overhead rate for certain costs .  Comments & Supp.  Protest at 39.   However, as \nOwl also acknowledges, the Navy determined that Owl \u2019s approach was proper , so the \nfirm was not prejudiced by that allegedly improper realism assessment .   "

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the agency\u2019s award of a contract and the rejection of the protester\u2019s quotation by the agency\u2019s server is dismissed where the protest was filed more than 10 days after the protester knew or should have known the basis for its protest.  \nDECISION  \n A2A Integrated Logistics, Inc. , a service -disabled veteran- owned small business  of \nFayetteville, North Carolina , protests  the award of a contract  under request for \nquotations (RFQ)  No. 36C24425Q0297, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs  \n(VA), for media systems and hardware, digitizing\/document scanning software licenses , \nand onsite training services for  the VA Wilkes -Barre Medical Center  in Wilkes -Barre, \nPennsylvania.  The protester contends that its quotation represented the best value to the agency.  The protester also contends  that the agency\u2019s server improperly rejected \nits quotation.   \n We dismiss the protest because prior to protesting to our Office, the protester filed an agency -level protest and that protest was not timely filed.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or  delaying \nthe procurement process.

Under these rules, a protest based on alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed prior to bid opening or the time established for r eceipt of \nproposals, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1), and all other protests must be filed no later than 10 \ncalendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, Page 2                                                                                                                                        B-423433   whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  Further, a matter initially protested to the \ncontracting agency will be considered timely by our Office only if the initial agency \nprotest was filed within the time limits provided by the Regulations for filing a protest with our Of fice unless the contracting agency imposes a more stringent time for filing, in \nwhich case the agency\u2019s time for filing will control.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(3).   \n As relevant here, the solicitation  provided that the closing date for quotations was  \nFebruary 10, 2025; the agency announced award on February 19.

Concerning the challenge \nto the award of the contract , we dismiss this argument  as untimely because the \nprotester challenged the award more than 10 calendar days after it knew, or should \nhave known, of the basis for protest.  In this regard, the agency made award on \nFebruary 19;  the protester , however, did not formally challenge the award until it filed its  \nagency -level protest on  March 12.  Req. for Dismissal at  2.  Accordingly, the protest \nground is untimely . \n We also dismiss as untimely the protester\u2019s argument that the agency\u2019s server \nimproperly rejected its quotation.  The protester objects to dismissal on the basis that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of response made it impossible to follow dispute protocols.\u201d  Resp. to \nReq. for Dismissal at 2.

According to the protester,  its agency -level protest  was timely because it \nwas filed within 10 days of the agency\u2019s response on March 12.

In this regard, a firm\u2019s attempt  to address  its concerns  with the contracting \nofficer  prior to filing an agency -level protest  does not extend the time for filing an \nagency -level protest.

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the scope of agency corrective action taken in response to the \nprotester\u2019s prior protest  is denied where the agency reasonably limited the scope of \ndiscussions to address only the issues that led the agency to take corrective action. \nDECISION  \n The Mission Essential Group, LLC, of New Albany, Ohio, protests the scope of the agency\u2019s corrective action following its prior protest of the award of a contract to Worldwide Language Resources, LLC (WWLR), of Fayetteville, North Carolina, under request for proposals (RFP) No. H92402- 23-R-0002, issued by the United States \nSpecial Operations Command for linguist support services.  The protester alleges that the agency\u2019s proposed corrective action is both unreasonable and unfairly benefits WWLR.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n The RFP was initially issued on April 3, 2023, and contemplated the award of a single indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity contract with a 5- year ordering period.  Contracting \nOfficer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 2.  The solicitation included a preliminary fac tor--general \nadministrative and qualifying criteria--to be evaluated on a pass\/fail basis.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 7, RFP at 198.  Proposals that failed the initial factor were not DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-421745.4  evaluated further.  Id.  The solicitation then contemplated a best -value tradeoff among \nfour additional factors:  (1) transition plan; (2) management plan; (3) past performance; \nand (4) price.  Id. \n Five proposals were received by the original proposal due date in May of 2023.  COS at 3.  Four of those proposals received a pass rating for the preliminary factor, but \nultimately only three proposals were selected for inclusion in the competitive range:  Mission Essential, WWLR, and SOS International LLC (SOSi).\n1  Id. at 4.  The agency \nthen issued evaluation notices (ENs) to all three remaining offerors and solicited final proposal revisions on February 9, 2024.  Id.   On May 10, the agency concluded that \nWWLR\u2019s proposal represented the best value to the government and made award to WWLR.  Id.  Following a debriefing, Mission Essential filed a protest with our Office \nchallenging the award to WWLR on several grounds, and subsequently filed a \nsupplemental protest that included an allegation that WWLR\u2019s management plan should \nhave been assessed a deficiency because its small business subcontracting plan did not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  Id. at 5.  The agency elected to \ntake corrective action committing to reevaluate proposals and take other corrective \naction as appropriate, and we dismissed the protest as academic.  AR, Tab 25, Notice \nof Corrective Action; The Mission Essential Group, LLC , B-421745.2, B -421745.3, Aug. \n19, 2024 (unpublished decision).  \n \nSubsequently, the agency reevaluated proposals and issued a new set of ENs to each \nof the three offerors.  COS at 6 -7.  However, the agency limited the scope of proposal \nrevisions to the scope of the issues identified in the ENs as well as any other portions of \nthe proposal materially impacted by revisions necessary to address the ENs.  See , e.g., \nAR, Tab 32, Request for Final Proposal Revisions to Mission Essential at 1.  This \nprotest followed.  \n \nDISCUSSION  \nThe protester raises two primary  challenges to the scope of the agency\u2019s corrective \naction.  Protest at 30- 37.  First, the protester alleges that the agency has improperly \nlimited proposal revisions in a way that is impermissible, unequal, and unfair, primarily \nbecause the agency has limited offerors to revising only those portions of their \nproposals identified in t he ENs and the ENs  differ between offerors , thus allowing \nofferors unique opportunities to revise their respective proposals .  Id.  Second, the \nprotester contends that the agency\u2019s discussions with the protester were not meaningful \n \n1 Mission Essential was initially excluded from the competitive range due to concerns \nabout its disclosure of certain changes to its corporate structure not at issue in this \nprotest.  Mission Essential filed a protest of that exclusion with our Office, and the agency subsequently took voluntary corrective action to include Mission Essential in the competitive range.  The Mission Essential Group, LLC , B-421745, Sept. 7, 2023 \n(unpublished decision).   Page 3 B-421745.4  because the agency failed to raise the significant price difference  between the protester \nand other offerors.2  Id. \n \nTurning to the protester\u2019s first argument, the protester objects that the agency has limited proposal revisions to the evaluation notices issued to each offeror.  Comments \nat 5-10.  This is unfair, the protester contends, because each offeror\u2019s potential \nrevision s are limited differently.  Id.  That is, all offerors will be permitted to revise their \nprice proposals, but each offeror is  limited to revising different aspects of their  \nrespective price proposal s based on the specific issues the agency identified in each \nevaluation notice.  Id.   Moreover, the protester notes that WWLR, and only WWLR, is \nbeing permitted to revise its management proposal, and the protester alleges that the nature of those changes could permit sweeping revisions to WWLR\u2019s proposal.   Id. \n Generally, in responding to discussions, offerors may revise any aspect of their proposals as they see fit --including aspects that were not the subject of discussions.  \nRel-Tek Sys. & Design, Inc. --Modification of Remedy , B-280463.7, July 1, 1999, \n99-2 CPD \u00b6 1 at 3.   We have concluded, however, that  an agency, in conducting \ndiscussions to implement corrective action,  may reasonably decide to limit the revisions \nofferors may make to their proposals.   Id.  As a general matter, the details of \nimplementing corr ective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the \ncontracting agency, and we will not object to any particular corrective action, so long as it is appropriate to remedy the concern that caused the agency to take corrective \n \n2 The protester raises additional arguments not addressed in this decision.  W e have \nreviewed all of the protester\u2019s  arguments and conclude that none of them provide a \nbasis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, the protester argues that the \nagency\u2019s proposed corrective action violates the Federal Acquisition Regulation\u2019s (FAR)  \nrequirement that all offerors have a common cutoff for submission of proposal revisions because offerors are being permitted to revise different proposal volumes , effectively \ncreating different cutoff  dates  for final proposal submission for the revisions to those \nvolumes.  Comments at 11- 12 (citing  FAR 15.307(b) ).  We do not agree.   \nWhile the protester identifies a decision in which we concluded that an agency\u2019s approach to proposal revisions during corrective action was inappropriate because it failed to create a common cutoff for proposal submission, that case is inapposite.  See  \nRaytheon Tech. Servs. Co., LLC , B-404655.4 et al. , Oct. 11, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 236.  In \nRaytheon, the agency took corrective action that involved permitting two offerors that were originally excluded from the competitive range to enter the competitive range and submit revised proposals without limitation, but without permitting the original offerors in the competitive range the opportunity to further revise their proposals.  Id.  at 7-8.  As a \nresult, different offerors had different periods of time for revising the entirety of their proposals and different cutoff dates for submission, which we concluded violated the FAR\u2019s requirement for a common cutoff for final proposal revisions.  Id.  Those are not \nthe facts present here--in this case, all offerors have been permitted to make proposal revisions and given a common cutoff date for submission.  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest on this basis.   Page 4 B-421745.4  action.   MSC Indus. Direct Co., Inc., B -411533.2, B -411533.4, Oct. 9, 2015, 2015 CPD \n\u00b6 316 at 5.    \n \nTurning first to the price ENs,  while the protester is correct that the ENs  concerning \nprice proposals differ between the offerors, we do not believe that the protester can establish competitive prejudice with regard to these ENs .  Competitive prejudice is an \nessential element of every viable protest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, \nMar. 31, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 79 at 3.  Our Office will not sustain a protest unless the \nprotester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s  \nactions. CSI Aviation, Inc. , B-415631 et al. , Feb. 7, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 68 at 7.    \n In this regard, the agency issued five price ENs, two to Mission Essential , two to \nWWLR, and one to SOSi .  Of note, each of the three offerors received one price EN \nasking for clarification concerning inconsistencies between their respective price workbook entries and transition plans addressing essentially similar proposal faults.  See, AR, Tabs 33, 37, and 41.  Because these three price ENs were similar in scope for \nall three offerors,  those ENs cannot represent a source of competitive prejudice.   \n Accordingly, the only potential avenue for competitive prejudice regarding the price ENs relates to the two remaining price ENs that differed between the offerors, one of which was issued to Mission Essential and the other to WWLR.  However,  as an initial matter, \nwe have explained that although discussions may not be conducted in a manner that favors one offeror over another, discussions are not required to be identical among offerors and need only be tailored to each offeror\u2019s proposal.  Second Street Hold ings, \nLLC et al. , B-417006.4 et al. , Jan. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 33 at 27.  Further, here we \nnote that, while the protester is correct that the two ENs differ, the protester\u2019s EN was \nsignificantly broader in scope than WWLR\u2019s EN  potentially providing the protester with a \ngreater opportunity than provided to other offerors to expand on its response to this EN . \n Specifically, WWLR\u2019s second price EN noted that WWLR\u2019s subcontractors proposed a \nspecific fringe rate that was lower than their historical rates .  The agency  asked WWLR \nto provide an explanation for how providing a fringe rate for each subcontractor lower than the firm\u2019s historical fringe rates does not adversely impact each company\u2019s ability \nto recruit and retain qualified personnel.  AR, Tab 42, WWLR Price EN R1 at 1.  That is, the agency asked for  additional explanatory narrative concerning WWLR\u2019s existi ng \nsubcontractor price and fringe rate narrative.  Id.  \n By contrast, the protester\u2019s second price EN explained that none of the protester\u2019s subcontractors provided a price narrative or explanation of fringe benefits  at all, and the \nEN asked the protester to provide price narratives including specific fringe benefit  \ninformation for its subcontractors.  AR, Tab 34, Mission Essential Price EN R1 at 2.  Significantly, the protester\u2019s EN is expansive enough that the protester could provide precisely the type of narrow revisions that WWLR is being permitted to make \n(justifications of its subcontractor fringe rates) in addition to other significant categories \nof revisions ( fully revising its absent subcontractor price narratives and fringe benefit \nexplanations ).  Id.  That is, the protester\u2019s EN is much broader in scope because it fully  Page 5 B-421745.4  encompasses the scope of WWLR\u2019s EN and extends beyond it .  Moreover, we note that \nthe third offeror, SOSi, was given no opportunity to amend this aspect of its price \nproposal.  Therefore, while the protester is correct that these ENs differ between the offerors, we see no reasonable basis to conclude that the protester was competitively prejudiced by these differences because the protester received the most expansive set of oppor tunities for revision of its price proposal among the three offerors.  \n Turning to the management plan EN  addressed to WWLR , we likewise see no basis to \nsustain the protest.  Here, the EN raised a concern that WWLR\u2019s proposal was \ninternally inconsistent in a way that represented a deficiency.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR \nManagement EN D1 at 1- 2.  Specifically, the solicitation required that offerors allocate a \nminimum of 3 percent of contract dollars to woman- owned small businesses (WOSBs).  \nRFP at 187.  However, while one table included in WWLR\u2019s management plan indicated that WWLR  would allocate [DELETED]  percent of contract dollars to WOSBs, \nexceeding the minimum required subcontracting targets for WOSBs by [DELETED]  \npercent, a second table indicated that WWLR would only allocate [DELETED]  percent to \nWOSBs, falling [DELETED]  percent short of the minimum subcontracting requirements.  \nCompare AR, Tab 21g, WWLR Feb. 2024 Management Plan Volume at 37 (Figure 13 \nshowing [DELETED]  percent of contract value for WOSBs) with Id.  at 39 (Figure 14 \nshowing [DELETED]  percent of contract value for  WOSBs).  Moreover, the proposal \nwas similarly inconsistent concerning the amount of contract dollars allocated to veteran- owned small businesses --for which the solicitation included no minimum target .  \nId.  Specifically, WWLR\u2019s proposal  indicat ed that WWLR would allocate [DELETED]  \npercent to veteran- owned small businesses in the first table but allocated [DELETED]  \npercent in the second table.  Id.   The agency\u2019s EN noted those discrepancies and \npermitted WWLR to revise its management plan to resolve the iss ue.  See  AR, Tab 40, \nWWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2. \n Crucially, that identical inconsistency was present in WWLR\u2019s initial proposal  submitted \nin May 12, 2023.  See  B-21745.2 AR, Tab 59s, WWLR May 2023 Management Plan \nVolume at 32 and 34.  However, t he agency did not identify this deficiency or raise it in \ndiscussions with WWLR.  A gencies are required to raise all deficiencies or significant \nweaknesses in discussions, and as a result, the agency\u2019s discussions with WWLR were not meaningful because they did not raise this deficiency.   See , e.g., Mission Essential \nPersonnel, LLC , B-407474, B -407493, Jan. 7, 2013, 2013 CPD \u00b6 22 at 5 (discussions, \nwhen conducted, must be meaningful --that is, they must identify deficiencies and \nsignificant weaknesses that exist in an offeror\u2019s proposal).  Moreover, we will sustain a \nprotest when the record shows that, although an agency held discussions, it failed to raise a deficiency that was present in an offeror\u2019s initial proposal .  Id.  Here, t he \nagency\u2019s proposed corrective action to permit WWLR to resolve this deficiency is reasonable because it will correct the agency\u2019s earlier error in failing to raise this point in discussions with WWLR.   \n Moreover, while the protester complains that it is not similarly allowed to revise its management plan, and the agency is, in effect, holding discussions with only WWLR concerning the management plan proposal volume, we likewise see no merit in that  Page 6 B-421745.4  objection.  In this regard, w e have specifically concluded that when reopening \ndiscussions during corrective action to address a fault in a proposal that the a gency \nimproperly failed to raise in discussions, an agency may reasonably limit the scope of \ndiscussions and go so far as to hold discussions with only the affected \nofferor.   Environmental Chem. Corp. , B-416166.3 et al. , June 12, 2019, 2019 CPD \n\u00b6 217 at 20- 21 (corrective action proposing to hold discussions with only one offeror \nwas reasonable where t he discussions and proposal revisions were limited solely to \naddressing a fault in offeror\u2019s proposal that should have been raised in earlier discussions).    \n In this same vein, as explained above, the contours of agency corrective action are within its discretion provided the corrective action is designed to remedy the errors identified with a procurement.  Here, the parties do not dispute that the errors with the agency\u2019s underlying evaluation necessitate reopening discussions.  Although the protester challenges the agency\u2019s decision to tailor the scope of discussion responses and proposal revisions to match the areas of reopened discussions for each offeror, w e \nsee no reason why the agency would be required to revisit those portions of the offerors proposals and its evaluation that were untainted by the underlying procurement errors.  An agency\u2019s correction of procurement errors does not per se require the agency to \nembark on what would amount to an entirely new competition.  \n In short,  the agency was obligated to allow WWLR to revise this aspect of its \nmanagement plan, and its approach is appropriate to resolve that concern.   In this \nregard, WWLR will only be placed in the same competitive position that the other offerors, including the protester, were in following their receipt of meaningful \ndiscussions.   The protester does not allege that its own management plan contains a \nsimilar unaddressed deficiency, and accordingly, we see no basis to conclude that the agency was under any obligation to permit other offerors to revise their management plans on these facts.\n3    \n Meaningful Discussions  \n Next the protester argues that the agency failed to engage in equal or meaningful discussions with the protester.  Comments at 12- 15.  Specifically, the protester argues \nthat the agency went beyond the minimum requirements of the FAR by not limiting discus sions to deficiencies or significant weaknesses, but instead identified other \naspects of the protester\u2019s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance \n \n3 While it is not dispositive to our analysis, we also note that the nature of the issues \nraised by the management plan EN and WWLR\u2019s proposed response were both relatively minor in scope.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2.  \nSpecifically, WWLR represented that this inconsistency was an administrative error and that it would amend the second table to move the additional [DELETED] percent from \nveteran owned small businesses to WOSBs so that the second table would match exactly what WWLR proposed in the first table in its management plan.  Id.   In essence, \nWWLR proposed to conform its proposal to correct what amounted to a clerical error.    Page 7 B-421745.4  materially  the protester\u2019s potential for award.  Id.  However, the protester argues that the \nagency did not raise all such areas in the protester\u2019s proposal, falsely leading the \nprotester to believe that the agency had no concerns about areas that it did not raise.  Id.  Specifically, the protester notes that its price is approximately $50 million (or \n34 percent) higher than the next lowest -priced offeror, but the agency did not call that \nout in its initial discussions and has not now provided the protester  with an opportunity \nto revisit its price.  Id. \n In response, the agency notes that during the corrective action reevaluation, the agency identified no deficiencies or significant weaknesses in the protester\u2019s proposal, but did issue the price ENs discussed above to identify areas the protester could rev ise to \nimprove its potential for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 18 -19.  The agency \nnotes that the FAR encourages contracting officers to discuss other aspects of the offeror\u2019s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance materially the \npropos al\u2019s potential for award, but expressly notes that t he contracting officer is not \nrequired to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved.   Id. at 17.  \nAccordingly, the agency  contends that these discussions are meaningful and not \nmisleading, and exceeded the minimum requirements established by the FAR.  Id.  \nat 19.   \n Discussions must, at a minimum, address significant weaknesses, deficiencies and \nadverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond.  FAR 15.306(d)(3); American States Utilities Servs., Inc. , \nB-291307.3, June 30, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 150 at 6 .  Moreover, while issues pertaining to \nprice are within the ambit of discussions these issues are treated distinctly from \nsignificant weaknesses and deficiencies in the non- price proposal.  See e.g. , FAR  \n15.306(d) (discussions may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract) .  In this regard, contracting officers are \nspecifically given the discretion, rather than charged with the obligation, to discuss \nwhether an offeror\u2019s price is considered to be too high or too low.  FAR 15.306(e)(3); \nsee also Theodor Wille Intertrade AG , B-409976.3, Jan. 22, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 65 at 4 \n(discussing the discretion given to contracting officers with respect to discussions related to price).   \n In short, on the facts present here, where the agency did not conclude that the protester\u2019s price is unreasonably high and the agency has not otherwise raised comparative price with other offerors, our decisions are clear that a contracting officer is not obligated to raise the fact that an offeror\u2019s price is higher than other offerors in \ndiscussions.   See, e.g., NOVA Dine, LLC , B-420454, B -420454.2, Apr. 15, 2022, \n2022 CPD \u00b6 101 at 6 (\u201c[T]here is no requirement for an agency to inform an offeror \nduring dis cussions that its price may be too high, where the offeror\u2019s price is not \nconsidered excessive or unreasonable\u201d); SOC LLC,  B-419977,  B-419977.2, Oct. 15, \n2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 370 (notwithstanding the fact that the agency engaged in wide-ranging discussions and included several other discussion questions concerning price,   Page 8 B-421745.4  the agency was not required to raise the fact that the protester\u2019s price was higher than \nother offerors\u2019 prices because the protester\u2019s price was not unreasonably high).

Page 3 B-421745.4  because the agency failed to raise the significant price difference  between the protester \nand other offerors.2  Id. \n \nTurning to the protester\u2019s first argument, the protester objects that the agency has limited proposal revisions to the evaluation notices issued to each offeror.  Comments \nat 5-10.  This is unfair, the protester contends, because each offeror\u2019s potential \nrevision s are limited differently.  Id.  That is, all offerors will be permitted to revise their \nprice proposals, but each offeror is  limited to revising different aspects of their  \nrespective price proposal s based on the specific issues the agency identified in each \nevaluation notice.  Id.   Moreover, the protester notes that WWLR, and only WWLR, is \nbeing permitted to revise its management proposal, and the protester alleges that the nature of those changes could permit sweeping revisions to WWLR\u2019s proposal.   Id. \n Generally, in responding to discussions, offerors may revise any aspect of their proposals as they see fit --including aspects that were not the subject of discussions.  \nRel-Tek Sys. & Design, Inc. --Modification of Remedy , B-280463.7, July 1, 1999, \n99-2 CPD \u00b6 1 at 3.   We have concluded, however, that  an agency, in conducting \ndiscussions to implement corrective action,  may reasonably decide to limit the revisions \nofferors may make to their proposals.   Id.  As a general matter, the details of \nimplementing corr ective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the \ncontracting agency, and we will not object to any particular corrective action, so long as it is appropriate to remedy the concern that caused the agency to take corrective \n \n2 The protester raises additional arguments not addressed in this decision.  W e have \nreviewed all of the protester\u2019s  arguments and conclude that none of them provide a \nbasis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, the protester argues that the \nagency\u2019s proposed corrective action violates the Federal Acquisition Regulation\u2019s (FAR)  \nrequirement that all offerors have a common cutoff for submission of proposal revisions because offerors are being permitted to revise different proposal volumes , effectively \ncreating different cutoff  dates  for final proposal submission for the revisions to those \nvolumes.  Comments at 11- 12 (citing  FAR 15.307(b) ).  We do not agree.   \nWhile the protester identifies a decision in which we concluded that an agency\u2019s approach to proposal revisions during corrective action was inappropriate because it failed to create a common cutoff for proposal submission, that case is inapposite.  See  \nRaytheon Tech. Servs. Co., LLC , B-404655.4 et al. , Oct. 11, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 236.  In \nRaytheon, the agency took corrective action that involved permitting two offerors that were originally excluded from the competitive range to enter the competitive range and submit revised proposals without limitation, but without permitting the original offerors in the competitive range the opportunity to further revise their proposals.  Id.  at 7-8.  As a \nresult, different offerors had different periods of time for revising the entirety of their proposals and different cutoff dates for submission, which we concluded violated the FAR\u2019s requirement for a common cutoff for final proposal revisions.  Id.  Those are not \nthe facts present here--in this case, all offerors have been permitted to make proposal revisions and given a common cutoff date for submission.  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest on this basis.   Page 4 B-421745.4  action.   MSC Indus.

Competitive prejudice is an \nessential element of every viable protest.  Armorworks Enters., LLC , B-400394.3, \nMar. 31, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 79 at 3.  Our Office will not sustain a protest unless the \nprotester demonstrates a reasonable possibility that it was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s  \nactions. CSI Aviation, Inc. , B-415631 et al. , Feb. 7, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 68 at 7.    \n In this regard, the agency issued five price ENs, two to Mission Essential , two to \nWWLR, and one to SOSi .  Of note, each of the three offerors received one price EN \nasking for clarification concerning inconsistencies between their respective price workbook entries and transition plans addressing essentially similar proposal faults.  See, AR, Tabs 33, 37, and 41.  Because these three price ENs were similar in scope for \nall three offerors,  those ENs cannot represent a source of competitive prejudice.   \n Accordingly, the only potential avenue for competitive prejudice regarding the price ENs relates to the two remaining price ENs that differed between the offerors, one of which was issued to Mission Essential and the other to WWLR.  However,  as an initial matter, \nwe have explained that although discussions may not be conducted in a manner that favors one offeror over another, discussions are not required to be identical among offerors and need only be tailored to each offeror\u2019s proposal.  Second Street Hold ings, \nLLC et al. , B-417006.4 et al. , Jan. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 33 at 27.  Further, here we \nnote that, while the protester is correct that the two ENs differ, the protester\u2019s EN was \nsignificantly broader in scope than WWLR\u2019s EN  potentially providing the protester with a \ngreater opportunity than provided to other offerors to expand on its response to this EN . \n Specifically, WWLR\u2019s second price EN noted that WWLR\u2019s subcontractors proposed a \nspecific fringe rate that was lower than their historical rates .  The agency  asked WWLR \nto provide an explanation for how providing a fringe rate for each subcontractor lower than the firm\u2019s historical fringe rates does not adversely impact each company\u2019s ability \nto recruit and retain qualified personnel.  AR, Tab 42, WWLR Price EN R1 at 1.  That is, the agency asked for  additional explanatory narrative concerning WWLR\u2019s existi ng \nsubcontractor price and fringe rate narrative.  Id.  \n By contrast, the protester\u2019s second price EN explained that none of the protester\u2019s subcontractors provided a price narrative or explanation of fringe benefits  at all, and the \nEN asked the protester to provide price narratives including specific fringe benefit  \ninformation for its subcontractors.  AR, Tab 34, Mission Essential Price EN R1 at 2.  Significantly, the protester\u2019s EN is expansive enough that the protester could provide precisely the type of narrow revisions that WWLR is being permitted to make \n(justifications of its subcontractor fringe rates) in addition to other significant categories \nof revisions ( fully revising its absent subcontractor price narratives and fringe benefit \nexplanations ).  Id.  That is, the protester\u2019s EN is much broader in scope because it fully  Page 5 B-421745.4  encompasses the scope of WWLR\u2019s EN and extends beyond it .  Moreover, we note that \nthe third offeror, SOSi, was given no opportunity to amend this aspect of its price \nproposal.  Therefore, while the protester is correct that these ENs differ between the offerors, we see no reasonable basis to conclude that the protester was competitively prejudiced by these differences because the protester received the most expansive set of oppor tunities for revision of its price proposal among the three offerors.  \n Turning to the management plan EN  addressed to WWLR , we likewise see no basis to \nsustain the protest.  Here, the EN raised a concern that WWLR\u2019s proposal was \ninternally inconsistent in a way that represented a deficiency.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR \nManagement EN D1 at 1- 2.  Specifically, the solicitation required that offerors allocate a \nminimum of 3 percent of contract dollars to woman- owned small businesses (WOSBs).  \nRFP at 187.  However, while one table included in WWLR\u2019s management plan indicated that WWLR  would allocate [DELETED]  percent of contract dollars to WOSBs, \nexceeding the minimum required subcontracting targets for WOSBs by [DELETED]  \npercent, a second table indicated that WWLR would only allocate [DELETED]  percent to \nWOSBs, falling [DELETED]  percent short of the minimum subcontracting requirements.  \nCompare AR, Tab 21g, WWLR Feb. 2024 Management Plan Volume at 37 (Figure 13 \nshowing [DELETED]  percent of contract value for WOSBs) with Id.  at 39 (Figure 14 \nshowing [DELETED]  percent of contract value for  WOSBs).  Moreover, the proposal \nwas similarly inconsistent concerning the amount of contract dollars allocated to veteran- owned small businesses --for which the solicitation included no minimum target .  \nId.  Specifically, WWLR\u2019s proposal  indicat ed that WWLR would allocate [DELETED]  \npercent to veteran- owned small businesses in the first table but allocated [DELETED]  \npercent in the second table.  Id.   The agency\u2019s EN noted those discrepancies and \npermitted WWLR to revise its management plan to resolve the iss ue.  See  AR, Tab 40, \nWWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2. \n Crucially, that identical inconsistency was present in WWLR\u2019s initial proposal  submitted \nin May 12, 2023.  See  B-21745.2 AR, Tab 59s, WWLR May 2023 Management Plan \nVolume at 32 and 34.  However, t he agency did not identify this deficiency or raise it in \ndiscussions with WWLR.  A gencies are required to raise all deficiencies or significant \nweaknesses in discussions, and as a result, the agency\u2019s discussions with WWLR were not meaningful because they did not raise this deficiency.   See , e.g., Mission Essential \nPersonnel, LLC , B-407474, B -407493, Jan. 7, 2013, 2013 CPD \u00b6 22 at 5 (discussions, \nwhen conducted, must be meaningful --that is, they must identify deficiencies and \nsignificant weaknesses that exist in an offeror\u2019s proposal).  Moreover, we will sustain a \nprotest when the record shows that, although an agency held discussions, it failed to raise a deficiency that was present in an offeror\u2019s initial proposal .  Id.  Here, t he \nagency\u2019s proposed corrective action to permit WWLR to resolve this deficiency is reasonable because it will correct the agency\u2019s earlier error in failing to raise this point in discussions with WWLR.   \n Moreover, while the protester complains that it is not similarly allowed to revise its management plan, and the agency is, in effect, holding discussions with only WWLR concerning the management plan proposal volume, we likewise see no merit in that  Page 6 B-421745.4  objection.  In this regard, w e have specifically concluded that when reopening \ndiscussions during corrective action to address a fault in a proposal that the a gency \nimproperly failed to raise in discussions, an agency may reasonably limit the scope of \ndiscussions and go so far as to hold discussions with only the affected \nofferor.   Environmental Chem. Corp. , B-416166.3 et al. , June 12, 2019, 2019 CPD \n\u00b6 217 at 20- 21 (corrective action proposing to hold discussions with only one offeror \nwas reasonable where t he discussions and proposal revisions were limited solely to \naddressing a fault in offeror\u2019s proposal that should have been raised in earlier discussions).    \n In this same vein, as explained above, the contours of agency corrective action are within its discretion provided the corrective action is designed to remedy the errors identified with a procurement.  Here, the parties do not dispute that the errors with the agency\u2019s underlying evaluation necessitate reopening discussions.  Although the protester challenges the agency\u2019s decision to tailor the scope of discussion responses and proposal revisions to match the areas of reopened discussions for each offeror, w e \nsee no reason why the agency would be required to revisit those portions of the offerors proposals and its evaluation that were untainted by the underlying procurement errors.  An agency\u2019s correction of procurement errors does not per se require the agency to \nembark on what would amount to an entirely new competition.  \n In short,  the agency was obligated to allow WWLR to revise this aspect of its \nmanagement plan, and its approach is appropriate to resolve that concern.   In this \nregard, WWLR will only be placed in the same competitive position that the other offerors, including the protester, were in following their receipt of meaningful \ndiscussions.   The protester does not allege that its own management plan contains a \nsimilar unaddressed deficiency, and accordingly, we see no basis to conclude that the agency was under any obligation to permit other offerors to revise their management plans on these facts.\n3    \n Meaningful Discussions  \n Next the protester argues that the agency failed to engage in equal or meaningful discussions with the protester.  Comments at 12- 15.  Specifically, the protester argues \nthat the agency went beyond the minimum requirements of the FAR by not limiting discus sions to deficiencies or significant weaknesses, but instead identified other \naspects of the protester\u2019s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance \n \n3 While it is not dispositive to our analysis, we also note that the nature of the issues \nraised by the management plan EN and WWLR\u2019s proposed response were both relatively minor in scope.  See  AR, Tab 40, WWLR Management EN D1 at 1- 2.  \nSpecifically, WWLR represented that this inconsistency was an administrative error and that it would amend the second table to move the additional [DELETED] percent from \nveteran owned small businesses to WOSBs so that the second table would match exactly what WWLR proposed in the first table in its management plan.  Id.   In essence, \nWWLR proposed to conform its proposal to correct what amounted to a clerical error.    Page 7 B-421745.4  materially  the protester\u2019s potential for award.  Id.  However, the protester argues that the \nagency did not raise all such areas in the protester\u2019s proposal, falsely leading the \nprotester to believe that the agency had no concerns about areas that it did not raise.  Id.  Specifically, the protester notes that its price is approximately $50 million (or \n34 percent) higher than the next lowest -priced offeror, but the agency did not call that \nout in its initial discussions and has not now provided the protester  with an opportunity \nto revisit its price.  Id. \n In response, the agency notes that during the corrective action reevaluation, the agency identified no deficiencies or significant weaknesses in the protester\u2019s proposal, but did issue the price ENs discussed above to identify areas the protester could rev ise to \nimprove its potential for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 18 -19.  The agency \nnotes that the FAR encourages contracting officers to discuss other aspects of the offeror\u2019s proposal that could be altered or explained to enhance materially the \npropos al\u2019s potential for award, but expressly notes that t he contracting officer is not \nrequired to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved.   Id. at 17.  \nAccordingly, the agency  contends that these discussions are meaningful and not \nmisleading, and exceeded the minimum requirements established by the FAR.  Id.  \nat 19.   \n Discussions must, at a minimum, address significant weaknesses, deficiencies and \nadverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond.  FAR 15.306(d)(3); American States Utilities Servs., Inc. , \nB-291307.3, June 30, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 150 at 6 .  Moreover, while issues pertaining to \nprice are within the ambit of discussions these issues are treated distinctly from \nsignificant weaknesses and deficiencies in the non- price proposal.  See e.g. , FAR  \n15.306(d) (discussions may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract) .  In this regard, contracting officers are \nspecifically given the discretion, rather than charged with the obligation, to discuss \nwhether an offeror\u2019s price is considered to be too high or too low.  FAR 15.306(e)(3); \nsee also Theodor Wille Intertrade AG , B-409976.3, Jan. 22, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 65 at 4 \n(discussing the discretion given to contracting officers with respect to discussions related to price).   \n In short, on the facts present here, where the agency did not conclude that the protester\u2019s price is unreasonably high and the agency has not otherwise raised comparative price with other offerors, our decisions are clear that a contracting officer is not obligated to raise the fact that an offeror\u2019s price is higher than other offerors in \ndiscussions.   See, e.g., NOVA Dine, LLC , B-420454, B -420454.2, Apr. 15, 2022, \n2022 CPD \u00b6 101 at 6 (\u201c[T]here is no requirement for an agency to inform an offeror \nduring dis cussions that its price may be too high, where the offeror\u2019s price is not \nconsidered excessive or unreasonable\u201d); SOC LLC,  B-419977,  B-419977.2, Oct. 15, \n2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 370 (notwithstanding the fact that the agency engaged in wide-ranging discussions and included several other discussion questions concerning price,   Page 8 B-421745.4  the agency was not required to raise the fact that the protester\u2019s price was higher than \nother offerors\u2019 prices because the protester\u2019s price was not unreasonably high).  Accordingly, we see no basis to sustain the protest.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n  "

The solicitation established that award would be made on a \nbest-value basis, considering the following three evaluation factors:  (1) technical; \n(2) past performance; and (3) cost\/price.  Id.  Specifically, the solicitation set forth that \naward would be made to the offeror \u201cdetermined to be the lowest evaluated (fair and \nreasonable) priced proposal that is determined Technically Acceptable with Substantial Confidence in Past Performance.\u201d  Id.   \n The Army received five timely proposals, including those submitted by the protester, SHJV, and the awardee, RRST.

In accordance with the award \nmethodology specified in the solicitation, the source selection authority (SSA) \u201cdetermined that R RST is the Offeror whose Technically Acceptable proposal \nrepresents the lowest Total Evaluated Price with a Substantial Confidence Past Performance Rating.\u201d  Protest exh. 3, Source Selection Decision Document at 9.  The SSA found Red River\u2019s pr ice fair and reasonable as well as realistic for the work to be \nperformed and selected Red River\u2019s proposal for award in the amount of \n$68,056,924.33.  Id.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of SHJV\u2019s past performance.   \nPursuant to section 21.11 of our Bid Protest Regulations, the Army requests dismissal of SHJV\u2019s protest because \u201cthe solicitation at issue in SHJV\u2019s GAO protest is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   \nThe protester opposes dismissal .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  For the reasons \nexplained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate here.  \n The Two Protests  \n The solicitation stated the agency would \u201c assess the contract references provided in the \nOfferor\u2019s task order proposal to date, and other information available from sources other than those identified by the Offeror .\u201d  RFP at 54.   The solicitation provided detailed \ninstructions establishing the formatting and specifying the type of content to be included \nin offerors\u2019 past performance references .  Id. generally at 41-45.  Relevant here, the \nsolicitation specifically required offerors to \u201cidentify all recent contracts where it or its proposed JV Partners or Subcontractor experienced any performance problems that occurred within three years prior to the closing date of this  RFP, \u201d and to provide various \ninformation about the nature of the problems, including providing \u201ccopies of all Level III Corrective Action Reports (CARs).\u201d   RFP at 44- 45.   \n The protester included six past performance references and past performance questionnaires (PPQs) in its proposal , one of which was for SHJV\u2019s work on a prior \nEAGLE BOA order  at Aberdeen Providing Ground (APG), Maryland--contract order \nNo. W519TC -23-G-0008\/W519TC24F0081.  Protest at 12; Protest exh. 5A, SHJV Past \nPerformance Proposal at 50.   The protest refers to this order as the \u201cAPG  Task Order\u201d  \nor \u201cAPG EAGLE Task Order.\u201d  Protest at 12.   With regards to performance on that \norder, t he protester maintains:   Page 3     B-423364   Since the commencement of performance, SHJV has been met by APG \nEAGLE Task Order Senior Leadership with negative, if not resentful, and factually unsupported sentiments characterized by a two shop divide between ACC -RI and AMC\n[2] regarding a historical preference for the \nincumbent Bowhead who did not win the award in what SHJV has \ndescribed as suggestive \u201cole boys club\u201d to DOD  [Department of D efense] \ninvestigators whereunder a clear CAR issuance proclivity preference \nwould be the means of effecting APG\u2019s clear intent to attempt to \nundermine SHJV\u2019s performance capabilities through unwarranted, \nsubstantial non[ -]payments and issuance of unwarranted CARS to set \nforth a narrative under which APG could effect  an uncompleted sole \nsource award to incumbent Bowhead and remove SHJV from APG EAGLE Task Order without any basis.  \n Id.  SHJV represents that these issues \u201care now under investigation of the DOD \nInspector General and AMC Inspector General respectively for reprisal and abuse of authority (discretion).\u201d  Id. at 14. \n The protester argues  the agency\u2019s consideration of the PPQ for the APG Task Order as \npart of the past performance evaluation \u201cwas unreasonably prejudicial because the APG PPQ was tainted by false information and was only one of six eligible past performance questionnaire submissions --5 of which, the Army\u2019s debriefing reflects were determined \nto support a Substantial Confidence Rating.\u201d   Protest at 14.  Additionally, the protester \nasserts the agency failed to consider information that was \u201ctoo close at hand to ignore\u201d regarding the ongoing inspector general investigations into the APG Task Order.  Id. \nat 17.  The protester contends that \u201c[b]ut for the Army\u2019s unreasonably prejudicial \noverweighting of the SHJV APG PPQ, [the] Army would have had a high expectation \n(i.e., Substantial Confidence) that SHJV would successfully perform,\u201d which would have \nresulted in SHJV\u2019s lower -priced, technically  acceptable proposal being selected for \naward.  Id.  at 14, 17- 18. \n After SHJV filed its protest , the Army informed our Office  that \u201canother unsuccessful \nofferor (i.e.  Gemini Tech Services, LLC) filed a protest at the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims (COFC) involving the same solicitation at issue in SHJV\u2019s GAO protest ,\u201d and \nrequested dismissal of SHJV\u2019s protest.   Req. for Dismissal at 2.   At the COFC, Gemini \nchallenges the agency\u2019s evaluation and resulting decision to award to R RST under  the \nsame solicitation (RFP No. W519TC -23-R-0088) .  Req. for Dismissal Tab 1, Redacted \nCOFC Complaint at 2.   According to Gemini , had the Army  reasonably evaluated \nproposals, Gemini\u2019s lower proposed price means  it would have had \u201c a substantial \nchance for award. \u201d  Id. at 3-4. \n \n \n2 ACC- RI is the U.S. Army Contracting Command--Rock Island, which is the office that \nissued the solicitation at issue in this protest.

Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-218241, June 18, \n1985, 85- 1 CPD \u00b6 696 at 2.   \n The protester  opposes dismissal , arguing that  the Competition in Contracting Act \n(CICA) \u201cboth expressly and indirectly speaks to Congress\u2019s intent that the GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Court over protests of the same procurement under the circumstances.\u201d   Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2 .  In support of this argument, SHJV \ninclude s the following citations to CICA in its protest:  \n \n31 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 3551(a) (\u201c [n]othing contained in this section shall be \nconstrued to give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over \nprotests\u201d); 31 U.S.C.

Relying on these citations, SHJV asserts that \n\u201cCongress\u2019s intent that GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction is clear,\u201d and that it is \n\u201cclearly appropriate for the GAO to exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with CICA\u2019s \nCongressional delegation of authority where protests involve different factors, different plaintiffs, and where[,]  as here; the Gemini protest falls flat on its face.\u201d  Id. \n Further, SHJV  maintains  \u201cthat implementing regulations must constitutionally comport \nwith Congressional statutory intent, not derivate, in lieu of a Congressional Act to the contrary.\u201d  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2.  On this basis, SHJV asserts \u201c[t]here is no \nconstitutional basis for the GAO\u2019s rule at 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.11 implementing Congress\u2019s CICA in a manner departing from the CICA\u2019s express jurisdictional grant to the GAO and the underlying intent of Congress that the GAO exercise bid protest j urisdict ion \nconcurrently regardless of whether the same procurement is being protested in proceedings before the Court.\u201d   Id.  Thus, according to the protester , because \u201cCICA \nexpressly provides the GAO with concurrent jurisdiction under the circumstances\u201d  this \nmeans \u201cSHJV\u2019s protest cannot be dismissed.\u201d  Id. \n As an initial matter, we note that the sections of CICA --to which the protester purports to \nreference-- do not exist ; there is no section 3551(a) or section 3551(e) in title 31 of the \nUnited States Code.   Rather, section 3551 of title 31 is divided into numbered, not \nlettered, subparagraphs --e.g.,  3551(1) --that set out the definitions of the terms \u201cprotest,\u201d \n\u201cinterested party,\u201d and \u201cFederal agency,\u201d as used in CICA.   31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551(1) -(3).  \nNor do any of the numbered subparagraphs of section 3551 include the language SHJV \nclaims to quote from CICA.  Compare 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 with  Resp. to Req. for \nDismissal at 2.   Rather, with respect to the \u201c nonexclusivity of remedies ,\u201d CICA simply \nprovides : \n \nNonexclusivity of remedies; matters included in agency record  This subchapter does not give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the United States Court  of Federal Claims . \n 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3556.   \n Our Office has decided bid protests for decades  prior to CICA\u2019s 1984 codification of our \nbid protest jurisdiction.\n3  See e.g., Comptroller General McCarl to R.P.

Concurrently, Lear Siegler  filed su it \nin the United States District Court  for the Central District of California , seeking injunctive \nand declaratory relief .  Id.  In this connection, the suit raised \u201c substantially the same \nissues raised\u201d  in the protest before GAO .  Id.  The district court expressed an interest in \nour opinion on the matter  and, as a result, we issued what was, in effect, an advisory \nopinion, deny ing Lear Siegler\u2019s protest.  Id.   Lear Siegler later requested reconsideration \nof our decision, and we dismissed the request pursuant to what was then section 21.9(a) of our regulations  (1985) , which is equivalent to section 21.11(b) of  our current \nregulations.  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1.   \n \nLear Siegler argued against dismissal, contending--similar to SHJV here--that our \nregulations did not require dismissal  because CICA \u201ccontemplates parallel judicial and \nadministrative remedies.\u201d  Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1.  We disagreed.  Id.   In \ndismissing Lear Siegler\u2019s request  for reconsideration, our Office  explained:  \n \nFurther, as reflected in our regulations, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.9(a)  (1985), our \npolicy of not considering protests where the issues presented are before a court of competent jurisdiction, and there has been no expression of interest for our opinion from the court, has remained unchanged under CICA.

The reason for this policy is that the court\u2019s determination on the \nmerits will constitute a final adjudication and take precedence over a \ndecision by our Office.  See Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-218241, June 18, 1985, \n85-1 CPD \u00b6 696.  Similarly, we see nothing in CICA requiring our Office to \nchange its policy against considering requests for reconsideration in the \nabsence of an expression of interest from the court to which our opinion \nwas fur nished.  \n \nId. at 1-2.   Page 7     B-423364   The prudential considerations  underpinning our policy of not considering protests where \nthe issues presented are before or have been decided by  a court of competent \njurisdiction --i.e., avoiding inconsistent outcomes and honoring the principle of res \njudicata--are as firmly in place today as they were forty years ago when we decided \nLear Siegler, Inc. --Recon.   Nor have there been any statutory developments over the \npast forty years that have changed our view of CICA\u2019s language vis- \u00e0-vis matters that \nare the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.  \n As discussed above,  the CICA provision  at issue states :  \u201cThis subchapter does not give \nthe Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the Uni ted States Court  of Federal Claims .\u201d  \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3556.  To interpret this language, \u201c[w]e begin with the familiar canon of \nstatutory construction that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of \nthe statute itself.\u201d  Consumer Prod.

T his language makes \nclear that protesters may choose to file their protests with  our forum or  with other  \ndesignated  fora.  Contrary to the protester\u2019s contentions, however, nothing in the plain \nlanguage of CICA dictates that we retain jurisdiction over a protest  if a related matter is \nfiled in another forum .  Rather, it is plain that CICA and our regulations \u201care designed to \nprevent protesters from maintaining the same action in separate forums .\u201d  Systems \nEng\u2019g and Mgmt.

Id.  Accordingly, we find nothing in the plain \nlanguage of CICA to support the protester\u2019s argument that we are required to exercise concurrent jurisdiction, or that we are barred from dismissing a protest under  section \n21.11(b) of our regulations.   See  Id.; Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1-2.    \n  Page 8     B-423364   Effect of Judicial Proceedings  \n Beyond objecting to section 21.11 of our regulations generally, the protester also \nopposes dismissal  because, in SHJV\u2019s view, Gemini\u2019s protest before the COFC will not \nmoot SHJV\u2019s protest with our Office .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  According to \nSHJV, Gemini\u2019s protest \u201cwill be dismissed or denied by the Court of Federal Claims \nbecause Gemini lacks standing.\u201d  Id.  In SHJV\u2019s  assessment , the \u201cArmy will as likely as \nnot seek dismissal of Gemini\u2019s protest at the Court for failure to state [a] claim, [or] lack \nof jurisdiction as Gemini is not an interested party, and\/or will successfully defend against the same.\u201d  Id.  The protester insists that \u201cGemini\u2019s protest will be dismissed \nand\/or denied,\u201d and \u201ctherefore, the Gemini protest cannot and will not render [SHJV\u2019s] protest along with possible, necessary outcomes academic.\u201d  Id.    \n While SHJV claims to know how the court  will adjudicate Gemini\u2019s protest, our Office \nhas no basis --factual, legal, or otherwise--to reach such a conclusion.  Moreover, if \ndismissal of a protest in our forum were dependent on how our Office speculates or perceives a court will dispose of  a protest before it, such a result would vitiate the \nprudential considerations underlying the purpose of section 21.11.   Rather, in resolving \nthe agency \u2019s request for dismissal, the standard we apply is whether a court\u2019s \nconsideration of an issue may  render a decision by our Office academic.  Continental \nServ. Group, Inc.; et al., supra at 7 n.5.  As noted above, our decisions have explained \nthat this is the appropriate standard because, as a prudential matter, deference to a court\u2019s resolution of similar protest issues obviates the risk of an inconsistent resolution of such issues between forums.  Id. at 7; see also Robinson Enters. --Req. for Recon. , \nsupra.   \n Here, both SHJV\u2019s protest before our Office and Gemini\u2019s protest before the COFC \nchallenge aspects of the Army\u2019s evaluation and source selection under the same solicitation, and notwithstanding SHJV\u2019s insistence to the contrary, it is possible that the court  will adjudicate the merits of Gemini\u2019s protest, find in Gemini\u2019s favor, and order the \nArmy to re -open the evaluation process, potentially leading to a new source selection \ndecision.  Accordingly , because it is possible that the adjudication of Gemini\u2019s protest by \nthe COFC could render SHJV\u2019s protest before our Office academic, dismissal is \nappropriate here.

The solicitation established that award would be made on a \nbest-value basis, considering the following three evaluation factors:  (1) technical; \n(2) past performance; and (3) cost\/price.  Id.  Specifically, the solicitation set forth that \naward would be made to the offeror \u201cdetermined to be the lowest evaluated (fair and \nreasonable) priced proposal that is determined Technically Acceptable with Substantial Confidence in Past Performance.\u201d  Id.   \n The Army received five timely proposals, including those submitted by the protester, SHJV, and the awardee, RRST.  Req. for Dismissal at 2.  In accordance with the award \nmethodology specified in the solicitation, the source selection authority (SSA) \u201cdetermined that R RST is the Offeror whose Technically Acceptable proposal \nrepresents the lowest Total Evaluated Price with a Substantial Confidence Past Performance Rating.\u201d  Protest exh. 3, Source Selection Decision Document at 9.  The SSA found Red River\u2019s pr ice fair and reasonable as well as realistic for the work to be \nperformed and selected Red River\u2019s proposal for award in the amount of \n$68,056,924.33.  Id.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of SHJV\u2019s past performance.   \nPursuant to section 21.11 of our Bid Protest Regulations, the Army requests dismissal of SHJV\u2019s protest because \u201cthe solicitation at issue in SHJV\u2019s GAO protest is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Req. for Dismissal at 1.   \nThe protester opposes dismissal .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  For the reasons \nexplained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate here.  \n The Two Protests  \n The solicitation stated the agency would \u201c assess the contract references provided in the \nOfferor\u2019s task order proposal to date, and other information available from sources other than those identified by the Offeror .\u201d  RFP at 54.   The solicitation provided detailed \ninstructions establishing the formatting and specifying the type of content to be included \nin offerors\u2019 past performance references .  Id. generally at 41-45.  Relevant here, the \nsolicitation specifically required offerors to \u201cidentify all recent contracts where it or its proposed JV Partners or Subcontractor experienced any performance problems that occurred within three years prior to the closing date of this  RFP, \u201d and to provide various \ninformation about the nature of the problems, including providing \u201ccopies of all Level III Corrective Action Reports (CARs).\u201d   RFP at 44- 45.   \n The protester included six past performance references and past performance questionnaires (PPQs) in its proposal , one of which was for SHJV\u2019s work on a prior \nEAGLE BOA order  at Aberdeen Providing Ground (APG), Maryland--contract order \nNo. W519TC -23-G-0008\/W519TC24F0081.  Protest at 12; Protest exh. 5A, SHJV Past \nPerformance Proposal at 50.   The protest refers to this order as the \u201cAPG  Task Order\u201d  \nor \u201cAPG EAGLE Task Order.\u201d  Protest at 12.   With regards to performance on that \norder, t he protester maintains:   Page 3     B-423364   Since the commencement of performance, SHJV has been met by APG \nEAGLE Task Order Senior Leadership with negative, if not resentful, and factually unsupported sentiments characterized by a two shop divide between ACC -RI and AMC\n[2] regarding a historical preference for the \nincumbent Bowhead who did not win the award in what SHJV has \ndescribed as suggestive \u201cole boys club\u201d to DOD  [Department of D efense] \ninvestigators whereunder a clear CAR issuance proclivity preference \nwould be the means of effecting APG\u2019s clear intent to attempt to \nundermine SHJV\u2019s performance capabilities through unwarranted, \nsubstantial non[ -]payments and issuance of unwarranted CARS to set \nforth a narrative under which APG could effect  an uncompleted sole \nsource award to incumbent Bowhead and remove SHJV from APG EAGLE Task Order without any basis.  \n Id.  SHJV represents that these issues \u201care now under investigation of the DOD \nInspector General and AMC Inspector General respectively for reprisal and abuse of authority (discretion).\u201d  Id. at 14. \n The protester argues  the agency\u2019s consideration of the PPQ for the APG Task Order as \npart of the past performance evaluation \u201cwas unreasonably prejudicial because the APG PPQ was tainted by false information and was only one of six eligible past performance questionnaire submissions --5 of which, the Army\u2019s debriefing reflects were determined \nto support a Substantial Confidence Rating.\u201d   Protest at 14.  Additionally, the protester \nasserts the agency failed to consider information that was \u201ctoo close at hand to ignore\u201d regarding the ongoing inspector general investigations into the APG Task Order.  Id. \nat 17.  The protester contends that \u201c[b]ut for the Army\u2019s unreasonably prejudicial \noverweighting of the SHJV APG PPQ, [the] Army would have had a high expectation \n(i.e., Substantial Confidence) that SHJV would successfully perform,\u201d which would have \nresulted in SHJV\u2019s lower -priced, technically  acceptable proposal being selected for \naward.  Id.  at 14, 17- 18. \n After SHJV filed its protest , the Army informed our Office  that \u201canother unsuccessful \nofferor (i.e.  Gemini Tech Services, LLC) filed a protest at the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims (COFC) involving the same solicitation at issue in SHJV\u2019s GAO protest ,\u201d and \nrequested dismissal of SHJV\u2019s protest.

Relying on these citations, SHJV asserts that \n\u201cCongress\u2019s intent that GAO exercise concurrent jurisdiction is clear,\u201d and that it is \n\u201cclearly appropriate for the GAO to exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with CICA\u2019s \nCongressional delegation of authority where protests involve different factors, different plaintiffs, and where[,]  as here; the Gemini protest falls flat on its face.\u201d  Id. \n Further, SHJV  maintains  \u201cthat implementing regulations must constitutionally comport \nwith Congressional statutory intent, not derivate, in lieu of a Congressional Act to the contrary.\u201d  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 2.  On this basis, SHJV asserts \u201c[t]here is no \nconstitutional basis for the GAO\u2019s rule at 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.11 implementing Congress\u2019s CICA in a manner departing from the CICA\u2019s express jurisdictional grant to the GAO and the underlying intent of Congress that the GAO exercise bid protest j urisdict ion \nconcurrently regardless of whether the same procurement is being protested in proceedings before the Court.\u201d   Id.  Thus, according to the protester , because \u201cCICA \nexpressly provides the GAO with concurrent jurisdiction under the circumstances\u201d  this \nmeans \u201cSHJV\u2019s protest cannot be dismissed.\u201d  Id. \n As an initial matter, we note that the sections of CICA --to which the protester purports to \nreference-- do not exist ; there is no section 3551(a) or section 3551(e) in title 31 of the \nUnited States Code.   Rather, section 3551 of title 31 is divided into numbered, not \nlettered, subparagraphs --e.g.,  3551(1) --that set out the definitions of the terms \u201cprotest,\u201d \n\u201cinterested party,\u201d and \u201cFederal agency,\u201d as used in CICA.   31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551(1) -(3).  \nNor do any of the numbered subparagraphs of section 3551 include the language SHJV \nclaims to quote from CICA.

Rather, with respect to the \u201c nonexclusivity of remedies ,\u201d CICA simply \nprovides : \n \nNonexclusivity of remedies; matters included in agency record  This subchapter does not give the Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the United States Court  of Federal Claims . \n 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3556.   \n Our Office has decided bid protests for decades  prior to CICA\u2019s 1984 codification of our \nbid protest jurisdiction.\n3  See e.g., Comptroller General McCarl to R.P.

Page 7     B-423364   The prudential considerations  underpinning our policy of not considering protests where \nthe issues presented are before or have been decided by  a court of competent \njurisdiction --i.e., avoiding inconsistent outcomes and honoring the principle of res \njudicata--are as firmly in place today as they were forty years ago when we decided \nLear Siegler, Inc. --Recon.   Nor have there been any statutory developments over the \npast forty years that have changed our view of CICA\u2019s language vis- \u00e0-vis matters that \nare the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.  \n As discussed above,  the CICA provision  at issue states :  \u201cThis subchapter does not give \nthe Comptroller General exclusive jurisdiction over protests, and nothing contained in this subchapter shall affect the right of any interested party to file a protest with the contracting agency or to file an action in the Uni ted States Court  of Federal Claims .\u201d  \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3556.

T his language makes \nclear that protesters may choose to file their protests with  our forum or  with other  \ndesignated  fora.  Contrary to the protester\u2019s contentions, however, nothing in the plain \nlanguage of CICA dictates that we retain jurisdiction over a protest  if a related matter is \nfiled in another forum .  Rather, it is plain that CICA and our regulations \u201care designed to \nprevent protesters from maintaining the same action in separate forums .\u201d  Systems \nEng\u2019g and Mgmt.

Id.  Accordingly, we find nothing in the plain \nlanguage of CICA to support the protester\u2019s argument that we are required to exercise concurrent jurisdiction, or that we are barred from dismissing a protest under  section \n21.11(b) of our regulations.   See  Id.; Lear Siegler, Inc. --Recon., supra at 1-2.    \n  Page 8     B-423364   Effect of Judicial Proceedings  \n Beyond objecting to section 21.11 of our regulations generally, the protester also \nopposes dismissal  because, in SHJV\u2019s view, Gemini\u2019s protest before the COFC will not \nmoot SHJV\u2019s protest with our Office .  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal at 1.  According to \nSHJV, Gemini\u2019s protest \u201cwill be dismissed or denied by the Court of Federal Claims \nbecause Gemini lacks standing.\u201d  Id.

The protester insists that \u201cGemini\u2019s protest will be dismissed \nand\/or denied,\u201d and \u201ctherefore, the Gemini protest cannot and will not render [SHJV\u2019s] protest along with possible, necessary outcomes academic.\u201d  Id.    \n While SHJV claims to know how the court  will adjudicate Gemini\u2019s protest, our Office \nhas no basis --factual, legal, or otherwise--to reach such a conclusion.  Moreover, if \ndismissal of a protest in our forum were dependent on how our Office speculates or perceives a court will dispose of  a protest before it, such a result would vitiate the \nprudential considerations underlying the purpose of section 21.11.   Rather, in resolving \nthe agency \u2019s request for dismissal, the standard we apply is whether a court\u2019s \nconsideration of an issue may  render a decision by our Office academic.  Continental \nServ. Group, Inc.; et al., supra at 7 n.5.  As noted above, our decisions have explained \nthat this is the appropriate standard because, as a prudential matter, deference to a court\u2019s resolution of similar protest issues obviates the risk of an inconsistent resolution of such issues between forums.

RFP at 19, 22.3  The RFP stated that the procurement \nwould be conducted in two phases, and up to 10 of the most highly qualified offerors would be invited to submit phase two proposals following the phase one evaluation.  Id.  \nat 23.  \n The RFP stated that phase one proposals would be evaluated under the following three technical f actor s, listed in descending order of importance:  past performance; \nconstruction execution approach; and organization management team.  Id. at 24.  Past \nperformance was to be evaluated to assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of the performance and assigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, limited, or no confidence.\n4  Id. at 34 -35.  The remaining technical \nfactors would be evaluated and assigned one of the following adjectival ratings:  outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 35.  The RFP stated:   \n \nAny proposal that receives less than an \u201cAcceptable\u201d rating in a technical factor or less than a \u201cSatisfactory Confidence\u201d past performance rating will be ineligible for award and will not participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  Based upon the ratings, the Government will select the most \nhighly rated Offerors to participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  \n \nId. at 34.  \n The agency evaluated 21 phase one proposals received in response to the solicitation, including a proposal from RKE.  AR, Tab 13, Down- Select Decision Document at 4- 5.  \nRKE received a past performance rating of s atisfactory confidence with a relevancy \nrating of somewhat relevant .  Id. at 5.  RKE was rated as marginal under the \nconstruction execution approach factor, and acceptable under the organization \n \n2 Elsewhere, the RFP identified \u201ca target of up to [five IDIQ contracts] awarded to Small \nBusinesses.\u201d  Agency Report (AR), Tab 4, RFP at 23.  \n3 The RFP was amended four times.  Citations to the RFP in this decision are to the \nfinal conformed RFP provided by the agency as tab 4.  Additionally, all page citations in this decision are to Adobe Acrobat PDF page numbers.  \n4 The RFP defined recent as \u201ccompleted, or currently in progress with at least 50 \n[percent] construction completed, within the past ten (10) years as of the date the solicitation was issued.\u201d  RFP at 29.  Additionally, relevancy would be assessed for scope,  magnitude of effort, and complexity, and assigned the following ratings:  very \nrelevant, relevant, somewhat relevant, or not relevant.

Because of its marginal rating under the construction execution \nfactor, RKE\u2019s proposal  was not included amongst the ten most highly qualified \nproposals  invited to phase two.  Id. at 5, 17.   \n On March 10, 2025, RKE received a debriefing that explained the agency\u2019s rationale for \nthe elimination of its proposal from phase two of the procurement.  AR, Tab 14, RKE Debriefing.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably and irrationally eliminated RKE from phase two of the competition.  According to the protester, the ratings assigned by the agency are unreasonable given RKE\u2019s capabilities and the information provided in i ts \nproposal.  Protest at 1.  The protester challenges its evaluation under each of the phase one evaluation factors, including the ratings assigned and all weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and a deficiency identified by the evaluators.  Id. at 10- 33. \n At the outset, we note that in reviewing protests challenging the evaluation of an offeror\u2019s proposal, it is not our role to reevaluate proposals; rather, our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s judgment was reasonable, and in acco rdance with applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Patriot Def. Grp., \nLLC, B-418720.3, Aug. 5, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 265 at 7.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with \nthe agency\u2019s evaluation, without more, does not establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  A -P-T Research, Inc. , B-414825, B -414825.2, Sept. 27, 2017, 2017 \nCPD \u00b6 337 at 4.  \n For the reasons explained below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  We find that the agency reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to the protester\u2019s proposal under the construction execution approach factor and that, as a result, the protester cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with regard to its remaining challenges.  While our decision does not address every variation of every argument raised by the protester, our Office has considered them all and find none afford a basis on whic h to \nsustain the protest.  \n Evaluation of RKE\u2019s Construction Execution Approach  \n The protester argues that its proposal addressed all the minimum requirements to be rated acceptable rather than marginal under the construction execution approach factor, and the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Protest at 15- 16.  Specificall y, the \nprotester challenges a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the agency, arguing the evaluation findings were flawed because the RFP did not require the level of detail the agency evaluated as missing from RKE\u2019s  proposal.  \nAlternatively, the protester argues that the agency failed to fully consider the information that RKE provided in its proposal.  Id.  at 15- 27. \n  Page 4 B-423394  The agency argues that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the \nevaluation criteria, and that it properly rated RKE\u2019s proposal as marginal and deemed it ineligible for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 4.  In particular, the agency \nargues t hat the RFP emphasized the importance of experience performing \npreconstruction services , which RKE\u2019s proposal failed to address, and that all the \nchallenged findings validly stemmed from a common issue--a severe lack of detail in \nRKE\u2019s  proposal . \n Id. at 4-10.  We agree with the agency.  \n As relevant to the protester\u2019s arguments, regarding construction execution approach, section 6.1.1 of the RFP required that offerors provide a narrative approach to address \nthe following eight challenges : \n a) Understanding of the process to adequately address and anticipate both the benefits  and risks associated with Design- Build projects for U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers  or other [Department of Defense]  component.  \n b) Discussion on the utilization of alternative delivery methods and preconstruction services as identified in paragraph 5.2.2 to include a comparison of differences between the public and private sector constraints.\n[5] \n c) Sourcing and management of major materials (e.g., borrow material, steel, concrete, etc.) and mitigation of major supply chain issues.  \n d) Obtaining access to work locations.  \n e) Coordination with local property owners and stakeholders.  \n f) Compliance with contractual, administrative, and other requirements.  \n g) Hiring qualified laborers and maintaining a qualified workforce.  \n h) Coordination with multiple contractors on site.  \n RFP at 30- 31.  The RFP limited narrative responses to 10 pages.  Id.   Section 6.1.2 of \nthe RFP stated the agency would evaluate the narrative response provided in the proposal as follows:    \na) Offerors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable.  \n \n \n5 Paragraph 5.2.2 of the RFP referred to a number of different preconstruction services, \nincluding cost estimation, evaluation of design documents for constructability, recommendations on construction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other  things.  RFP at 29.   Page 5 B-423394  b) Evidence of understanding and mitigating the construction execution \nchallenges specific to Civil Works Program through traditional Design- Bid-\nBuild and Design- Build processes may be considered a strength.  \n c) Offerors should demonstrate understanding and experience in the execution of preconstruction services.  An acceptable discussion would identify experience performing preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project success, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the owner and\/or stakeholders.  \n d) Approaches that provided innovative means and\/or methods for operating in unforeseen conditions including, but not limited to, emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, real estate coordination, restricted access, supply chain demands, on site coordination, environmental compliance issues, and long lead  \nitem procurement process may be considered a strength.  \n Id. at 31.  The RFP stated that the narratives should substantiate the offeror\u2019s \nconstruction approach by relating technical solutions and project execution challenges, and that the government would evaluate \u201cthe offeror\u2019s technical approach on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its relevance to the work\u201d required by the RFP.  Id.  \n The evaluators identified the following deficiency in RKE\u2019s proposal under the construction execution approach factor:  \u201c Instead of listing how the work would be \nachieved, the Offeror repeated what was in the RFP as a response to Section 6.1.1.  \nThe SSEB [Source Selection Evaluation Board] noted that the offeror\u2019s proposal \noccasionally reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the solicitation and does not provide adequate details to demonstrate understanding of the requirements. \u201d  AR, Tab 11, Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  This deficiency \nwas in addition to three significant weaknesses and four weaknesses, each of which to varying degrees identify RKE\u2019s failure to discuss or adequately detail its approach to various aspects of the requirement.  For example, one significant weakness stated:  \u201cThe importance and usage of preconstruction services (as specified in Section 6.1.2.C) is not discussed within this proposal.\u201d  Id.    \n The evaluators provided the following rationale for assigning a marginal rating:  \n \nOverall, the construction execution approach proposed by [RKE] does not demonstrate an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is high. . . .  [RKE] does not demonstrate that they have a thorough approa ch to construction \nexecution.  The information provided does not provide sufficient detail when describing their experience or knowledge of design- build and the \nimportant elements necessary for success as listed in this solicitation.  [RFP] Section 6.1.2.C  states that the offeror should demonstrate  Page 6 B-423394  understanding and experience in execution of preconstruction services.  \nThe application of preconstruction services is one of the main benefits of the Design- Build process and the proposal \u201chas not demonstrated an \nadequate understanding of the requirements \u201d by leaving out \npreconstruction services. . . .  The proposal indicates a marginal approach and understanding of the requirements of the solicitation such that the SSEB is confident that the risk of unsuccessful performance is high.  \n Id.  The agency argues that the evaluators reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to \nRKE\u2019s construction execution approach, and in accordance with the RFP its proposal \nwas properly deemed ineligible for award.  MOL at 3 -4. The agency explains that the \nprotester\u2019s proposal did not include an adequate discussion of preconstruction services, including cost estimating, evaluation of design documents for constructability, identification of construction related problems or errors in design, recommendations on cons truction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other things required by \nthe solicitation.  Id.  at 5. \n In a negotiated procurement, it is an offeror\u2019s responsibility to submit a well -written \nproposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Probity, \nInc., B-420210, Dec. 21, 2021, 2023 CPD \u00b6 38 at 3.  If a proposal omits, inadequately \naddresses, or fails to clearly convey required information, the offeror runs the risk of an adverse agency evaluation.  See Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc. , B-418375.2,  May 28, \n2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 207 at 4.  \n \nOn this record, we find that the protester has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s \nevaluation was flawed.  The protester argues that its proposal did indeed address \npreconstruction services, along with the utilization of alternate delivery methods, as requi red by the RFP.  Protest at 21- 22 (citing AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal  \nat 69- 70).  In support of its position, RKE points to the following paragraph of its \nproposal under the heading \u201c Construction Manager as Constructor (CMC) and \nConstruction Manager at Risk ( CMAR) ,\u201d which states as follows:  \n \nA defining characteristic of a Construction Manager  [as Constructor]  \n(CMC) contract (of any type) is the timing of their  involvement in the \nproject.  In the traditional Design- Bid-Build delivery method, the \nconstruction entity is  not involved until the \u201cBid\u201d portion of the project. \nDesign occurs without the involvement of a  construction entity.   When a \nconstruction manager is involved by contract, they are involved in \u201cpreconstruction\u201d  activities.  Therefore, during design, they can be \ncontracted to offer s chedule, budget, and constructability input or \nfeedback to the owner.  This early involvement can be beneficial if the owner and\/or design firm do not have strong construction experience to draw upon internally.  \n AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal at 69 (emphasis added).    Page 7 B-423394   \nThe paragraph quoted above, however, is the only place with any mention of preconstruction, and the protester has not cited to any other portion of its proposal to demonstrate that it provided \u201c[a] n acceptable discussion [identify ing] experience \nperforming preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project \nsuccess, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the \nowner and\/or stakeholders ,\u201d as required by the RFP.  See  RFP at 31.  Instead, the \nremaining three paragraphs in this section of the proposal provide a general discussion of the relationships under a CMC and CMAR approach but fail to provide specific experience with a project in which RKE performed preconstruction services, their influence on the succ ess of the project, or how the services mitigated risks and provided \nbenefits to owners of and stakeholders of the project.  See generally  AR, Tab 9, RKE \nProposal at 69- 70.  We also note RKE\u2019s proposal provided less than four full pages of \nnarrative response, less than half of the 10 pages the RFP permitted for offerors to explain their construction execution approach.  Id. at 68 -71. \n After review of the agency report, RKE cites to additional sections of its proposal and argues that in addition to addressing preconstruction services generally, its proposal also addressed the preconstruction services of cost estimating, constructability,  \nidentification of construction- related problems, and value engineering.\n6  See  Comments \nat 3-6.  The protester argues that \u201c[a]t best, [the agency] can suggest that that portion of \nthe proposal focused too heavily on alternative delivery methods to the detriment of preconstruction services . . . and fails to understand the relations hip between alternative \ndelivery methods and preconstruction services.\u201d  Id. at 4.  However, as noted above, \nwhile the RFP required offerors to address their utilization of alternative delivery \nmethods and preconstruction services, the evaluation criteria emphasized that offerors \nshould \u201cdemonstrate understanding and experience in  the execution of preconstruction \nservices.\u201d  RFP at 31.  RKE failed to heed this directive at the risk of an unfavorable evaluation.  Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc., supra.  Moreov er, the language from RKE\u2019s \nproposal that it cites as examples of where it addressed preconstruction services provides limited detail and instead often simply restates solicitation requirements, which is why the agency assessed the deficiency under this factor.  \n To the extent the protester now seeks to more clearly articulate the information provided in its proposal to address preconstruction services, our review is limited to RKE\u2019s proposal as submitted.  In this regard, contracting agencies are not responsible f or \nevaluating information that is not included in a quotation or proposal.  Patriot Def . Grp., \nLLC, supra at 9.  I t was incumbent upon RKE  to submit a clear and adequate proposal \nfor evaluation and its explanation in comments  filed in a post -award protest provides no \n \n6 For example, the protester contends its proposal discussed cost estimating where it \nstated that it produces reports that \u201cat a minimum produce the basis for future design, site concepts, and well thought out construction cost estimates ,\u201d and addressed value \nengineering where it stated that having the principal contractor engaged early \u201callows the contractor to have an input in the design of the scheme and suggest value engineering changes .\u201d  Comments at 4.   Page 8 B-423394  basis to question the agency\u2019s contemporaneous evaluation of the proposal as \nsubmitted.  \n The protester also argues that the lack of detail the agency claims was absent in its proposal is an unstated evaluation criterion and otherwise insufficient to support a rating of marginal.  Protest at 15- 18.  The crux of RKE\u2019s argument is that \u201caccording to the \nRFP, merely addressing the eight challenges would result in an Acceptable rating.  There was no minimum detail threshold specified to achieve such.\u201d  Id. at 16; see also \nComments at 7 (\u201c[T]his supposed issue with details was unsupported by the RFP criteria when the RFP merely said that offerors must \u2018address\u2019 each of the eight challenges.\u201d).   \n Here, the RFP defined a rating of marginal as a proposal that \u201chas not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and\/or risk of unsuccessful performance is high.\u201d  RFP at 35.  As noted, the marginal rating assigned to RKE was  \nthe result of a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the evaluators, all of which stemmed from the lack of information provided in RKE\u2019s proposal.  AR, Tab 11, RKE Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  For example, t he \nfour weaknesses stated:   \n \nThe offeror identifies the necessity for coordination efforts for access to work locations but gives very little detail  as to what that looks like.  \n The offeror does not include any details  about coordination with owners or \nstakeholders and simply states they will coordinate when necessary.  \n The offeror describes how they will comply with contractual, administrative, and regulatory requirements by simply referencing their success in past performance and t hey do not include any details  of how \nthis success is accomplished.  \n The offeror does not address specifics  on how to mitigate problems when \ndealing with emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, restricted access, supply chain demands, or on- site coordination.  \n Id. (emphasis added).  The RFP defined a weakness as a flaw in the proposal that \nincreases the risk of unsuccessful performance.  RFP at 35.  The RFP further defined a deficiency  as \u201ca material failure of a proposal to meet a government  requirement or a \ncombination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk  of \nunsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. \u201d  Id.   \n To the extent the protester\u2019s argument is that mere mention of each of the eight challenges was enough to earn a rating of acceptable, we do not agree.  Although the RFP stated that \u201cofferors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable,\u201d the RFP also stated that the agency would \nevaluate construction execution approach \u201con the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its  Page 9 B-423394  relevance to the work that will be required in the Solicitation.\u201d  RFP at 31.  The RFP also \ncautioned offerors that to evaluate proposals effectively and equitably, the agency had to receive \u201cinformation containing sufficient detail to allow review and evaluation by the [g]overnment.\u201d  Id. at 22.  Despite its claims that the agency ignored information in its \nproposal, the protester has not cited anything in its proposal to demonstrate that any of the weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiency identi fied by the agency are \nunreasonable.  Given the terms of the solicitation, which expressly contemplated evaluating the breadth, depth, and detail of information provided by an offeror, we find no basis to conclude that the rating of marginal is unreasonabl e, where the protester\u2019s \nproposal did not discuss certain RFP requirements like preconstruction services, and therefore did not demonstrate an \u201cadequate approach and understanding of the requirements.\u201d  Accordingly, we deny these allegations.  \n Prejudice  \n Based on our resolution of the protest grounds above, we find that RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest.  We will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that but for the agency\u2019s error, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  E.g. , Technica LLC , B-417177 et \nal., Mar. 21, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 125 at 5- 7.  Where the record establishes no possibil ity \nof competitive prejudice, we will not sustain the protest even if a defect in the procurement is found.  Procentrix, Inc., B -414629, B -414629.2, Aug. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD \n\u00b6 255 at 11- 12.   \n \nHere, RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  This includes the protester\u2019s challenges to its evaluation under the past performance and o rganization  management team factors.  Under the \nexpress terms of the RFP, a proposal that received less than an acceptable rating under a technical factor was ineligible to participate in phase two of the solicitation.  RFP at 34.  As explained above, the agency reasonably assigned RKE\u2019s proposal a rating of \nmargi nal under the construction execution approach factor, thus making RKE\u2019s proposal \nineligible for phase two of the competition and award even if it should have received higher ratings under the other factors.  Because RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to its remaining protest grounds, t hey are dismissed.

This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423394  BACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the RFP on May 9, 2024, using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 procedures, with the competition set aside for small businesses.  Contracting Officer Statement (COS) at 1.  The RFP contemplated the award of one or more indefini te-delivery, indefinite -quantity (IDIQ) contracts\n2 with fixed -price task orders \nand a period of performance consisting of a 12- month based period and four additional \n12-month ordering periods.  RFP at 19, 22.3  The RFP stated that the procurement \nwould be conducted in two phases, and up to 10 of the most highly qualified offerors would be invited to submit phase two proposals following the phase one evaluation.  Id.  \nat 23.  \n The RFP stated that phase one proposals would be evaluated under the following three technical f actor s, listed in descending order of importance:  past performance; \nconstruction execution approach; and organization management team.  Id. at 24.  Past \nperformance was to be evaluated to assess the recency, relevancy, and quality of the performance and assigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, limited, or no confidence.\n4  Id. at 34 -35.  The remaining technical \nfactors would be evaluated and assigned one of the following adjectival ratings:  outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable.  Id.  at 35.  The RFP stated:   \n \nAny proposal that receives less than an \u201cAcceptable\u201d rating in a technical factor or less than a \u201cSatisfactory Confidence\u201d past performance rating will be ineligible for award and will not participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  Based upon the ratings, the Government will select the most \nhighly rated Offerors to participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  \n \nId. at 34.  \n The agency evaluated 21 phase one proposals received in response to the solicitation, including a proposal from RKE.  AR, Tab 13, Down- Select Decision Document at 4- 5.  \nRKE received a past performance rating of s atisfactory confidence with a relevancy \nrating of somewhat relevant .  Id. at 5.

AR, Tab 14, RKE Debriefing.  This protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably and irrationally eliminated RKE from phase two of the competition.  According to the protester, the ratings assigned by the agency are unreasonable given RKE\u2019s capabilities and the information provided in i ts \nproposal.  Protest at 1.  The protester challenges its evaluation under each of the phase one evaluation factors, including the ratings assigned and all weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and a deficiency identified by the evaluators.  Id. at 10- 33. \n At the outset, we note that in reviewing protests challenging the evaluation of an offeror\u2019s proposal, it is not our role to reevaluate proposals; rather, our Office examines the record to determine whether the agency\u2019s judgment was reasonable, and in acco rdance with applicable procurement statutes and regulations.

We find that the agency reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to the protester\u2019s proposal under the construction execution approach factor and that, as a result, the protester cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with regard to its remaining challenges.  While our decision does not address every variation of every argument raised by the protester, our Office has considered them all and find none afford a basis on whic h to \nsustain the protest.  \n Evaluation of RKE\u2019s Construction Execution Approach  \n The protester argues that its proposal addressed all the minimum requirements to be rated acceptable rather than marginal under the construction execution approach factor, and the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria.  Protest at 15- 16.  Specificall y, the \nprotester challenges a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the agency, arguing the evaluation findings were flawed because the RFP did not require the level of detail the agency evaluated as missing from RKE\u2019s  proposal.  \nAlternatively, the protester argues that the agency failed to fully consider the information that RKE provided in its proposal.  Id.  at 15- 27. \n  Page 4 B-423394  The agency argues that its evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the \nevaluation criteria, and that it properly rated RKE\u2019s proposal as marginal and deemed it ineligible for award.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at 3- 4.  In particular, the agency \nargues t hat the RFP emphasized the importance of experience performing \npreconstruction services , which RKE\u2019s proposal failed to address, and that all the \nchallenged findings validly stemmed from a common issue--a severe lack of detail in \nRKE\u2019s  proposal . \n Id. at 4-10.  We agree with the agency.  \n As relevant to the protester\u2019s arguments, regarding construction execution approach, section 6.1.1 of the RFP required that offerors provide a narrative approach to address \nthe following eight challenges : \n a) Understanding of the process to adequately address and anticipate both the benefits  and risks associated with Design- Build projects for U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers  or other [Department of Defense]  component.  \n b) Discussion on the utilization of alternative delivery methods and preconstruction services as identified in paragraph 5.2.2 to include a comparison of differences between the public and private sector constraints.\n[5] \n c) Sourcing and management of major materials (e.g., borrow material, steel, concrete, etc.) and mitigation of major supply chain issues.  \n d) Obtaining access to work locations.  \n e) Coordination with local property owners and stakeholders.  \n f) Compliance with contractual, administrative, and other requirements.  \n g) Hiring qualified laborers and maintaining a qualified workforce.  \n h) Coordination with multiple contractors on site.  \n RFP at 30- 31.  The RFP limited narrative responses to 10 pages.  Id.   Section 6.1.2 of \nthe RFP stated the agency would evaluate the narrative response provided in the proposal as follows:    \na) Offerors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable.  \n \n \n5 Paragraph 5.2.2 of the RFP referred to a number of different preconstruction services, \nincluding cost estimation, evaluation of design documents for constructability, recommendations on construction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other  things.  RFP at 29.   Page 5 B-423394  b) Evidence of understanding and mitigating the construction execution \nchallenges specific to Civil Works Program through traditional Design- Bid-\nBuild and Design- Build processes may be considered a strength.  \n c) Offerors should demonstrate understanding and experience in the execution of preconstruction services.  An acceptable discussion would identify experience performing preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project success, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the owner and\/or stakeholders.  \n d) Approaches that provided innovative means and\/or methods for operating in unforeseen conditions including, but not limited to, emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, real estate coordination, restricted access, supply chain demands, on site coordination, environmental compliance issues, and long lead  \nitem procurement process may be considered a strength.  \n Id. at 31.  The RFP stated that the narratives should substantiate the offeror\u2019s \nconstruction approach by relating technical solutions and project execution challenges, and that the government would evaluate \u201cthe offeror\u2019s technical approach on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its relevance to the work\u201d required by the RFP.  Id.  \n The evaluators identified the following deficiency in RKE\u2019s proposal under the construction execution approach factor:  \u201c Instead of listing how the work would be \nachieved, the Offeror repeated what was in the RFP as a response to Section 6.1.1.  \nThe SSEB [Source Selection Evaluation Board] noted that the offeror\u2019s proposal \noccasionally reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the solicitation and does not provide adequate details to demonstrate understanding of the requirements. \u201d  AR, Tab 11, Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  This deficiency \nwas in addition to three significant weaknesses and four weaknesses, each of which to varying degrees identify RKE\u2019s failure to discuss or adequately detail its approach to various aspects of the requirement.  For example, one significant weakness stated:  \u201cThe importance and usage of preconstruction services (as specified in Section 6.1.2.C) is not discussed within this proposal.\u201d  Id.    \n The evaluators provided the following rationale for assigning a marginal rating:  \n \nOverall, the construction execution approach proposed by [RKE] does not demonstrate an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and risk of unsuccessful performance is high. . . .  [RKE] does not demonstrate that they have a thorough approa ch to construction \nexecution.  The information provided does not provide sufficient detail when describing their experience or knowledge of design- build and the \nimportant elements necessary for success as listed in this solicitation.  [RFP] Section 6.1.2.C  states that the offeror should demonstrate  Page 6 B-423394  understanding and experience in execution of preconstruction services.  \nThe application of preconstruction services is one of the main benefits of the Design- Build process and the proposal \u201chas not demonstrated an \nadequate understanding of the requirements \u201d by leaving out \npreconstruction services. . . .  The proposal indicates a marginal approach and understanding of the requirements of the solicitation such that the SSEB is confident that the risk of unsuccessful performance is high.  \n Id.  The agency argues that the evaluators reasonably assigned a rating of marginal to \nRKE\u2019s construction execution approach, and in accordance with the RFP its proposal \nwas properly deemed ineligible for award.  MOL at 3 -4. The agency explains that the \nprotester\u2019s proposal did not include an adequate discussion of preconstruction services, including cost estimating, evaluation of design documents for constructability, identification of construction related problems or errors in design, recommendations on cons truction feasibility, and value engineering services, among other things required by \nthe solicitation.  Id.  at 5. \n In a negotiated procurement, it is an offeror\u2019s responsibility to submit a well -written \nproposal, with adequately detailed information that clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Probity, \nInc., B-420210, Dec. 21, 2021, 2023 CPD \u00b6 38 at 3.  If a proposal omits, inadequately \naddresses, or fails to clearly convey required information, the offeror runs the risk of an adverse agency evaluation.  See Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc. , B-418375.2,  May 28, \n2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 207 at 4.  \n \nOn this record, we find that the protester has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s \nevaluation was flawed.  The protester argues that its proposal did indeed address \npreconstruction services, along with the utilization of alternate delivery methods, as requi red by the RFP.  Protest at 21- 22 (citing AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal  \nat 69- 70).  In support of its position, RKE points to the following paragraph of its \nproposal under the heading \u201c Construction Manager as Constructor (CMC) and \nConstruction Manager at Risk ( CMAR) ,\u201d which states as follows:  \n \nA defining characteristic of a Construction Manager  [as Constructor]  \n(CMC) contract (of any type) is the timing of their  involvement in the \nproject.  In the traditional Design- Bid-Build delivery method, the \nconstruction entity is  not involved until the \u201cBid\u201d portion of the project. \nDesign occurs without the involvement of a  construction entity.   When a \nconstruction manager is involved by contract, they are involved in \u201cpreconstruction\u201d  activities.  Therefore, during design, they can be \ncontracted to offer s chedule, budget, and constructability input or \nfeedback to the owner.  This early involvement can be beneficial if the owner and\/or design firm do not have strong construction experience to draw upon internally.  \n AR, Tab 9, RKE Proposal at 69 (emphasis added).    Page 7 B-423394   \nThe paragraph quoted above, however, is the only place with any mention of preconstruction, and the protester has not cited to any other portion of its proposal to demonstrate that it provided \u201c[a] n acceptable discussion [identify ing] experience \nperforming preconstruction services, how preconstruction services influenced project \nsuccess, and how preconstruction services mitigated relevant risks and benefited the \nowner and\/or stakeholders ,\u201d as required by the RFP.  See  RFP at 31.  Instead, the \nremaining three paragraphs in this section of the proposal provide a general discussion of the relationships under a CMC and CMAR approach but fail to provide specific experience with a project in which RKE performed preconstruction services, their influence on the succ ess of the project, or how the services mitigated risks and provided \nbenefits to owners of and stakeholders of the project.  See generally  AR, Tab 9, RKE \nProposal at 69- 70.  We also note RKE\u2019s proposal provided less than four full pages of \nnarrative response, less than half of the 10 pages the RFP permitted for offerors to explain their construction execution approach.  Id. at 68 -71. \n After review of the agency report, RKE cites to additional sections of its proposal and argues that in addition to addressing preconstruction services generally, its proposal also addressed the preconstruction services of cost estimating, constructability,  \nidentification of construction- related problems, and value engineering.\n6  See  Comments \nat 3-6.  The protester argues that \u201c[a]t best, [the agency] can suggest that that portion of \nthe proposal focused too heavily on alternative delivery methods to the detriment of preconstruction services . . . and fails to understand the relations hip between alternative \ndelivery methods and preconstruction services.\u201d  Id. at 4.  However, as noted above, \nwhile the RFP required offerors to address their utilization of alternative delivery \nmethods and preconstruction services, the evaluation criteria emphasized that offerors \nshould \u201cdemonstrate understanding and experience in  the execution of preconstruction \nservices.\u201d  RFP at 31.  RKE failed to heed this directive at the risk of an unfavorable evaluation.  Diversified Servs. Grp., Inc., supra.  Moreov er, the language from RKE\u2019s \nproposal that it cites as examples of where it addressed preconstruction services provides limited detail and instead often simply restates solicitation requirements, which is why the agency assessed the deficiency under this factor.  \n To the extent the protester now seeks to more clearly articulate the information provided in its proposal to address preconstruction services, our review is limited to RKE\u2019s proposal as submitted.  In this regard, contracting agencies are not responsible f or \nevaluating information that is not included in a quotation or proposal.  Patriot Def . Grp., \nLLC, supra at 9.  I t was incumbent upon RKE  to submit a clear and adequate proposal \nfor evaluation and its explanation in comments  filed in a post -award protest provides no \n \n6 For example, the protester contends its proposal discussed cost estimating where it \nstated that it produces reports that \u201cat a minimum produce the basis for future design, site concepts, and well thought out construction cost estimates ,\u201d and addressed value \nengineering where it stated that having the principal contractor engaged early \u201callows the contractor to have an input in the design of the scheme and suggest value engineering changes .\u201d  Comments at 4.   Page 8 B-423394  basis to question the agency\u2019s contemporaneous evaluation of the proposal as \nsubmitted.  \n The protester also argues that the lack of detail the agency claims was absent in its proposal is an unstated evaluation criterion and otherwise insufficient to support a rating of marginal.  Protest at 15- 18.  The crux of RKE\u2019s argument is that \u201caccording to the \nRFP, merely addressing the eight challenges would result in an Acceptable rating.  There was no minimum detail threshold specified to achieve such.\u201d  Id. at 16; see also \nComments at 7 (\u201c[T]his supposed issue with details was unsupported by the RFP criteria when the RFP merely said that offerors must \u2018address\u2019 each of the eight challenges.\u201d).   \n Here, the RFP defined a rating of marginal as a proposal that \u201chas not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and\/or risk of unsuccessful performance is high.\u201d  RFP at 35.  As noted, the marginal rating assigned to RKE was  \nthe result of a deficiency, three significant weaknesses, and four weaknesses identified by the evaluators, all of which stemmed from the lack of information provided in RKE\u2019s proposal.  AR, Tab 11, RKE Consensus Evaluation Worksheet at 2.  For example, t he \nfour weaknesses stated:   \n \nThe offeror identifies the necessity for coordination efforts for access to work locations but gives very little detail  as to what that looks like.  \n The offeror does not include any details  about coordination with owners or \nstakeholders and simply states they will coordinate when necessary.  \n The offeror describes how they will comply with contractual, administrative, and regulatory requirements by simply referencing their success in past performance and t hey do not include any details  of how \nthis success is accomplished.  \n The offeror does not address specifics  on how to mitigate problems when \ndealing with emergencies, qualified labor and resource shortages, restricted access, supply chain demands, or on- site coordination.  \n Id. (emphasis added).  The RFP defined a weakness as a flaw in the proposal that \nincreases the risk of unsuccessful performance.  RFP at 35.  The RFP further defined a deficiency  as \u201ca material failure of a proposal to meet a government  requirement or a \ncombination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk  of \nunsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. \u201d  Id.   \n To the extent the protester\u2019s argument is that mere mention of each of the eight challenges was enough to earn a rating of acceptable, we do not agree.  Although the RFP stated that \u201cofferors who address each of the submission requirements as stated above will be considered acceptable,\u201d the RFP also stated that the agency would \nevaluate construction execution approach \u201con the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its  Page 9 B-423394  relevance to the work that will be required in the Solicitation.\u201d  RFP at 31.  The RFP also \ncautioned offerors that to evaluate proposals effectively and equitably, the agency had to receive \u201cinformation containing sufficient detail to allow review and evaluation by the [g]overnment.\u201d  Id. at 22.  Despite its claims that the agency ignored information in its \nproposal, the protester has not cited anything in its proposal to demonstrate that any of the weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiency identi fied by the agency are \nunreasonable.  Given the terms of the solicitation, which expressly contemplated evaluating the breadth, depth, and detail of information provided by an offeror, we find no basis to conclude that the rating of marginal is unreasonabl e, where the protester\u2019s \nproposal did not discuss certain RFP requirements like preconstruction services, and therefore did not demonstrate an \u201cadequate approach and understanding of the requirements.\u201d  Accordingly, we deny these allegations.  \n Prejudice  \n Based on our resolution of the protest grounds above, we find that RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest.  We will sustain a protest only where the protester demonstrates that but for the agency\u2019s error, it would have had a substantial chance of receiving the award.  E.g. , Technica LLC , B-417177 et \nal., Mar. 21, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 125 at 5- 7.  Where the record establishes no possibil ity \nof competitive prejudice, we will not sustain the protest even if a defect in the procurement is found.  Procentrix, Inc., B -414629, B -414629.2, Aug. 4, 2017, 2017 CPD \n\u00b6 255 at 11- 12.   \n \nHere, RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to any of its remaining protest grounds.  This includes the protester\u2019s challenges to its evaluation under the past performance and o rganization  management team factors.  Under the \nexpress terms of the RFP, a proposal that received less than an acceptable rating under a technical factor was ineligible to participate in phase two of the solicitation.  RFP at 34.  As explained above, the agency reasonably assigned RKE\u2019s proposal a rating of \nmargi nal under the construction execution approach factor, thus making RKE\u2019s proposal \nineligible for phase two of the competition and award even if it should have received higher ratings under the other factors.  Because RKE cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice with respect to its remaining protest grounds, t hey are dismissed.

Protest challenging the agency\u2019s price evaluation of the protester\u2019s quotation is denied where even though the agency unreasonably determined the protester\u2019s pricing \nwas incomplete the protester has not demonstrated it was competitively prejudiced by the agency\u2019s actions . \n 2.

Protest challenging the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation of quotations is denied where the agency reasonably evaluated quotations against the stated evaluation criteria and in an even- handed manner.  \nDECISION  \n Innovative Management and Technology Approaches, Inc. (IMTA S), a small business  of \nReston, Virginia, protests the issuance of a call order to i3, LLC,  a small business  of \nFairfax, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No.  MPO -TEM -SCO R-4, issued by \nthe Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for management  of the \nagency\u2019s information technology enterprise,  mobile device products and data plans.   \nThe protester argues that the agency  unreasonably evaluated vendors\u2019 quotations and \nthat the resultant  best-value determination and source selection decision were flawed . DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2    B-423190; B -423190.2    \nWe deny the protest . \n BACKGROUND  \n On September 20, 2024, the FBI  issued the RFQ to holders of the information \ntechnology supplies and support services (ITSSS -2) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) \npursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4.   \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1.\n1  The solicitation contemplated the \nissuance of a call order to provide professional services \u201cto support the [agency] in the \nmanagement of FBI IT [information technology] mobile device products funded and supported for the enterprise[,]\u201d with an expectation that the contractor would manage \u201cat \nleast 40,000- 50,000 mobile devices along with their inventory and carrier voice\/data \nplans.\u201d  Id .  The RFQ anticipated a 1- year base period of performance along with four 1 -\nyear options, and an additional 6- month option to extend services.  Agency Report  (AR), \nTab 3.1, RFQ at  7.  \n \nThe RFQ advised that the FBI  intended to issue the call order to the vendor whose \nquotation represented the best value to the government, and that determination of the best-value quotation would be made using a tradeoff process.  Id. at 31.  The RFQ \nprovided that in determining the best -value quotation, the agency would consider the \nfollowing factors , listed in descending order of importance:  (1) technical approach; \n(2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id.  The solicitation stated that the agency \u201cis more \nconcerned with obtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government.\u201d  Id. at 32.  \n The RFQ stated that for each non- price factor, the FBI  would assess one of the \nfollowing confidence ratings:  low confidence, some confidence, or high confidence.  Id . \nat 34.  The rating was  based on the vendor\u2019s  demonstrated ability to understand the \nrequirement, whether the vendor proposed a sound approach or demonstrated  similar \npast performance to the current requirement , and the degree to which the government \ndetermined  the vendor could be successful in performing the requirement without \ngovernment int ervention.  Id .   \n For the price factor, the RFQ instructed vendors  to complete a pricing template, \nincluding proposing labor categories necessary to meet the objectives of the solicitation and in accordance with the labor categories contained in the vendors\u2019 underlying BPA s.  \nId. at 31;  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  For each labor category \nproposed, the template required vendors to include their  fully burdened labor rates \n(FBRs) from their underlying BPAs.   AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.   \nEach vendor could then, if it desired, propose for each labor category  a percentage \ndiscount to the FBR to arrive at a quoted price rate for each labor category .  Id.  The \ntotal evaluated price would be determined by adding together the quoted price for each \n \n1 All page number citations refer to the Adobe Acrobat PDF page numbers of the \nversions of documents provided by the parties.   Page 3    B-423190; B -423190.2   labor category across the base year and all option years (including the 6- month option \nto extend services), in addition to certain fixed costs provided by the agency.  Id. at 3.    \nThe RFQ advised that price would be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  \nRFQ at 33.  With regard to completeness, quotations would be assessed base d on their \nresponsiveness in providing price data for all solicitation requirements.  To be complete, a quotation had to contain \u201call prices necessary to support the quote[,]\u201d and was required to \u201cbe accurate with no mathematical error s.\u201d  Id.    \n The FBI  received quotations from eight vendors , including IMTA S and i3.  AR, Tab 8, \nBasis of Award  at 2.  The agency \u2019s evaluation of quotations under the solicitation\u2019s \nnon-price factors yielded the following relevant results:  \n \n IMTA S i3 \nTechnical Approach  Low Confidence  High Confidence  \nCorp. Experience  Low Confidence  High Confidence  \nPrice  $5,767,769  $6,030,960  \n Id. at 6, 7.  With respect to the price factor , the FBI evaluated IMTA S\u2019s quotation for \ncompleteness and reasonableness as prescribed by the solicitation.  Though the agency determined that the protester\u2019s total evaluated price of $5,767,769 was \nreasonable, the agency also determined that the protester\u2019s pricing was \u201c incomplete. \u201d  \nAR, Tab 7, Price Report at 3.  The agency found that one of the FBR\u2019s on IMTA S\u2019s \npricing template did not match the rate in its underlying BPA across option years 1, 2, 3, 4, and the 6- month option to extend services.  Id.  Specifically, for one of t he mid- level \ndatabase administrator positions IMTAS\u2019s quotation identified an FBR that was $0.01-$0.02 less than the FBR from the underlying BPA.  See id.   As a result,  the FBI \nexcluded the protester\u2019s quotation from further consideration, and did not include it in its best-value tradeoff  determination.   AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 9.  \n Ultimately, the FBI selected i3 for the call order at a price of $6, 030,960.  The agency \nprovided a brief notice of explanation to vendors, including IMTA S, on November 12, \nand the protester subsequently timely filed this protest with our Office.   \n DISCUSSION  IMTA S raises various challenges to the FBI\u2019s evaluation of quotations and best -value \ntradeoff  determination.  See  Protest at 15- 29; Comments & Supp. Protest at 2 -21.  For \nthe reasons explained below,  although we find that the agency unreasonably evaluated \nthe protester\u2019s price quotation, we also conclude that the protest er has not established it \nwas competitively  prejudiced  in this regard and therefore deny the challenge to the price \nevaluation.  W e also deny the protester\u2019s remaining challenges .\n2 \n \n2 Though our decision does not address every argument raised by the protester, our \nOffice has considered all of them and find that none afford a basis on which to sustain \nthe protest.   Page 4    B-423190; B -423190.2    \nPrice Evaluation  \n IMTA S argues that the FBI\u2019s evaluation of the price factor was unreasonable.  As noted \nabove, the agency determined that the protester\u2019s price quotation was incomplete because the FBR for one of the labor categories did not match the labor rate in the protester\u2019s underlying BPA.  The protester contends that this decision was unreasonabl e because the mismatched labor rate was the result of  a \u201c$0.01 scrivener\u2019s \nerror in a single [s]chedule [r]ate\u201d which \u201cdid not impact the total price\u201d proposed.  Protest at 27.  Furthermore, the protester argues that the agency \u201chad all required information to ascertain the exact amount\u201d of its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  IMTA S additionally contends that the agency abused its discretion by not \npermitting IMTAS  to correct the issue through clarifications.   Protest at 27.  \n The FBI argues that the protester\u2019s quotation contained a \u201cclear and undisputable error,\u201d and that i ts determination that the protester\u2019s pricing was incomplete was because the \npricing failed to meet the clear instruction and requirements of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (M OL) at 14.  The agency contends that it was due to this \n\u201cmaterial non- compliance in the price quotation\u201d that the protester\u2019s quotation was \n\u201cremoved from the competition prior to the [a]gency\u2019s tradeoff analysis.\u201d  Id. at 16.  \nFinally, the agency argues that the solicitation did not require the agency to engage in clarifications and that, in any event, any exchanges with the protester would have resulted in quotation revisions that amounted to discussions.  Id . at 15.  \n In reviewing protests of an agency\u2019s evaluation, we do not reevaluate quotations or \nsubstitute ou r judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of quotations is a \nmatter within the agency\u2019s discretion.  DigiFlight, Inc. , B-419590, B -419590.2, May 24, \n2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 206 at 5.  Rather, we will review the record to determine if the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id .  Based on our review of the \nrecord, we find the agency unreasonably evaluat ed the protester\u2019s pricing and \nsubsequently abused its discretion in excluding the protester\u2019s quotation from the \nbest-value tradeoff analysis .  However, as discussed below, we conclude that the \nprotest er has not shown competitive prejudice with respect to this error and therefore \ndecline to sustain the protest on this basis.  \n As explained above, the RFQ required vendors to complete a pricing template, which in \npart required vendors to propose labor categories and include corresponding FBRs from \ntheir underlying BPAs.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  In this \nregard, the solicitation stated that each vendor \u201cshall populate the [FBR] [c]olumns [of the pricing template] to match the [vendor\u2019s] published [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate\u201d and that vendors could \u201capply discounts to the FBR by populating the [percent] in [the] [d]iscount [c]olumns [of the spreadsheet].\u201d   Id.  The product of the FBR and any proposed discount \nrepresented the vendor\u2019s \u201cquoted rate\u201d for a particular labor category  and accordingly \ncontributed to the vendor\u2019s total evaluated price.

The solicitation further contained general \nprovisions permitting, but not requiring, the agency to find vendors\u2019 quotations ineligible \nfor award.  For example, the RFQ stated that \u201c[f]ailure to comply with the solicitation requirements may result in the [vendor\u2019s] submission being deemed ineligible for \naward[,]\u201d and that \u201c[f]ailure to submit the information or documentation required by [the] RFQ . . . may result in the [quotation] being deemed non -compliant and rejected by the \n[g]overnment.\u201d  Id. at 28, 34.  \n IMTA S proposed two mid -level database administrator positions  as part of  its pricing for \nthe base period of performance, each option year, and the 6- month option to extend \nservices.   AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quot ation at 2.  Using the protester\u2019s  option year 1 \ndata as an example,\n3 the record reflects that one of these  positions listed an FBR of \n$124.89, and a proposed discount of  [DELETED]  percent; the resultant quoted price \nwas an hourly  rate of $ [DELETED] .  Id.  The parties agree that  the FBR and the \nresultant quoted price for this  first position are accurate .  However, for  the second \nmid-level database administrator  position, the protester \u2019s quotation id entified an FBR of \n$124.88 instead of $124.89, and a proposed discount of [DELETED]  percent .  The \nresultant quoted price was a n hourly  rate of  $[DELETED] --the same quoted rate as that \nfor IMTAS\u2019s first mid -level database administrator .  Id.  The dispute here concerns the \nFBR for the second database administrator .  It is undisputed that the correct option \nyear 1 FBR from the BPA  was $ 124.89, rather than $124.88--the error in the protester\u2019s \nquotation for the option year 1 FBR was thus in the amount of $0.01.    \n The FBI determined that, though reasonable, IMTA S\u2019s pricing was incomplete for \n\u201cfailing to provide the accurate [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate\u201d  for one of  the mid -level database \nadministrator positions  in option year 1 through the 6- month extension of services.  AR, \nTab 7, Price Report at 3.  Although the agency completed its evaluation of IMTAS\u2019s price quotation, due to this error, the FBI \u201cremoved [the quotation] from the tradeoff decision\u201d and did not further consider IMTA S for the call order.  AR, Tab 8, Basis  of \nAward at 9.  \n Under these unique circumstances, we find the FBI  unreasonably determined IMTA S\u2019s \npricing to be incomplete.   The solicitation  established the following requirements :  \n(1) vendors were required to submit pricing templates containing FBRs that matched the \nvendors\u2019 underlying BPA rates for each labor category; (2) the quoted rate for each \nlabor category , which was used to arrive at the total evaluated price,  was derived from \nthe vendors\u2019 FBR rates multiplied by any proposed discount; (3) pricing would be evaluated for completeness, including whether the quotation \u201cprovide[d] all prices \nnecessary to support the quote[,] \u201d and was free of \u201cmathematical errors\u201d; and ( 4) a \n \n3 This decision uses the data from option year 1 as an example throughout.  As \npreviously explained, option years 2, 3, and 4, and the 6- month option to extend \nservices contained similar typographical errors  with respect to the FBR , some in the \namount of $0.01 and some in the amount of $0.02.  See  AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price \nQuot ation at 2.  Page 6    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation that failed to provide the information required by the solicitation \u201cmay\u201d result in \nthe quotation being deemed ineligible for award.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ attach. 2 , Pricing \nTemplate at 1; RFQ at 33- 34. \n \nIMTA S does not dispute the fact that its quotation listed an FBR for one of its proposed \nmid-level database administrator positions  that did not match the rate on its underlying \nBPA.  Rather, the protester asserts that this error did not matter, and the FBI\u2019s subsequent determination that its proposed pricing was incomplete was unreasonable, because the error \u201cdid not factor into the calculation of the overall quoted cost at all [,]\u201d \nand that the agency otherwise had all of the information it needed to evaluate its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  In this regard, the protester maintains that the q uoted \nrate it provided for the labor category  in question was  ultimately  correct, so the agency\u2019s \nfocus on an error with the underlying BPA rate was misplaced.  Id .  We agree with \nIMTA S.   \n The basis of the FBI\u2019s  finding that IMTAS\u2019s  pricing was incomplete was that the \nprotester failed to accurately  identify the underlying rates from IMTAS\u2019s FSS BPA for \none of its two mid -level database administrator  positions.  We find the agency\u2019s \ndetermination in this regard unreasonable.   The FBR from a vendor\u2019s BPA was not  the \nbasis for the evaluation of a vendor\u2019s price, it was the \u201cquoted price,\u201d and the quoted price was based on a discount from the vendor \u2019s FBR on its BPA.   As the protester \nexplains, although one of its proposed FBRs contained a $0.01 error, its  discount rate \nadjusted by 0.01 percent arrived at the  quoted labor rate the protester intended to \npropose.   Specifically , for the first mid -level database administrator position, IMTAS  \nused the correct  FBR from its BPA  of $124.89 with a [DELETED] percent discount , \nwhich yielded a quoted pri ce of $[DELETED] .  For the second position, with the \n\u201cerroneous\u201d FBR  from its BPA of $124.88 and a [DELETED]  percent discount --as the \nprotester \u2019s pricing template provided--yield ed an identical  quoted price of $[DELETED] .  \nSee AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quotation at  2.     \n Importantly, the FBI was indisputably aware that IMTAS had submitted accurate pricing \nfor the  other identical  mid-level database administrator position, for which the protester \nincluded the correct FBR of $124.89 for option year 1.\n  For that line item, the protester\u2019s \nquoted price was a rate of $[DELETED] .  The protester\u2019s quoted price for the other \nmidlevel database administrator position, in dispute here, was also $[DELETED] .  \nDespite the incorrect underlying FBR, the quoted price matched that of the other mid-level database administrator position that the agency knew was accurate; t he \nprotester\u2019s mere typographical error for one of its positions thus cannot constitute a \nmaterial omission,  where the correct information was contained within the protester\u2019s \nquotation (on the line above the incorrect information) .  This  is particularly evident \nwhere the actual \u201cquoted price,\u201d  i.e., the price used for the evaluation, was the same for \nthe identical labor categories .   \n Consistent with the terms of the solicitation, the protester\u2019s quotation did contain \u201call prices necessary to support the quote\u201d and did not contain any actual \u201cmathematical errors .\u201d RFQ at 33.   The agency has not alleged that it could not evaluate IMTAS\u2019s price  Page 7    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation; in fact, the agency determined that the protester\u2019s overall price was \nreasonable.   \n Furthermore, the solicitation did not require the FBI  to determine IMTAS\u2019s  quotation \nineligible, instead providing that the failure to include required  information \u201cmay\u201d result in \nthe quotation being determined ineligible for award.  See RFQ at 28, 34.   In the face of \nother pricing information for the same accurate labor category, we find the agency\u2019s \ndecision to exclude the protester\u2019s quotation from the best -value tradeoff based on a \n$0.01 typographical error that had no impact on the protester\u2019s overall  quoted price to \nbe unreasonable.  However, because IMTAS cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice as a result of this error, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.  \n The intervenor argues that even if the agency erred in excluding IMTAS from the best -\nvalue tradeoff, the protester cannot show prejudice because it \u201cwould still not have had a substantial chance of receiving the award because . . . its technical and past performance ratings were substantially lower than i3\u2019s and those factors were more \nimportant than price.\u201d  Intervenor Comments at 19.  We agree.  \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency \u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial \nchance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Cargo Transport Sys. Co. , B-411646.6, B -411646.7, Oct. 17, \n2016, 2016  CPD \u00b6 294 at 9 n.14.  Based on our review of the record, IMTAS has not \ndemonstrated competitive prejudice because it has not shown that it had a substantial chance of receiving award even if the agency had accepted its price quotation and \nconsidered its quotation as part of the best -value tradeoff.  See Orbit Research, LLC , \nB-417462, July 17, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 258, at  7. \n The solicitation stated that the technical approach factor was more important than  the \npast performance factor and that both these factors were more important than price.  RFQ at 3 1.  The RFQ also informed vendors that the agency \u201cis more concerned with \nobtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government\u201d  but that the agency would not make award at a \u201csignificantly higher \noverall cost to achieve slightly superior technical skills.\u201d   Id. at 32.   \n The agency assigned IMTAS\u2019s quotation ratings of  low confidence --the lowest possible \nrating--to each of the non-price factors.  Although IMTAS challenges these ratings, as \nexplained below, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s quotation as low confidence under both the technical and past performance factors.  Accordingly, IMTAS\u2019s quotation offered the lowest ratings on the more important non- price factors \nand had a lower price than the awardee by less than five percent.  In contrast , the \nawardee i3 received ratings of high confidence--the highest possible rating--in each non-price factor with a price that was approximately  $263,200 higher than the \nprotester\u2019s price.  \n  Page 8    B-423190; B -423190.2   On this record, we conclude that the protester has not established  that the agency\u2019s \nunreasonable decision to exclude the protester from the best-value tradeoff decision \nbased on the price evaluation resulted in competitive prejudice.  In this regard, even if \nthe agency included IMTAS\u2019s quotation in the best -value determination, its low \nconfidence ratings and minimal cost savings  do not support a conclusion that IMTAS \nwould have a substantial chance of receiving award.   The solicitation provided that the \nagency was more concerned with obtaining superior technical skills than awarding at the lowest overall price.  RFQ at 32.  Here, i3\u2019s high conf idence ratings on both the non-\nprice factors indicate that its quotation demonstrated superior technical skills as compared to the low confidence ratings that IMTAS received.  Moreover, at less than a five percent premium, i3\u2019s quotation does not represent  a \u201csignificantly higher overall \ncost\u201d to achieve the superior technical skills.  Because IMTAS has not established that it \nhad a substantial chance of receiving award even with the agency\u2019s unreasonable price evaluation, w e deny this protest ground.\n  \n Technical Approach Evaluation  \n IMTA S raises various arguments challenging the FBI\u2019s evaluation of its quotation under \nthe technical approach factor.  The protester contends that the agency\u2019s assessment of a rating of low confidence under the factor was unreasonable because its quotation received \u201can equal number of areas of increased confidence and decreased confidence\u201d that should have merited a rating of at least some confidence.  Protest at 16.  The protester also argues that each of the agency\u2019s decreased confidence findings were inconsistent with the stated evaluation criteria or , in the alternative,  otherwise \ndemonstrated by its quotation.  Id . at 16- 23. \n The FBI argues that its evaluation of IMTA S\u2019s technical approach was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation, and that the protester\u2019s arguments amount to mere disagreement with its reasonable judgment.  M OL at 3.   The agency maintains \nthat the solicitation did not require the assessment of a certain confidence rating based on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings, \u201cbu t rather, the \n[g]overnment\u2019s level of confidence in the [vendors\u2019] understanding of the requirement .\u201d  \nId.; COS at 5.  Furthermore, the agency contends that the  decreased confidence \nfindings w ere not based on unstated evaluation criteria and that the protester\u2019s \narguments in the alternative, that the protester did meet the allegedly unstated requirements, should fail because the protester did not provide sufficient detail in its plan for meeting the requirements.  See MOL at 5 -8. \n Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the issuance of an order, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitat ion and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  DataSavers of \nJacksonville, Inc. , B-415113.3, Aug. 24, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 290 at 4.  Furthermore, our \nOffice has consistently stated that the evaluation of proposals and the assignment of adjectival ratin gs should not be based upon a simple count of strengths and \nweaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals consistent with the  Page 9    B-423190; B -423190.2   evaluation scheme.  Perspecta Eng\u2019g, Inc. , B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, \n2022 CPD \u00b6 314 at 10.  Adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and \nnot a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Id. \n At the outset, we find that IMTA S\u2019s argument that it should have received at least a \nrating of some confidence under the technical approach factor because its quotation was assessed an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings is meritless.  Though the protester argues i t \u201cis difficult to conceive\u201d how it could have \nreceived a rating of low confidence and that \u201cpure logic dictates\u201d that an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings merits at least a some confidence \nrating,  its argument is premised on the number of increased and decreased confidence \nfindings the agency assessed to its quotation.  Protest at 16; Comments & Supp. \nProtest at 7.  \n Notably, here the RFQ did not prescribe the assessment of a particular adjectival rating for the non- price evaluation factors  based upon the number of increased confidence or \ndecreased confidence findings that a quotation was assessed.  See  RFQ at 34.  As \nexplained above, adjectival ratings reflect  a qualitative assessment of quotations, and \nthe protester\u2019s focus on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings does not establish a basis to sustain the protest where the RFQ did not require a cer tain \nconfidence rating be assessed for a quotation containing a certain number increased or decreased confidence findings.  See Inalab Consulting, Inc. , B-422438 et al. , June 18, \n2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 145 at 7.  \n The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably assessed all three of the \ndecreased confidence findings under the technical approach factor .  Based on our \nreview of the record, we find that the agency reasonably assessed all three of the \ndecreased confidence findings .  We address a representative sample.  \n The RFQ instructed vendors to provide a written approach that demonstrated their  \nability to meet the technical requirements contained in sections three and four of the RFQ.  RFQ at 30.  This approach was to include, inter alia , a plan to support the agency \ntelecommunications expense management team and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  Id .  Sections three and four of the RFQ contained specific \nrequirements and information relating to the data capture and analysis component of the technical approach factor .  For example, the RFQ advised that the successful \ncontract or would be responsible for merging carrier data with FBI data.  RFQ at 13.   \n The FBI further clarified through solicitation questions and answers (Q&A), which were incorporated into the solicitation by amendment , certain aspects of the solicitation \nrequirement concerning vendors\u2019 approaches to improving data capture and analysis .  \nSee AR, Tab 3.6, RFQ Q&A.  For example, the agency advised that mobile \u201c [c]arriers \nprovide raw data exports that are imported into FBI systems[,]\u201d and that the successful \ncontract or would \u201cbe responsible for maintaining  the relationship with carriers in support \nof the FBI.\u201d  Id . at 2 -3.  \n  Page 10    B-423190; B -423190.2   The RFQ provided that vendors\u2019 approaches would be evaluated based on the agency\u2019s \nlevel of confidence that the proposed methods would be successful, including the clarity \nof any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  RFQ  at 32.   As explained \nabove, the RFQ provided that the technical approach factor would be assessed an adjectival rating of low, some, or high confidence based in part on the agency\u2019s \u201cconfidence that the [vendor] understands the requirement\u201d and \u201cproposes a sound approach.\u201d  Id . at 34.  \n IMTAS submitted its technical volume to include its approach to data capture and analysis.  In this regard, the protester described the platforms used to merge carrier data and included its approach to vendor management and support.  Specifically, the protester provided that it would \u201censure vendor partnerships are effectively managed[,]\u201d \nand that it would \u201chave regular interactions [with carriers] to ensure dependencies are met, services levels for data extraction are maintained[,] and identify mechanisms to enhance, automate and improve the data collection in ingestion process.\u201d  AR, Tab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Approach at 11.   The FBI assessed a decreased finding to IMTAS\u2019s technical approach, stating that \u201cIMTAS does not identify [a] relationship with carriers on how they will obtain raw data for ingestion which decreases confidence [to] support the [agency] and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  This lack of specificity decreases confidence as the vendor would not be able to support the specific carrier relationships.\u201d  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 13.  \n We find no basis to question the FBI\u2019s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in \nthis regard.  The RFQ provided that vendors were required to explain their methods and submit approaches to improving data capture and analysis, as identified in the requirements section of the solicitation.  That section explained that part of the agency\u2019s requirement involved merging carrier data with FBI data, and the questions and \nanswers  clarified both that carriers would be providing the raw data, and that the \nsuccessful contractor would be responsible for maintaining relationships with those carriers.  As the decreased confidence finding indicates, and t he contracting officer  \nfurther  explains , the protester\u2019s failure to demonstrate how it would maintain a \nrelationship with carriers regarding data capture and analysis was the contributing basis to this decreased confidence finding.  COS at  6-7; AR Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation \nat 13.  Thus, we find the agency\u2019s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in this \nregard was consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  \n Furthermore, we disagree with IMTAS\u2019s argument that its quotation in fact demonstrated the required methods and approach to improving data capture and analysis through a relationship with carriers.  In response to the protest, the contracting officer indic ates that the protester\u2019s offered approach of \u201censur[ing] vendor partnerships \nare effectively managed\u201d and \u201cleverag[ing] structured management practices\u201d and \u201cparticipat[ing] in weekly [] program meetings\u201d does not provide sufficient detail to demonstrate a plan for improving data capture and analysis requirements.  COS at 7.   Page 11    B-423190; B -423190.2   We have no basis to find  the agency\u2019s conclusion in this regard unreasonable .4  \nAccordingly, this protest ground is denied.5   \n \nPast Performance Evaluation  \n IMTA S also  challenges the FBI\u2019s past performance evaluation for both its own and i3\u2019s \nquotations.   We discuss the challenges in turn below.  \n \nIMTA S\u2019s Past Performance \n IMTA S initially contends that because it received more increased confidence findings \n(3) than decreased confidence findings  (2) under the past performance factor , the \nagency\u2019s assessment of a rating of low confidence overall was unreasonable.  Protest at 23.  The protester also challenges the FBI\u2019s specific decreased confidence findings  \nassessed to its quotation under this factor .  In this regard, the protester alleges that the \nagency faulted the protester\u2019s past performance submission for failing to demonstrate experience with \u201cSAFe [m]ethodologies,\u201d\n6 despite the solicitation not specifying such \nexperience as a requirement.  Id. at 24.  IMTAS  also contends that the agency had \ninformation \u201ctoo close at hand\u201d to ignore regarding the protester\u2019s experience with SAFe methodologies.  Id . at 25.  Finally, the protester maintains that the agency\u2019s assessment \n \n4 The protester also argues that it demonstrated the solicitation requirement through the \nexperience of one of its key personnel, a program manager.  Protest at 17.  As with the protester\u2019s  other argument, the agency explains that proposing this program manager \nand documenting his experience with \u201cvendor interaction\u201d and \u201cvendor communications\u201d is insufficient to show a plan and approach to improving data capture and analysis methods, and we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s judgment in this regard.  Protest at 17; COS at 8.   \n5 IMTAS also challenges the FBI\u2019s assessment of a decreased confidence finding for \nfailing to offer a plan or approach to increase efficiencies or reduce costs.  Protest at 20-23.  In response, the agency argues that IMTAS\u2019s quotation merely regurgitated \nsolicitation requirements, in violation of the solicitation instruction that vendors not \n\u201csimply rephrase or restate\u201d the requirements.  The contracting officer provided specific \nsections of both the RFQ and the protester\u2019s quotation as examples of where the protester merely restated RFQ requirements.  In its comments the protester restated the \nsame arguments from its protest and did not otherwise meaningfully respond to the FBI\u2019s arguments.  We therefore find this find this aspect of the protest to be abandoned.  \nSee Zin Technologies, Inc. , B-422405, B -422405.2, June 13, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 154 \nat 13 n.12 (dismissing protest ground as abandoned where protester failed to \nmeaningfully respond to specific information provided by the agency and otherwise provided a near verbatim recitation previous arguments).  \n6 \u201cSAFe\u201d refers to scaled agile framework , which is \u201can enterprise agility framework that \nhelps organizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization. \u201d  RFQ at 9 ; IntelliBridge, LLC , B-421560.9, Aug. 8, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 188 \nat 2.

Id . at 26. \n The FBI  argues that it reasonably evaluated IMTA S\u2019s past performance submission in a \nmanner consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  T he agency maintains that the \nsolicitation did not require an assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence findings, so the protester\u2019s argument that it should have received a higher rating because it had a greater number of increased confidence findings is meritless.  MOL at 9.  \n The agency further contends that the solicitation expressly required vendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies  in their past performance volumes , \nand the protester\u2019s contention otherwise is meritless.  Id . at 10.  To the extent the \nprotester argues its past performance demonstrates experience \u201cconsistent with\u201d SAFe methodologies, the agency argues this is different than meeting the solicitation\u2019s plain requirement  to show actual experience with SAFe methodologies .  Id. at 11.   Finally, the \nagency argues that it did not require vendors to submit three examples of past \nperformance, as this was contrary to the terms of the solicitation, and that it simply evaluated the examples the protester submitted.  MOL at  13; COS at 15- 16. \n Our Office will examine an agency\u2019s evaluation of an offeror\u2019s past performance and experience only to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the stated \nevaluation criteria and applicable statutes and regulations, since determining the relative merit of an offeror\u2019s past performance is primarily a matter within the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion.

The RFQ advised that \nthe examples \u201cshould demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment\u2019s requirement\u201d and that the example contracts \u201cshall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described\u201d by the solicitation.

The agency would assess an overall confidence rating \n(low, some, or high) to quotations based on its level of confidence that the vendor demonstrated it understood the requirement and showed similar past performance, and the degree to which the government had confidence that the vendor could perf orm \nwithout government intervention.  Id. at 34.   The RFQ did not require vendors to submit, \nor the agency to evaluate, any past performance reviews ( e.g., a past performance  Page 13    B-423190; B -423190.2   questionnaire or contractor performance assessment reports)  of the  quality of the work \nperformed on the example projects.  Nor did the solicitation provide for a neutral rating \nunder the past performance factor.   Accordingly, the focus of the past performance \nfactor was determining whether vendors had prior experience with t he technical \nexpertise needed for this procurement, and not on how well they had previously performed similar work.  \n IMTA S submitted three example projects in its past performance volume.  One of the \nprojects involved IMTA S\u2019s work under an order that was issued against the same BPA \nas the order contemplated by the solicitation here.

For the first decreased confidence finding, the agency explained that across all past performance examples, the protester did \u201cnot show experience practicing [SAFe] methodologies (or any project management methodology ),\u201d which lowered the agency\u2019s confidence in the protester\u2019s \nability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.  Id.  For the second decreased \nconfidence finding, the agency found that one of the protester\u2019s past performance examples discussing the work of its teaming partner WidePoint  involved WidePoint \n\u201conly provid[ing] support for 7,140 devices and 5,910 users across 13 countries,\u201d in addition to being a lower value contract than that contemplated by the solicitation.  Because the scope and value of this  example was less than the anticipated \nprocurement, it  lowered the government\u2019s confidence in the protester\u2019s ability to meet \nthe requi rements of the solicitation.  Id.  \n On this record, we find no basis to sustain the protest based on the protester\u2019s \nargument that it should have received a higher confidence rating because the agency \nassessed more findings of increased confidence than decreased confidence to the protester\u2019s quotation for past performance.  Similar to the evaluation criteria for the technical approach factor, the RFQ did not require the assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence and decreased confidence findings.  Accordingly, the argument that the agency acted unreasonably in \nassessing a rating of low confidence to the protester\u2019s quotation despite the protester \nhaving three increased confidence findings versus two decreased confidence findings, \nwithout more, is meritless.\n7  See Inalab Consulting, supra.   \n \n7 IMTAS also contends that  the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable because it \nreceived a rating of low confidence despite having some experience, whereas a vendor without any relevant experience would have received a rating of neutral.  See  Protest  \nat 23; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  As explained above, t he RFQ did not \ncontemplate a neutral rating under the past performance factor , therefore the premise of \nthe protester\u2019s argument is without a basis.   Page 14    B-423190; B -423190.2   With regard to the protester\u2019s challenges to the two decreased confidence findings, w e \nconclude that the FBI  evaluat ed IMTAS\u2019s  quotation reasonabl y and consistent with the \nstated evaluation criteria.  The protester\u2019s argument that the solicitation did not require \nvendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies is contradicted by the plain terms of the solicitation.  The RFQ required that past performance examples \nprovide clear evidence that vendors have demonstrated technical expertise in all areas identified in section 3 of the RFQ; section 3 of the RFQ stat ed that the successful \ncontractor \u201cshall perform all required program management duties,\u201d including practicing \u201c[s]caled [a]gile [f]ramework (SAFe) methodologies during contract performance.\u201d  RFQ at 12- 13.  The protester\u2019s argument that demonstration of SAFe methodologies was not \na solicitation requirement under the past performance factor is thus meritless.\n8 \n \nIMTA S collaterally argues that the FBI had information \u201ctoo close at hand\u201d to ignore \nconcerning its past performance and experience with practicing SAFe methodologies.  \nComments & Supp. Protest at 18.  In this regard, the protester argues that the first example project it submitted, which was an order issued against the same BPA as the \norder contemplated by the procurement  here, \u201cinvolved work consistent with\u201d SAFe \nmethodologies.  Id . \n Our Office has, in certain circumstances, explained that an agency \u201cmay\u201d consider past performance information that is \u201c too close  at hand\u201d to ignore in evaluating proposals.  \nVectorCSP, LLC , B-421764, B -421764.4, Sept. 27, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 229 at 9.   \nHowever, we have declined to extend the close- at-hand line of decisions beyond the \narea of past performance so as to require an agency to consider close- at-hand \ninformation in the context of an experience evaluation.  Id.   Moreover, the \u201ctoo close at \nhand\u201d line of decisions is not intended to remedy an off eror\u2019s failure to include \ninformation in its proposal.  Id.   Such circumstances are instead governed by the well -\nestablished principle that offerors are responsible for submitting a well -written proposal \n \n8 To the extent the protester argues that the solicitation unreasonably required each \nvendor to \u201c restate its entire technical volume within the text of its past performance \nvolume\u201d to show experience practicing SAFe methodologies, we find this argument is also meritless.   Protest at 25.   Under the technical approach factor, vendors were \nrequired to submit a plan and approach that included a demonstration of experience practicing SAFe methodologies.  RFQ at 32.  This requirement was in addition to at least seven other enumerated areas that the agency would review under this factor.  See id . at 32- 33.  The protester\u2019s contention that it would have to \u201c restate its entire \ntechnical volume\u201d is thus a gross mischaracterization of the solicitation\u2019s requirements.   \nComments & Supp. Protest at 17.   Furthermore, notwithstanding that the protester\u2019s \ntechnical approach discussed the use of SAFe methodologies, it did so without specific reference to an example contract  where this expertise was demonstrated.   See AR, \nTab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Volume at  8.  As explained above, the solicitation required \nexamples of demonstrated expertise in all areas of section 3 of the RFQ (including SAFe methodologies), and even in the protester\u2019s technical approach, specific examples of such expertise were not provided.    Page 15    B-423190; B -423190.2   with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the \nprocuring agency.  Id . \n We find IMTA S\u2019s argument meritless for two primary reasons.   First,  the agency made a \nfinding of decreased confidence because IMTAS did \u201cnot show experience\u201d practicing SAFe methodologies on prior contracts.  The protester argues that it did have experience working with SAFe methodologies under the same overarching BPA and that it was unreasonable for the agency to \u201cignore this \u2018close at hand\u2019 experience.\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 18.  As noted above, the \u201cclose at hand\u201d line of decisions does not extend to information in the context of an experience evaluation.  Here, although the factor was titled  \u201cpast performance, \u201d the evaluation focused on vendors \ndemonstrating their experience with different technical skills.  Given this, we conclude that the \u201ctoo close at hand\u201d decisions  do not apply here and the agency was not \nrequired to consider this experience information.  At any rate, IMTAS explained its prior experience as involving work \u201cconsistent with\u201d SAFe methodologies .  This  is different \nthan actually practic ing SAFe methodologies , which is what the solicitation required.   \n Second, the protester submitted as a past performance example the project which it claims demonstrated work consistent with SAFe methodologies.  See  AR, Tab 4.3, \nIMTA S Past Performance Volume at 3- 4.  Despite including this example and \nattempting to mirror section 3 requirements of the RFQ, the protester \u2019s quotation failed \nto demonstrate the required experience with SAFe methodologies , and otherwise failed \nto demonstrate in its quotation how its experience on the example project was consistent with SAFe methodolo gies.  Therefore, this was not a case of the agency \nfailing to consider \u201cclose at hand\u201d information, but instead represents the failure of the \nprotester to submit a well -written quotation that allowed for meaningful review by the \nagency.  See VectorCSP, LLC,  supra.  This protest ground is denied.  \n We also find the FBI\u2019s second decreased confidence finding ass essed to IMTA S\u2019s \nquotation reasonable.  As explained above, the RFQ advised that the past performance examples submitted by vendors \u201cshould demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment\u2019s requirement\u201d and that t he \nexample contracts \u201cshall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described\u201d by the solicitation.  RFQ at 33.  The third example submitted by IMTA S involved a contract performed by its teaming partner that the record \ndemonstrates was for support of only 7,140 devices and 5,910 users --well short of the \nexpected 40,000- 50,000 devices contemplated by the current order.  AR, Tab 4.3, \nIMTAS Past Performance Volume at 7; AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  Accordingly, and consistent with the evaluation criterion\u2019s requirement that examples \u201cshall be\u201d similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the present  \nrequirement, the agency\u2019s as sessment of a decreased confidence finding was \nreasonable.  \n   \nMoreover, there is nothing in the record to support IMTA S\u2019s position that the FBI \nrequired three examples of past performance in order to merit a rating of some or high confidence.  The RFQ stated that vendors could submit \u201cup to three\u201d past performance  Page 16    B-423190; B -423190.2   examples.  The protester was therefore not required, but instead elected, to submit a \nthird past performance example that fell short of the solicitation requirements for past \nperformance.   In this regard, the agency made a finding of decreased confidence \nbecause across all three examples, IMTAS failed to demonstrate experience practicing \nSAFe methodologies.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  In addition, the agency made a decreased c onfidence finding because IMTAS\u2019s third example was not similar in   \nsize, scope, and magnitude as the effort contemplated by the solicitation.  Id.   Thus, the \nrecord does not demonstrate that the FBI required three past performance examples in order to receive a rating of some or high confidence.  Rather, the record shows that the agency assessed a rating of  low confidence to IMTAS\u2019s quotation because the \nquotation did not sufficiently demonstrate the required experience in a manner that was \ncomparable to what is required for this procurement across all three of its example projects.  We find this reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria and deny \nthis protest ground.       \n  i3\u2019s Past Performance  and Disparate Treatment   \n IMTA S also challenges the FBI\u2019s evaluation of i3\u2019s past performance in various \nrespects.  In this regard, the protester argues that the record demonstrates that the FBI unreasonably considered information outside of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume in eval uating the awardee\u2019s  quotation, and that by failing to similarly consider \ninformation outside its own past performance volume, the agency engaged in disparate \ntreatment in evaluating proposals.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3- 5.  In support of its \nargument the protester points to statements in the evaluation record under the past \nperformance factor that attribute certain past performance experience to the awardee or \nits subcontractor even though the awardee or subcontractor did not perform on that respective past performance example.  The protester also contends that the agency \u201c[i]mproperly [d]ouble- [c]ounted\u201d an increased confidence finding with respect to one of \nthe awardee\u2019s past performance example projects.\n9  Id. at 6-7. \n The FBI contends that its evaluation o f i3\u2019s past performance volume was reasonable \nand adhered to the solicitation\u2019s instructions and requirements.  Supp. COS at 2.  In this \nregard, the agency explains that it \u201cdid not and could not\u201d consider information \ncontained in other volumes of the awardee\u2019s quotation as the protester argues, because \nthe solicitation precluded such consideration explaining that the solicitation provided \n \n9 The protester initially challenged the agency\u2019s evaluation of i3\u2019s past performance on \nthe basis that the awardee could not meet the solicitations\u2019 minimum size and scope requirements for past performance references.  Protest at 27- 28.  The agency report \ndiscussed the FBI\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s past performance in detail and specifically responded to the protester\u2019s argument, taking the position that the awardee\u2019s submitted examples did meet the RFQ\u2019s requirements.  MOL at 18 -19.  The \nprotester did not meaningfully respond to this particular aspect of the agency\u2019s argument, and instead filed the supplemental protest grounds explained above.  Accordingly, we consider this aspect of the protest abandoned.  See Zin Technologies, Inc., supra.   Page 17    B-423190; B -423190.2   that:  \u201cthe [g]overnment will base its evaluation only on the information presented\u201d in the \nvendors\u2019 submissions.  Id .  The agency maintains that it evaluated both vendors\u2019 \nquotations in such a manner.  Id .  With respect to the statements in the past \nperformance evaluation record that form the basis of the protester \u2019s argument , the \nagency explains that its contemporaneous evaluation documents contained minor \nerrors, but that the documents otherwise demonstrate that it evaluated the awardee\u2019s quotation based only on information contained in the awardee\u2019s past performance \nsubmission.  Id. at 3 -4.  With regard to the protester\u2019s position that the agency \nimproperly \u201cdouble counted\u201d increased confidence findings for one of the submitted projects , the agency maintains that the findings were assessed for different \nrequirements in the RFQ that the agency found were reflected in the awardee\u2019s \nperformance of that project .  Id. at 7 -8. \n Agencies must even- handedly evaluate proposals against common requirements and \nevaluation criteria.  American Sys.

Furthermore, our Office has explained that our review of \nthe record is not limited to contemporaneous evidence, and that we will also consider post-protest explanations that provide a detailed rationale for contemporaneous \nconclusions , and fill in previously unrecorded details, when those explanations are \ncredible and consistent with the contemporaneous record.

AR, Tab 5, i3 \nPast Performance Volume.  The FBI documented various increased confidence findings associated with the awardee\u2019s past performance on each of the three examples .  AR, \nTab 6, Consensus Evaluation at  9-10.  The increased confidence findings were listed in \nnumerical order , by example,  to match the example numbers submitted by the awardee.  \nSee id .  One of the findings read:  \u201cExample 1 \u2013  i\u20193\u2019s T[ier]3\/T[ier]4 personnel assisted \nusers with software, hardware.  . . .\u201d  Id. at 9.  This finding referenced the awardee, i3, \ndespite example 1 being performed by the awardee\u2019s teaming partner, 3rd  Eye.  \nCompare id. with AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5.  Another finding was \nlisted in the evaluation document between the increased confidence findings labeled as \n\u201cExample 1\u201d and \u201cExample 2.\u201d  It read:  \u201cExample 3 \u2013  3rd Eye offers custom app \narchitecture, development, testing data recovery . . . .\u201d  Id.  This finding referenced \n\u201cExample 3\u201d and \u201c3rd Eye\u201d  despite example 3 being an i3 project, and not a 3rd Eye \nproject.  Compare id.  with AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 8- 9. \n IMTAS argues that the contemporaneous past performance record reflected that the \nagency attribut ed to i3 work performed by 3rd Eye on example 1.   Comments & Supp. \nProtest at 3- 4.  Similarly, the protester contends that the agency attributed work under \nexample 3 to 3rd Eye, despite example 3 being performed by i3.   Id. at 4.  Given these \ndisparities, t he protester asserts that the only way the agency could have assessed  Page 18    B-423190; B -423190.2   increased confidence findings in this regard is if the agency improperly located the \ninformation supporting these  findings in another part of i\u20193\u2019s quotation, such as its \ntechnical approach, or from outside the awardee\u2019s quotation entirely.   Id. at 5 -6.  The \nprotester further asserts the agency\u2019s treatment of the awardee\u2019s quotation was disparate from its own, because the agency did not seek information from outside the protester\u2019s past performance volume in evaluating the protester\u2019s quotation.   Id. at 5.  \n In response to IMTAS\u2019s argument, t he contracting officer explains that the awardee\u2019s \nexample 1 project was performed by its teaming partner 3rd E ye, and that i3 was not \ninvolved.  Supp. COS at 3.  The agency explains that the increased confidence finding in question \u201cinadvertently left out the word \u2018partner\u2019 as the finding was intended to refer to 3rd Eye\u2019s experience under [ e]xample 1. \u201d  Id.  Similarly, the agency explains that for \nthe other challenged increased confidence finding, it \u201cinadvertently mistyped Example 3 when it should have [ read]  Example 1.\u201d  Id .  Notwithstanding these minor errors, the \ncontracting officer explains that the basis of each of the underlying increased confidence findings can be readily traced to the awardee\u2019s quotation.  Thus, contrary to the protester\u2019s argument, the agency  contends that it  did not consider information from \noutside of i3\u2019s past performance volume and there was no unequal treatment  of \nvendors .  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency similarly ties each of its increased confidence findings \nwith respect to i3\u2019s past performance to a section of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume.  Id . at 4 -6. \n On this record, w e find no basis to question the FBI\u2019s evaluation of quotations in this \nregard and conclude that the protester has not demonstrated the agency disparately evaluated quotations.  T he agency\u2019s post -protest explanations of the typographical \nerrors in its contemporaneous documentation are reasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  For example, it is evident that for example 1, the agency intended to refer to i3\u2019s partner, 3rd Eye.  This is supported by the two other increased confidence findings that reference 3rd Eye with respect to example 1 in the contemporaneous documentation.  See AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  Further, the substance of \nthe increased confidence finding is reflected in the awardee\u2019s quotation under the 3rd Eye example, example 1.  \n   \nSimilarly, the FBI  reasonably explains that the erroneous reference to \u201cExample 3\u201d  for \none of the increased confidence findings  should have read \u201cExample 1.\u201d  This is \nsupported by the fact that the increased confidence findings were listed in numerical order by past performance example number , and again, because the substance of the \nfinding is reflected in the awardee\u2019s past performance volume under the 3rd Eye \nexample project.  See id. ; AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5. \n On this record, we find that IMTA S cannot demonstrate that the FBI disparately \nevaluated quotations  by considering information from outside the awardee\u2019s quotation.   \nThe agency tied each of its increased confidence findings for the awardee to a relevant section of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume.  Thus, the record belies  the \nprotester\u2019s argument that the agency must have considered information outside of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume (that is,  by considering either information  Page 19    B-423190; B -423190.2   contained in the awardee\u2019s  technical approach, or through the evaluators\u2019 personal \nknowledge of i3\u2019s previous work ).  The agency\u2019s explanation that the evaluation record \ncontained some minor errors is supported by the record.  Any difference in the ratings \nassessed to the vendors\u2019 under t he past performance factor was thus plainly the result \nof the different content of their quotations, as documented by the agency.10 \n The record also demonstrates the FBI assessed two increased confidence findings to i3\u2019s quotation with respect to project example 2, a previous i3 contract.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  One of the findings was specifically for the awardee\u2019s work  \n\u201cmanaging cost data\u201d for the Department of the Interior, utilizing a \u201ccutting- edge analytic \nhub that can detect fraud[.]\u201d  Id.  The other finding, which related to the same \nDepartment of the Interior contract, was assessed because of the awardee\u2019s \u201cability to successfully manage the [] project, which has a contract value of nearly twice that [of the current requirement,]\u201d and that \u201cincrease[ d] [our] confidence in i3\u2019s ability to manage \nthe [current] program.\u201d  Id .  \n We find the FBI\u2019s assessment of the two separate increased confidence findings to i3\u2019s \npast performance example 2 was reasonable, and did not constitute a \u201cdouble counting of strength s\u201d as alleged by IMTAS.  The agency reasonably explains that the separate \nfindings were with respect to two different aspects of the solicitation\u2019s requirements.  Specifically, the agency explains that the RFQ contained a requirement for the \n \n10 In its supplemental comments, the protester raises  for the first time  various \narguments concerning the increased confidence findings assessed to the awardee\u2019s \nquotation under the past performance factor  that we find untimely .  The agency \nproduced the awardee\u2019s entire past performance volume, as well as its evaluation thereof , with its initial agency report.  The protester timely raised the arguments \ndescribed above i n its comments and supplemental protest, however, IMTAS then \nraised additional arguments for the first time in its supplemental comments concerning the content of the increased confidence findings . \nFor example, the protester argues that the awardee was assessed an increased confidence finding for its tier 3 and tier 4 personnel providing end users with troubleshooting support and response to service tickets, but that its own quotation also demonstrated these types of services yet did not receive an increased confidence finding.

We will dismiss a protester\u2019s piecemeal presentation of arguments that could \nhave been raised earlier in the protester process.  Here, the protester knew that the agency had assessed an increased confidence finding to the awardee\u2019s quotation for  \nexperience providing certain troubleshooting and end user support services when the \ninitial agency report was filed, however, it chose not to challenge this  aspect of the \nfinding until it filed its supplemental comments.

This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2    B-423190; B -423190.2    \nWe deny the protest . \n BACKGROUND  \n On September 20, 2024, the FBI  issued the RFQ to holders of the information \ntechnology supplies and support services (ITSSS -2) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) \npursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4.   \nContracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 1.\n1  The solicitation contemplated the \nissuance of a call order to provide professional services \u201cto support the [agency] in the \nmanagement of FBI IT [information technology] mobile device products funded and supported for the enterprise[,]\u201d with an expectation that the contractor would manage \u201cat \nleast 40,000- 50,000 mobile devices along with their inventory and carrier voice\/data \nplans.\u201d  Id .  The RFQ anticipated a 1- year base period of performance along with four 1 -\nyear options, and an additional 6- month option to extend services.  Agency Report  (AR), \nTab 3.1, RFQ at  7.  \n \nThe RFQ advised that the FBI  intended to issue the call order to the vendor whose \nquotation represented the best value to the government, and that determination of the best-value quotation would be made using a tradeoff process.  Id. at 31.  The RFQ \nprovided that in determining the best -value quotation, the agency would consider the \nfollowing factors , listed in descending order of importance:  (1) technical approach; \n(2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id.  The solicitation stated that the agency \u201cis more \nconcerned with obtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government.\u201d  Id. at 32.  \n The RFQ stated that for each non- price factor, the FBI  would assess one of the \nfollowing confidence ratings:  low confidence, some confidence, or high confidence.  Id . \nat 34.  The rating was  based on the vendor\u2019s  demonstrated ability to understand the \nrequirement, whether the vendor proposed a sound approach or demonstrated  similar \npast performance to the current requirement , and the degree to which the government \ndetermined  the vendor could be successful in performing the requirement without \ngovernment int ervention.  Id .   \n For the price factor, the RFQ instructed vendors  to complete a pricing template, \nincluding proposing labor categories necessary to meet the objectives of the solicitation and in accordance with the labor categories contained in the vendors\u2019 underlying BPA s.  \nId. at 31;  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  For each labor category \nproposed, the template required vendors to include their  fully burdened labor rates \n(FBRs) from their underlying BPAs.   AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.   \nEach vendor could then, if it desired, propose for each labor category  a percentage \ndiscount to the FBR to arrive at a quoted price rate for each labor category .  Id.  The \ntotal evaluated price would be determined by adding together the quoted price for each \n \n1 All page number citations refer to the Adobe Acrobat PDF page numbers of the \nversions of documents provided by the parties.   Page 3    B-423190; B -423190.2   labor category across the base year and all option years (including the 6- month option \nto extend services), in addition to certain fixed costs provided by the agency.  Id. at 3.    \nThe RFQ advised that price would be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  \nRFQ at 33.  With regard to completeness, quotations would be assessed base d on their \nresponsiveness in providing price data for all solicitation requirements.  To be complete, a quotation had to contain \u201call prices necessary to support the quote[,]\u201d and was required to \u201cbe accurate with no mathematical error s.\u201d  Id.    \n The FBI  received quotations from eight vendors , including IMTA S and i3.  AR, Tab 8, \nBasis of Award  at 2.  The agency \u2019s evaluation of quotations under the solicitation\u2019s \nnon-price factors yielded the following relevant results:  \n \n IMTA S i3 \nTechnical Approach  Low Confidence  High Confidence  \nCorp. Experience  Low Confidence  High Confidence  \nPrice  $5,767,769  $6,030,960  \n Id. at 6, 7.  With respect to the price factor , the FBI evaluated IMTA S\u2019s quotation for \ncompleteness and reasonableness as prescribed by the solicitation.  Though the agency determined that the protester\u2019s total evaluated price of $5,767,769 was \nreasonable, the agency also determined that the protester\u2019s pricing was \u201c incomplete. \u201d  \nAR, Tab 7, Price Report at 3.  The agency found that one of the FBR\u2019s on IMTA S\u2019s \npricing template did not match the rate in its underlying BPA across option years 1, 2, 3, 4, and the 6- month option to extend services.  Id.  Specifically, for one of t he mid- level \ndatabase administrator positions IMTAS\u2019s quotation identified an FBR that was $0.01-$0.02 less than the FBR from the underlying BPA.  See id.   As a result,  the FBI \nexcluded the protester\u2019s quotation from further consideration, and did not include it in its best-value tradeoff  determination.   AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 9.  \n Ultimately, the FBI selected i3 for the call order at a price of $6, 030,960.  The agency \nprovided a brief notice of explanation to vendors, including IMTA S, on November 12, \nand the protester subsequently timely filed this protest with our Office.   \n DISCUSSION  IMTA S raises various challenges to the FBI\u2019s evaluation of quotations and best -value \ntradeoff  determination.  See  Protest at 15- 29; Comments & Supp. Protest at 2 -21.  For \nthe reasons explained below,  although we find that the agency unreasonably evaluated \nthe protester\u2019s price quotation, we also conclude that the protest er has not established it \nwas competitively  prejudiced  in this regard and therefore deny the challenge to the price \nevaluation.  W e also deny the protester\u2019s remaining challenges .\n2 \n \n2 Though our decision does not address every argument raised by the protester, our \nOffice has considered all of them and find that none afford a basis on which to sustain \nthe protest.   Page 4    B-423190; B -423190.2    \nPrice Evaluation  \n IMTA S argues that the FBI\u2019s evaluation of the price factor was unreasonable.  As noted \nabove, the agency determined that the protester\u2019s price quotation was incomplete because the FBR for one of the labor categories did not match the labor rate in the protester\u2019s underlying BPA.  The protester contends that this decision was unreasonabl e because the mismatched labor rate was the result of  a \u201c$0.01 scrivener\u2019s \nerror in a single [s]chedule [r]ate\u201d which \u201cdid not impact the total price\u201d proposed.  Protest at 27.  Furthermore, the protester argues that the agency \u201chad all required information to ascertain the exact amount\u201d of its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  IMTA S additionally contends that the agency abused its discretion by not \npermitting IMTAS  to correct the issue through clarifications.   Protest at 27.  \n The FBI argues that the protester\u2019s quotation contained a \u201cclear and undisputable error,\u201d and that i ts determination that the protester\u2019s pricing was incomplete was because the \npricing failed to meet the clear instruction and requirements of the solicitation.  Memorandum of Law (M OL) at 14.  The agency contends that it was due to this \n\u201cmaterial non- compliance in the price quotation\u201d that the protester\u2019s quotation was \n\u201cremoved from the competition prior to the [a]gency\u2019s tradeoff analysis.\u201d  Id. at 16.  \nFinally, the agency argues that the solicitation did not require the agency to engage in clarifications and that, in any event, any exchanges with the protester would have resulted in quotation revisions that amounted to discussions.  Id . at 15.  \n In reviewing protests of an agency\u2019s evaluation, we do not reevaluate quotations or \nsubstitute ou r judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of quotations is a \nmatter within the agency\u2019s discretion.  DigiFlight, Inc. , B-419590, B -419590.2, May 24, \n2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 206 at 5.  Rather, we will review the record to determine if the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id .  Based on our review of the \nrecord, we find the agency unreasonably evaluat ed the protester\u2019s pricing and \nsubsequently abused its discretion in excluding the protester\u2019s quotation from the \nbest-value tradeoff analysis .  However, as discussed below, we conclude that the \nprotest er has not shown competitive prejudice with respect to this error and therefore \ndecline to sustain the protest on this basis.  \n As explained above, the RFQ required vendors to complete a pricing template, which in \npart required vendors to propose labor categories and include corresponding FBRs from \ntheir underlying BPAs.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ  attach. 2,  Pricing Template at 1.  In this \nregard, the solicitation stated that each vendor \u201cshall populate the [FBR] [c]olumns [of the pricing template] to match the [vendor\u2019s] published [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate\u201d and that vendors could \u201capply discounts to the FBR by populating the [percent] in [the] [d]iscount [c]olumns [of the spreadsheet].\u201d   Id.  The product of the FBR and any proposed discount \nrepresented the vendor\u2019s \u201cquoted rate\u201d for a particular labor category  and accordingly \ncontributed to the vendor\u2019s total evaluated price.   See  id at 2.   \n  Page 5    B-423190; B -423190.2   The agency would evaluate v endors\u2019 pricing for completeness and reasonableness  in \nthe manner described above.  RFQ  at 33.  The solicitation further contained general \nprovisions permitting, but not requiring, the agency to find vendors\u2019 quotations ineligible \nfor award.  For example, the RFQ stated that \u201c[f]ailure to comply with the solicitation requirements may result in the [vendor\u2019s] submission being deemed ineligible for \naward[,]\u201d and that \u201c[f]ailure to submit the information or documentation required by [the] RFQ . . . may result in the [quotation] being deemed non -compliant and rejected by the \n[g]overnment.\u201d  Id. at 28, 34.  \n IMTA S proposed two mid -level database administrator positions  as part of  its pricing for \nthe base period of performance, each option year, and the 6- month option to extend \nservices.   AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quot ation at 2.  Using the protester\u2019s  option year 1 \ndata as an example,\n3 the record reflects that one of these  positions listed an FBR of \n$124.89, and a proposed discount of  [DELETED]  percent; the resultant quoted price \nwas an hourly  rate of $ [DELETED] .  Id.  The parties agree that  the FBR and the \nresultant quoted price for this  first position are accurate .  However, for  the second \nmid-level database administrator  position, the protester \u2019s quotation id entified an FBR of \n$124.88 instead of $124.89, and a proposed discount of [DELETED]  percent .  The \nresultant quoted price was a n hourly  rate of  $[DELETED] --the same quoted rate as that \nfor IMTAS\u2019s first mid -level database administrator .  Id.  The dispute here concerns the \nFBR for the second database administrator .  It is undisputed that the correct option \nyear 1 FBR from the BPA  was $ 124.89, rather than $124.88--the error in the protester\u2019s \nquotation for the option year 1 FBR was thus in the amount of $0.01.    \n The FBI determined that, though reasonable, IMTA S\u2019s pricing was incomplete for \n\u201cfailing to provide the accurate [BPA] [s]chedule [r]ate\u201d  for one of  the mid -level database \nadministrator positions  in option year 1 through the 6- month extension of services.  AR, \nTab 7, Price Report at 3.  Although the agency completed its evaluation of IMTAS\u2019s price quotation, due to this error, the FBI \u201cremoved [the quotation] from the tradeoff decision\u201d and did not further consider IMTA S for the call order.  AR, Tab 8, Basis  of \nAward at 9.  \n Under these unique circumstances, we find the FBI  unreasonably determined IMTA S\u2019s \npricing to be incomplete.   The solicitation  established the following requirements :  \n(1) vendors were required to submit pricing templates containing FBRs that matched the \nvendors\u2019 underlying BPA rates for each labor category; (2) the quoted rate for each \nlabor category , which was used to arrive at the total evaluated price,  was derived from \nthe vendors\u2019 FBR rates multiplied by any proposed discount; (3) pricing would be evaluated for completeness, including whether the quotation \u201cprovide[d] all prices \nnecessary to support the quote[,] \u201d and was free of \u201cmathematical errors\u201d; and ( 4) a \n \n3 This decision uses the data from option year 1 as an example throughout.  As \npreviously explained, option years 2, 3, and 4, and the 6- month option to extend \nservices contained similar typographical errors  with respect to the FBR , some in the \namount of $0.01 and some in the amount of $0.02.  See  AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price \nQuot ation at 2.  Page 6    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation that failed to provide the information required by the solicitation \u201cmay\u201d result in \nthe quotation being deemed ineligible for award.  AR, Tab 3.3, RFQ attach. 2 , Pricing \nTemplate at 1; RFQ at 33- 34. \n \nIMTA S does not dispute the fact that its quotation listed an FBR for one of its proposed \nmid-level database administrator positions  that did not match the rate on its underlying \nBPA.  Rather, the protester asserts that this error did not matter, and the FBI\u2019s subsequent determination that its proposed pricing was incomplete was unreasonable, because the error \u201cdid not factor into the calculation of the overall quoted cost at all [,]\u201d \nand that the agency otherwise had all of the information it needed to evaluate its pricing.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 20.  In this regard, the protester maintains that the q uoted \nrate it provided for the labor category  in question was  ultimately  correct, so the agency\u2019s \nfocus on an error with the underlying BPA rate was misplaced.  Id .  We agree with \nIMTA S.   \n The basis of the FBI\u2019s  finding that IMTAS\u2019s  pricing was incomplete was that the \nprotester failed to accurately  identify the underlying rates from IMTAS\u2019s FSS BPA for \none of its two mid -level database administrator  positions.  We find the agency\u2019s \ndetermination in this regard unreasonable.   The FBR from a vendor\u2019s BPA was not  the \nbasis for the evaluation of a vendor\u2019s price, it was the \u201cquoted price,\u201d and the quoted price was based on a discount from the vendor \u2019s FBR on its BPA.   As the protester \nexplains, although one of its proposed FBRs contained a $0.01 error, its  discount rate \nadjusted by 0.01 percent arrived at the  quoted labor rate the protester intended to \npropose.   Specifically , for the first mid -level database administrator position, IMTAS  \nused the correct  FBR from its BPA  of $124.89 with a [DELETED] percent discount , \nwhich yielded a quoted pri ce of $[DELETED] .  For the second position, with the \n\u201cerroneous\u201d FBR  from its BPA of $124.88 and a [DELETED]  percent discount --as the \nprotester \u2019s pricing template provided--yield ed an identical  quoted price of $[DELETED] .  \nSee AR, Tab 4.4, IMTAS Price Quotation at  2.     \n Importantly, the FBI was indisputably aware that IMTAS had submitted accurate pricing \nfor the  other identical  mid-level database administrator position, for which the protester \nincluded the correct FBR of $124.89 for option year 1.\n  For that line item, the protester\u2019s \nquoted price was a rate of $[DELETED] .  The protester\u2019s quoted price for the other \nmidlevel database administrator position, in dispute here, was also $[DELETED] .  \nDespite the incorrect underlying FBR, the quoted price matched that of the other mid-level database administrator position that the agency knew was accurate; t he \nprotester\u2019s mere typographical error for one of its positions thus cannot constitute a \nmaterial omission,  where the correct information was contained within the protester\u2019s \nquotation (on the line above the incorrect information) .  This  is particularly evident \nwhere the actual \u201cquoted price,\u201d  i.e., the price used for the evaluation, was the same for \nthe identical labor categories .   \n Consistent with the terms of the solicitation, the protester\u2019s quotation did contain \u201call prices necessary to support the quote\u201d and did not contain any actual \u201cmathematical errors .\u201d RFQ at 33.   The agency has not alleged that it could not evaluate IMTAS\u2019s price  Page 7    B-423190; B -423190.2   quotation; in fact, the agency determined that the protester\u2019s overall price was \nreasonable.   \n Furthermore, the solicitation did not require the FBI  to determine IMTAS\u2019s  quotation \nineligible, instead providing that the failure to include required  information \u201cmay\u201d result in \nthe quotation being determined ineligible for award.  See RFQ at 28, 34.   In the face of \nother pricing information for the same accurate labor category, we find the agency\u2019s \ndecision to exclude the protester\u2019s quotation from the best -value tradeoff based on a \n$0.01 typographical error that had no impact on the protester\u2019s overall  quoted price to \nbe unreasonable.  However, because IMTAS cannot demonstrate competitive prejudice as a result of this error, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.  \n The intervenor argues that even if the agency erred in excluding IMTAS from the best -\nvalue tradeoff, the protester cannot show prejudice because it \u201cwould still not have had a substantial chance of receiving the award because . . . its technical and past performance ratings were substantially lower than i3\u2019s and those factors were more \nimportant than price.\u201d  Intervenor Comments at 19.  We agree.  \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of a viable protest; where the protester fails to demonstrate that, but for the agency \u2019s actions, it would have had a substantial \nchance of receiving the award, there is no basis for finding prejudice, and our Office will not sustain the protest.  Cargo Transport Sys. Co. , B-411646.6, B -411646.7, Oct. 17, \n2016, 2016  CPD \u00b6 294 at 9 n.14.  Based on our review of the record, IMTAS has not \ndemonstrated competitive prejudice because it has not shown that it had a substantial chance of receiving award even if the agency had accepted its price quotation and \nconsidered its quotation as part of the best -value tradeoff.  See Orbit Research, LLC , \nB-417462, July 17, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 258, at  7. \n The solicitation stated that the technical approach factor was more important than  the \npast performance factor and that both these factors were more important than price.  RFQ at 3 1.  The RFQ also informed vendors that the agency \u201cis more concerned with \nobtaining superior technical skills than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government\u201d  but that the agency would not make award at a \u201csignificantly higher \noverall cost to achieve slightly superior technical skills.\u201d   Id. at 32.   \n The agency assigned IMTAS\u2019s quotation ratings of  low confidence --the lowest possible \nrating--to each of the non-price factors.  Although IMTAS challenges these ratings, as \nexplained below, we find that the agency reasonably evaluated the protester\u2019s quotation as low confidence under both the technical and past performance factors.  Accordingly, IMTAS\u2019s quotation offered the lowest ratings on the more important non- price factors \nand had a lower price than the awardee by less than five percent.  In contrast , the \nawardee i3 received ratings of high confidence--the highest possible rating--in each non-price factor with a price that was approximately  $263,200 higher than the \nprotester\u2019s price.  \n  Page 8    B-423190; B -423190.2   On this record, we conclude that the protester has not established  that the agency\u2019s \nunreasonable decision to exclude the protester from the best-value tradeoff decision \nbased on the price evaluation resulted in competitive prejudice.  In this regard, even if \nthe agency included IMTAS\u2019s quotation in the best -value determination, its low \nconfidence ratings and minimal cost savings  do not support a conclusion that IMTAS \nwould have a substantial chance of receiving award.   The solicitation provided that the \nagency was more concerned with obtaining superior technical skills than awarding at the lowest overall price.  RFQ at 32.  Here, i3\u2019s high conf idence ratings on both the non-\nprice factors indicate that its quotation demonstrated superior technical skills as compared to the low confidence ratings that IMTAS received.  Moreover, at less than a five percent premium, i3\u2019s quotation does not represent  a \u201csignificantly higher overall \ncost\u201d to achieve the superior technical skills.  Because IMTAS has not established that it \nhad a substantial chance of receiving award even with the agency\u2019s unreasonable price evaluation, w e deny this protest ground.\n  \n Technical Approach Evaluation  \n IMTA S raises various arguments challenging the FBI\u2019s evaluation of its quotation under \nthe technical approach factor.  The protester contends that the agency\u2019s assessment of a rating of low confidence under the factor was unreasonable because its quotation received \u201can equal number of areas of increased confidence and decreased confidence\u201d that should have merited a rating of at least some confidence.  Protest at 16.  The protester also argues that each of the agency\u2019s decreased confidence findings were inconsistent with the stated evaluation criteria or , in the alternative,  otherwise \ndemonstrated by its quotation.  Id . at 16- 23. \n The FBI argues that its evaluation of IMTA S\u2019s technical approach was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation, and that the protester\u2019s arguments amount to mere disagreement with its reasonable judgment.  M OL at 3.   The agency maintains \nthat the solicitation did not require the assessment of a certain confidence rating based on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings, \u201cbu t rather, the \n[g]overnment\u2019s level of confidence in the [vendors\u2019] understanding of the requirement .\u201d  \nId.; COS at 5.  Furthermore, the agency contends that the  decreased confidence \nfindings w ere not based on unstated evaluation criteria and that the protester\u2019s \narguments in the alternative, that the protester did meet the allegedly unstated requirements, should fail because the protester did not provide sufficient detail in its plan for meeting the requirements.  See MOL at 5 -8. \n Where, as here, an agency issues an RFQ to vendors under FAR subpart 8.4 and conducts a competition for the issuance of an order, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitat ion and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  DataSavers of \nJacksonville, Inc. , B-415113.3, Aug. 24, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 290 at 4.  Furthermore, our \nOffice has consistently stated that the evaluation of proposals and the assignment of adjectival ratin gs should not be based upon a simple count of strengths and \nweaknesses, but upon a qualitative assessment of the proposals consistent with the  Page 9    B-423190; B -423190.2   evaluation scheme.  Perspecta Eng\u2019g, Inc. , B-420501.2, B -420501.3, Dec. 13, 2022, \n2022 CPD \u00b6 314 at 10.  Adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and \nnot a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Id. \n At the outset, we find that IMTA S\u2019s argument that it should have received at least a \nrating of some confidence under the technical approach factor because its quotation was assessed an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings is meritless.  Though the protester argues i t \u201cis difficult to conceive\u201d how it could have \nreceived a rating of low confidence and that \u201cpure logic dictates\u201d that an equal number of increased and decreased confidence findings merits at least a some confidence \nrating,  its argument is premised on the number of increased and decreased confidence \nfindings the agency assessed to its quotation.  Protest at 16; Comments & Supp. \nProtest at 7.  \n Notably, here the RFQ did not prescribe the assessment of a particular adjectival rating for the non- price evaluation factors  based upon the number of increased confidence or \ndecreased confidence findings that a quotation was assessed.  See  RFQ at 34.  As \nexplained above, adjectival ratings reflect  a qualitative assessment of quotations, and \nthe protester\u2019s focus on the number of increased and decreased confidence findings does not establish a basis to sustain the protest where the RFQ did not require a cer tain \nconfidence rating be assessed for a quotation containing a certain number increased or decreased confidence findings.  See Inalab Consulting, Inc. , B-422438 et al. , June 18, \n2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 145 at 7.  \n The protester also alleges that the agency unreasonably assessed all three of the \ndecreased confidence findings under the technical approach factor .  Based on our \nreview of the record, we find that the agency reasonably assessed all three of the \ndecreased confidence findings .  We address a representative sample.  \n The RFQ instructed vendors to provide a written approach that demonstrated their  \nability to meet the technical requirements contained in sections three and four of the RFQ.  RFQ at 30.  This approach was to include, inter alia , a plan to support the agency \ntelecommunications expense management team and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  Id .  Sections three and four of the RFQ contained specific \nrequirements and information relating to the data capture and analysis component of the technical approach factor .  For example, the RFQ advised that the successful \ncontract or would be responsible for merging carrier data with FBI data.  RFQ at 13.   \n The FBI further clarified through solicitation questions and answers (Q&A), which were incorporated into the solicitation by amendment , certain aspects of the solicitation \nrequirement concerning vendors\u2019 approaches to improving data capture and analysis .  \nSee AR, Tab 3.6, RFQ Q&A.  For example, the agency advised that mobile \u201c [c]arriers \nprovide raw data exports that are imported into FBI systems[,]\u201d and that the successful \ncontract or would \u201cbe responsible for maintaining  the relationship with carriers in support \nof the FBI.\u201d  Id . at 2 -3.  \n  Page 10    B-423190; B -423190.2   The RFQ provided that vendors\u2019 approaches would be evaluated based on the agency\u2019s \nlevel of confidence that the proposed methods would be successful, including the clarity \nof any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  RFQ  at 32.   As explained \nabove, the RFQ provided that the technical approach factor would be assessed an adjectival rating of low, some, or high confidence based in part on the agency\u2019s \u201cconfidence that the [vendor] understands the requirement\u201d and \u201cproposes a sound approach.\u201d  Id . at 34.  \n IMTAS submitted its technical volume to include its approach to data capture and analysis.  In this regard, the protester described the platforms used to merge carrier data and included its approach to vendor management and support.  Specifically, the protester provided that it would \u201censure vendor partnerships are effectively managed[,]\u201d \nand that it would \u201chave regular interactions [with carriers] to ensure dependencies are met, services levels for data extraction are maintained[,] and identify mechanisms to enhance, automate and improve the data collection in ingestion process.\u201d  AR, Tab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Approach at 11.   The FBI assessed a decreased finding to IMTAS\u2019s technical approach, stating that \u201cIMTAS does not identify [a] relationship with carriers on how they will obtain raw data for ingestion which decreases confidence [to] support the [agency] and any approaches to improving data capture and analysis.  This lack of specificity decreases confidence as the vendor would not be able to support the specific carrier relationships.\u201d  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 13.  \n We find no basis to question the FBI\u2019s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in \nthis regard.  The RFQ provided that vendors were required to explain their methods and submit approaches to improving data capture and analysis, as identified in the requirements section of the solicitation.  That section explained that part of the agency\u2019s requirement involved merging carrier data with FBI data, and the questions and \nanswers  clarified both that carriers would be providing the raw data, and that the \nsuccessful contractor would be responsible for maintaining relationships with those carriers.  As the decreased confidence finding indicates, and t he contracting officer  \nfurther  explains , the protester\u2019s failure to demonstrate how it would maintain a \nrelationship with carriers regarding data capture and analysis was the contributing basis to this decreased confidence finding.  COS at  6-7; AR Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation \nat 13.  Thus, we find the agency\u2019s assessment of a decreased confidence finding in this \nregard was consistent with the stated evaluation criteria.  \n Furthermore, we disagree with IMTAS\u2019s argument that its quotation in fact demonstrated the required methods and approach to improving data capture and analysis through a relationship with carriers.  In response to the protest, the contracting officer indic ates that the protester\u2019s offered approach of \u201censur[ing] vendor partnerships \nare effectively managed\u201d and \u201cleverag[ing] structured management practices\u201d and \u201cparticipat[ing] in weekly [] program meetings\u201d does not provide sufficient detail to demonstrate a plan for improving data capture and analysis requirements.  COS at 7.   Page 11    B-423190; B -423190.2   We have no basis to find  the agency\u2019s conclusion in this regard unreasonable .4  \nAccordingly, this protest ground is denied.5   \n \nPast Performance Evaluation  \n IMTA S also  challenges the FBI\u2019s past performance evaluation for both its own and i3\u2019s \nquotations.   We discuss the challenges in turn below.  \n \nIMTA S\u2019s Past Performance \n IMTA S initially contends that because it received more increased confidence findings \n(3) than decreased confidence findings  (2) under the past performance factor , the \nagency\u2019s assessment of a rating of low confidence overall was unreasonable.  Protest at 23.  The protester also challenges the FBI\u2019s specific decreased confidence findings  \nassessed to its quotation under this factor .  In this regard, the protester alleges that the \nagency faulted the protester\u2019s past performance submission for failing to demonstrate experience with \u201cSAFe [m]ethodologies,\u201d\n6 despite the solicitation not specifying such \nexperience as a requirement.  Id. at 24.  IMTAS  also contends that the agency had \ninformation \u201ctoo close at hand\u201d to ignore regarding the protester\u2019s experience with SAFe methodologies.  Id . at 25.  Finally, the protester maintains that the agency\u2019s assessment \n \n4 The protester also argues that it demonstrated the solicitation requirement through the \nexperience of one of its key personnel, a program manager.  Protest at 17.  As with the protester\u2019s  other argument, the agency explains that proposing this program manager \nand documenting his experience with \u201cvendor interaction\u201d and \u201cvendor communications\u201d is insufficient to show a plan and approach to improving data capture and analysis methods, and we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s judgment in this regard.  Protest at 17; COS at 8.   \n5 IMTAS also challenges the FBI\u2019s assessment of a decreased confidence finding for \nfailing to offer a plan or approach to increase efficiencies or reduce costs.  Protest at 20-23.  In response, the agency argues that IMTAS\u2019s quotation merely regurgitated \nsolicitation requirements, in violation of the solicitation instruction that vendors not \n\u201csimply rephrase or restate\u201d the requirements.  The contracting officer provided specific \nsections of both the RFQ and the protester\u2019s quotation as examples of where the protester merely restated RFQ requirements.  In its comments the protester restated the \nsame arguments from its protest and did not otherwise meaningfully respond to the FBI\u2019s arguments.  We therefore find this find this aspect of the protest to be abandoned.  \nSee Zin Technologies, Inc. , B-422405, B -422405.2, June 13, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 154 \nat 13 n.12 (dismissing protest ground as abandoned where protester failed to \nmeaningfully respond to specific information provided by the agency and otherwise provided a near verbatim recitation previous arguments).  \n6 \u201cSAFe\u201d refers to scaled agile framework , which is \u201can enterprise agility framework that \nhelps organizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization. \u201d  RFQ at 9 ; IntelliBridge, LLC , B-421560.9, Aug. 8, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 188 \nat 2.

Id . at 26. \n The FBI  argues that it reasonably evaluated IMTA S\u2019s past performance submission in a \nmanner consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  T he agency maintains that the \nsolicitation did not require an assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence findings, so the protester\u2019s argument that it should have received a higher rating because it had a greater number of increased confidence findings is meritless.  MOL at 9.  \n The agency further contends that the solicitation expressly required vendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies  in their past performance volumes , \nand the protester\u2019s contention otherwise is meritless.  Id . at 10.  To the extent the \nprotester argues its past performance demonstrates experience \u201cconsistent with\u201d SAFe methodologies, the agency argues this is different than meeting the solicitation\u2019s plain requirement  to show actual experience with SAFe methodologies .  Id. at 11.   Finally, the \nagency argues that it did not require vendors to submit three examples of past \nperformance, as this was contrary to the terms of the solicitation, and that it simply evaluated the examples the protester submitted.  MOL at  13; COS at 15- 16. \n Our Office will examine an agency\u2019s evaluation of an offeror\u2019s past performance and experience only to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the stated \nevaluation criteria and applicable statutes and regulations, since determining the relative merit of an offeror\u2019s past performance is primarily a matter within the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion.

RFQ at 30.  The RFQ advised that \nthe examples \u201cshould demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment\u2019s requirement\u201d and that the example contracts \u201cshall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described\u201d by the solicitation.  Id . at 33.  The examples submitted were to \u201cprovide clear \nevidence\u201d that the vendor has demonstrated technical expertise \u201cin all areas identified in [] [s]ection 3 [of the RFQ].\u201d  Id .  The agency would assess an overall confidence rating \n(low, some, or high) to quotations based on its level of confidence that the vendor demonstrated it understood the requirement and showed similar past performance, and the degree to which the government had confidence that the vendor could perf orm \nwithout government intervention.  Id. at 34.   The RFQ did not require vendors to submit, \nor the agency to evaluate, any past performance reviews ( e.g., a past performance  Page 13    B-423190; B -423190.2   questionnaire or contractor performance assessment reports)  of the  quality of the work \nperformed on the example projects.  Nor did the solicitation provide for a neutral rating \nunder the past performance factor.   Accordingly, the focus of the past performance \nfactor was determining whether vendors had prior experience with t he technical \nexpertise needed for this procurement, and not on how well they had previously performed similar work.  \n IMTA S submitted three example projects in its past performance volume.  One of the \nprojects involved IMTA S\u2019s work under an order that was issued against the same BPA \nas the order contemplated by the solicitation here.  AR, Tab 4.3, IMTA S Past \nPerformance Volume at 3- 4.  The other two examples concerned work performed by \nIMTA S\u2019s teaming partner, WidePoint.  Id . at 5 -8.  \n In its evaluation of IMTA S\u2019s past performance, the FBI documented three findings that \nincreased confidence in the protester\u2019s quotation, and two findings that decreased confidence.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  For the first decreased confidence finding, the agency explained that across all past performance examples, the protester did \u201cnot show experience practicing [SAFe] methodologies (or any project management methodology ),\u201d which lowered the agency\u2019s confidence in the protester\u2019s \nability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.  Id.  For the second decreased \nconfidence finding, the agency found that one of the protester\u2019s past performance examples discussing the work of its teaming partner WidePoint  involved WidePoint \n\u201conly provid[ing] support for 7,140 devices and 5,910 users across 13 countries,\u201d in addition to being a lower value contract than that contemplated by the solicitation.  Because the scope and value of this  example was less than the anticipated \nprocurement, it  lowered the government\u2019s confidence in the protester\u2019s ability to meet \nthe requi rements of the solicitation.  Id.  \n On this record, we find no basis to sustain the protest based on the protester\u2019s \nargument that it should have received a higher confidence rating because the agency \nassessed more findings of increased confidence than decreased confidence to the protester\u2019s quotation for past performance.  Similar to the evaluation criteria for the technical approach factor, the RFQ did not require the assessment of a particular confidence rating based on the number of increased confidence and decreased confidence findings.  Accordingly, the argument that the agency acted unreasonably in \nassessing a rating of low confidence to the protester\u2019s quotation despite the protester \nhaving three increased confidence findings versus two decreased confidence findings, \nwithout more, is meritless.\n7  See Inalab Consulting, supra.   \n \n7 IMTAS also contends that  the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable because it \nreceived a rating of low confidence despite having some experience, whereas a vendor without any relevant experience would have received a rating of neutral.  See  Protest  \nat 23; Comments & Supp. Protest at 15- 16.  As explained above, t he RFQ did not \ncontemplate a neutral rating under the past performance factor , therefore the premise of \nthe protester\u2019s argument is without a basis.   Page 14    B-423190; B -423190.2   With regard to the protester\u2019s challenges to the two decreased confidence findings, w e \nconclude that the FBI  evaluat ed IMTAS\u2019s  quotation reasonabl y and consistent with the \nstated evaluation criteria.  The protester\u2019s argument that the solicitation did not require \nvendors to demonstrate experience with SAFe methodologies is contradicted by the plain terms of the solicitation.  The RFQ required that past performance examples \nprovide clear evidence that vendors have demonstrated technical expertise in all areas identified in section 3 of the RFQ; section 3 of the RFQ stat ed that the successful \ncontractor \u201cshall perform all required program management duties,\u201d including practicing \u201c[s]caled [a]gile [f]ramework (SAFe) methodologies during contract performance.\u201d  RFQ at 12- 13.  The protester\u2019s argument that demonstration of SAFe methodologies was not \na solicitation requirement under the past performance factor is thus meritless.\n8 \n \nIMTA S collaterally argues that the FBI had information \u201ctoo close at hand\u201d to ignore \nconcerning its past performance and experience with practicing SAFe methodologies.  \nComments & Supp. Protest at 18.  In this regard, the protester argues that the first example project it submitted, which was an order issued against the same BPA as the \norder contemplated by the procurement  here, \u201cinvolved work consistent with\u201d SAFe \nmethodologies.  Id . \n Our Office has, in certain circumstances, explained that an agency \u201cmay\u201d consider past performance information that is \u201c too close  at hand\u201d to ignore in evaluating proposals.  \nVectorCSP, LLC , B-421764, B -421764.4, Sept. 27, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 229 at 9.   \nHowever, we have declined to extend the close- at-hand line of decisions beyond the \narea of past performance so as to require an agency to consider close- at-hand \ninformation in the context of an experience evaluation.  Id.   Moreover, the \u201ctoo close at \nhand\u201d line of decisions is not intended to remedy an off eror\u2019s failure to include \ninformation in its proposal.  Id.   Such circumstances are instead governed by the well -\nestablished principle that offerors are responsible for submitting a well -written proposal \n \n8 To the extent the protester argues that the solicitation unreasonably required each \nvendor to \u201c restate its entire technical volume within the text of its past performance \nvolume\u201d to show experience practicing SAFe methodologies, we find this argument is also meritless.   Protest at 25.   Under the technical approach factor, vendors were \nrequired to submit a plan and approach that included a demonstration of experience practicing SAFe methodologies.  RFQ at 32.  This requirement was in addition to at least seven other enumerated areas that the agency would review under this factor.  See id . at 32- 33.  The protester\u2019s contention that it would have to \u201c restate its entire \ntechnical volume\u201d is thus a gross mischaracterization of the solicitation\u2019s requirements.   \nComments & Supp. Protest at 17.   Furthermore, notwithstanding that the protester\u2019s \ntechnical approach discussed the use of SAFe methodologies, it did so without specific reference to an example contract  where this expertise was demonstrated.   See AR, \nTab 4.1, IMTAS Technical Volume at  8.  As explained above, the solicitation required \nexamples of demonstrated expertise in all areas of section 3 of the RFQ (including SAFe methodologies), and even in the protester\u2019s technical approach, specific examples of such expertise were not provided.    Page 15    B-423190; B -423190.2   with adequately detailed information that allows for a meaningful review by the \nprocuring agency.  Id . \n We find IMTA S\u2019s argument meritless for two primary reasons.   First,  the agency made a \nfinding of decreased confidence because IMTAS did \u201cnot show experience\u201d practicing SAFe methodologies on prior contracts.  The protester argues that it did have experience working with SAFe methodologies under the same overarching BPA and that it was unreasonable for the agency to \u201cignore this \u2018close at hand\u2019 experience.\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 18.  As noted above, the \u201cclose at hand\u201d line of decisions does not extend to information in the context of an experience evaluation.  Here, although the factor was titled  \u201cpast performance, \u201d the evaluation focused on vendors \ndemonstrating their experience with different technical skills.  Given this, we conclude that the \u201ctoo close at hand\u201d decisions  do not apply here and the agency was not \nrequired to consider this experience information.  At any rate, IMTAS explained its prior experience as involving work \u201cconsistent with\u201d SAFe methodologies .  This  is different \nthan actually practic ing SAFe methodologies , which is what the solicitation required.   \n Second, the protester submitted as a past performance example the project which it claims demonstrated work consistent with SAFe methodologies.  See  AR, Tab 4.3, \nIMTA S Past Performance Volume at 3- 4.  Despite including this example and \nattempting to mirror section 3 requirements of the RFQ, the protester \u2019s quotation failed \nto demonstrate the required experience with SAFe methodologies , and otherwise failed \nto demonstrate in its quotation how its experience on the example project was consistent with SAFe methodolo gies.  Therefore, this was not a case of the agency \nfailing to consider \u201cclose at hand\u201d information, but instead represents the failure of the \nprotester to submit a well -written quotation that allowed for meaningful review by the \nagency.  See VectorCSP, LLC,  supra.  This protest ground is denied.  \n We also find the FBI\u2019s second decreased confidence finding ass essed to IMTA S\u2019s \nquotation reasonable.  As explained above, the RFQ advised that the past performance examples submitted by vendors \u201cshould demonstrate the [vendor] has provided similar size, scope, relevancy, and capability as the [g]overnment\u2019s requirement\u201d and that t he \nexample contracts \u201cshall be similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described\u201d by the solicitation.  RFQ at 33.  The third example submitted by IMTA S involved a contract performed by its teaming partner that the record \ndemonstrates was for support of only 7,140 devices and 5,910 users --well short of the \nexpected 40,000- 50,000 devices contemplated by the current order.  AR, Tab 4.3, \nIMTAS Past Performance Volume at 7; AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  Accordingly, and consistent with the evaluation criterion\u2019s requirement that examples \u201cshall be\u201d similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the present  \nrequirement, the agency\u2019s as sessment of a decreased confidence finding was \nreasonable.  \n   \nMoreover, there is nothing in the record to support IMTA S\u2019s position that the FBI \nrequired three examples of past performance in order to merit a rating of some or high confidence.  The RFQ stated that vendors could submit \u201cup to three\u201d past performance  Page 16    B-423190; B -423190.2   examples.  The protester was therefore not required, but instead elected, to submit a \nthird past performance example that fell short of the solicitation requirements for past \nperformance.   In this regard, the agency made a finding of decreased confidence \nbecause across all three examples, IMTAS failed to demonstrate experience practicing \nSAFe methodologies.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 14.  In addition, the agency made a decreased c onfidence finding because IMTAS\u2019s third example was not similar in   \nsize, scope, and magnitude as the effort contemplated by the solicitation.  Id.   Thus, the \nrecord does not demonstrate that the FBI required three past performance examples in order to receive a rating of some or high confidence.  Rather, the record shows that the agency assessed a rating of  low confidence to IMTAS\u2019s quotation because the \nquotation did not sufficiently demonstrate the required experience in a manner that was \ncomparable to what is required for this procurement across all three of its example projects.  We find this reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria and deny \nthis protest ground.       \n  i3\u2019s Past Performance  and Disparate Treatment   \n IMTA S also challenges the FBI\u2019s evaluation of i3\u2019s past performance in various \nrespects.  In this regard, the protester argues that the record demonstrates that the FBI unreasonably considered information outside of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume in eval uating the awardee\u2019s  quotation, and that by failing to similarly consider \ninformation outside its own past performance volume, the agency engaged in disparate \ntreatment in evaluating proposals.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 3- 5.  In support of its \nargument the protester points to statements in the evaluation record under the past \nperformance factor that attribute certain past performance experience to the awardee or \nits subcontractor even though the awardee or subcontractor did not perform on that respective past performance example.  The protester also contends that the agency \u201c[i]mproperly [d]ouble- [c]ounted\u201d an increased confidence finding with respect to one of \nthe awardee\u2019s past performance example projects.\n9  Id. at 6-7. \n The FBI contends that its evaluation o f i3\u2019s past performance volume was reasonable \nand adhered to the solicitation\u2019s instructions and requirements.  Supp. COS at 2.  In this \nregard, the agency explains that it \u201cdid not and could not\u201d consider information \ncontained in other volumes of the awardee\u2019s quotation as the protester argues, because \nthe solicitation precluded such consideration explaining that the solicitation provided \n \n9 The protester initially challenged the agency\u2019s evaluation of i3\u2019s past performance on \nthe basis that the awardee could not meet the solicitations\u2019 minimum size and scope requirements for past performance references.  Protest at 27- 28.  The agency report \ndiscussed the FBI\u2019s evaluation of the awardee\u2019s past performance in detail and specifically responded to the protester\u2019s argument, taking the position that the awardee\u2019s submitted examples did meet the RFQ\u2019s requirements.  MOL at 18 -19.  The \nprotester did not meaningfully respond to this particular aspect of the agency\u2019s argument, and instead filed the supplemental protest grounds explained above.  Accordingly, we consider this aspect of the protest abandoned.  See Zin Technologies, Inc., supra.

With respect to the statements in the past \nperformance evaluation record that form the basis of the protester \u2019s argument , the \nagency explains that its contemporaneous evaluation documents contained minor \nerrors, but that the documents otherwise demonstrate that it evaluated the awardee\u2019s quotation based only on information contained in the awardee\u2019s past performance \nsubmission.  Id. at 3 -4.  With regard to the protester\u2019s position that the agency \nimproperly \u201cdouble counted\u201d increased confidence findings for one of the submitted projects , the agency maintains that the findings were assessed for different \nrequirements in the RFQ that the agency found were reflected in the awardee\u2019s \nperformance of that project .

Given these \ndisparities, t he protester asserts that the only way the agency could have assessed  Page 18    B-423190; B -423190.2   increased confidence findings in this regard is if the agency improperly located the \ninformation supporting these  findings in another part of i\u20193\u2019s quotation, such as its \ntechnical approach, or from outside the awardee\u2019s quotation entirely.   Id. at 5 -6.  The \nprotester further asserts the agency\u2019s treatment of the awardee\u2019s quotation was disparate from its own, because the agency did not seek information from outside the protester\u2019s past performance volume in evaluating the protester\u2019s quotation.   Id. at 5.  \n In response to IMTAS\u2019s argument, t he contracting officer explains that the awardee\u2019s \nexample 1 project was performed by its teaming partner 3rd E ye, and that i3 was not \ninvolved.  Supp. COS at 3.  The agency explains that the increased confidence finding in question \u201cinadvertently left out the word \u2018partner\u2019 as the finding was intended to refer to 3rd Eye\u2019s experience under [ e]xample 1. \u201d  Id.

Notwithstanding these minor errors, the \ncontracting officer explains that the basis of each of the underlying increased confidence findings can be readily traced to the awardee\u2019s quotation.  Thus, contrary to the protester\u2019s argument, the agency  contends that it  did not consider information from \noutside of i3\u2019s past performance volume and there was no unequal treatment  of \nvendors .  Id. at 3 -4.  The agency similarly ties each of its increased confidence findings \nwith respect to i3\u2019s past performance to a section of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume.  Id . at 4 -6. \n On this record, w e find no basis to question the FBI\u2019s evaluation of quotations in this \nregard and conclude that the protester has not demonstrated the agency disparately evaluated quotations.  T he agency\u2019s post -protest explanations of the typographical \nerrors in its contemporaneous documentation are reasonable and consistent with the underlying record.  For example, it is evident that for example 1, the agency intended to refer to i3\u2019s partner, 3rd Eye.  This is supported by the two other increased confidence findings that reference 3rd Eye with respect to example 1 in the contemporaneous documentation.  See AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  Further, the substance of \nthe increased confidence finding is reflected in the awardee\u2019s quotation under the 3rd Eye example, example 1.  \n   \nSimilarly, the FBI  reasonably explains that the erroneous reference to \u201cExample 3\u201d  for \none of the increased confidence findings  should have read \u201cExample 1.\u201d  This is \nsupported by the fact that the increased confidence findings were listed in numerical order by past performance example number , and again, because the substance of the \nfinding is reflected in the awardee\u2019s past performance volume under the 3rd Eye \nexample project.  See id. ; AR, Tab 5, i3 Past Performance Volume at 4- 5. \n On this record, we find that IMTA S cannot demonstrate that the FBI disparately \nevaluated quotations  by considering information from outside the awardee\u2019s quotation.   \nThe agency tied each of its increased confidence findings for the awardee to a relevant section of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume.  Thus, the record belies  the \nprotester\u2019s argument that the agency must have considered information outside of the awardee\u2019s past performance volume (that is,  by considering either information  Page 19    B-423190; B -423190.2   contained in the awardee\u2019s  technical approach, or through the evaluators\u2019 personal \nknowledge of i3\u2019s previous work ).  The agency\u2019s explanation that the evaluation record \ncontained some minor errors is supported by the record.  Any difference in the ratings \nassessed to the vendors\u2019 under t he past performance factor was thus plainly the result \nof the different content of their quotations, as documented by the agency.10 \n The record also demonstrates the FBI assessed two increased confidence findings to i3\u2019s quotation with respect to project example 2, a previous i3 contract.  AR, Tab 6, Consensus Evaluation at 9.  One of the findings was specifically for the awardee\u2019s work  \n\u201cmanaging cost data\u201d for the Department of the Interior, utilizing a \u201ccutting- edge analytic \nhub that can detect fraud[.]\u201d  Id.  The other finding, which related to the same \nDepartment of the Interior contract, was assessed because of the awardee\u2019s \u201cability to successfully manage the [] project, which has a contract value of nearly twice that [of the current requirement,]\u201d and that \u201cincrease[ d] [our] confidence in i3\u2019s ability to manage \nthe [current] program.\u201d  Id .  \n We find the FBI\u2019s assessment of the two separate increased confidence findings to i3\u2019s \npast performance example 2 was reasonable, and did not constitute a \u201cdouble counting of strength s\u201d as alleged by IMTAS.  The agency reasonably explains that the separate \nfindings were with respect to two different aspects of the solicitation\u2019s requirements.  Specifically, the agency explains that the RFQ contained a requirement for the \n \n10 In its supplemental comments, the protester raises  for the first time  various \narguments concerning the increased confidence findings assessed to the awardee\u2019s \nquotation under the past performance factor  that we find untimely .  The agency \nproduced the awardee\u2019s entire past performance volume, as well as its evaluation thereof , with its initial agency report.  The protester timely raised the arguments \ndescribed above i n its comments and supplemental protest, however, IMTAS then \nraised additional arguments for the first time in its supplemental comments concerning the content of the increased confidence findings . \nFor example, the protester argues that the awardee was assessed an increased confidence finding for its tier 3 and tier 4 personnel providing end users with troubleshooting support and response to service tickets, but that its own quotation also demonstrated these types of services yet did not receive an increased confidence finding.  Supp. Comments at 4- 5.  Our regulations do not contemplate the piecemeal \npresentation or development of protest issues through later submissions providing alternate or more specific legal arguments missing from earlier general allegations of impropriety.  CORMAC Corp , B-421532, B -421532.2, June 14, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 142 \nat 4-5 n.8.  We will dismiss a protester\u2019s piecemeal presentation of arguments that could \nhave been raised earlier in the protester process.  Here, the protester knew that the agency had assessed an increased confidence finding to the awardee\u2019s quotation for  \nexperience providing certain troubleshooting and end user support services when the \ninitial agency report was filed, however, it chose not to challenge this  aspect of the \nfinding until it filed its supplemental comments.  This amounts to piecemeal presentation of protest issues that our Office will not consider.

The awardee\u2019s demonstrated experience, specifically with \nmanaging cost data and detecting fraud, demonstrated expertise with the cost avoida nce requirement.   \n  \nThe agency explains that the other increased confidence finding encompassed the awardee\u2019s demonstrated ability to \u201cmanage and administer [an] entire program,\u201d which is different than the specific finding related to cost avoidance explained above.   Supp. \nCOS at 8.   As one specific example, the agency explains that the awardee\u2019s example \nproject demonstrated experience with SAFe methodologies that are required by the current solicitation.   Id.

        "Summary":"1.  Protest challenging conduct of discussions as not meaningful  is denied where  \nagency informed protester its labor hours were insufficient, protester chose not to adjust its labor hours, and the final evaluation reflects a more detailed rationale for the stated concern--insufficient labor hours --not an unrelated and undisclosed concern, as claimed \nby protester . \n 2.  Protest challenging assessment of a significant weakness in protester\u2019s staffing \napproach is dismissed in part as an untimely challenge to the terms of the solicitation.  \nRemaining protest allegations are denied where the evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the solicitation.    \nDECISION  \n Brandan Enterprises, Inc. (BEI), a small business of Knoxville, Tennessee, protests the issuance of a task order to Quality Innovation, Inc. (Qi2), a small business of Austin, Texas, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W15QKN -24-R- 0099, issued by the \nDepartment of the Army for visit or operations services at Arlington National Cemetery.  \nThe protester challenges the conduct of discussions, evaluation of BEI\u2019s proposal, and the resulting best -value tradeoff source selection decision.  \n We deny the protest.   \n   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2     B-423385   BACKGROUND  \n \nOn September 17, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, the agency issued the solicitation to  holders of  the Army\u2019s Human \nResource Solutions Recruiting, Management , and Administrative Services  multiple -\naward, indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts .  Agency Report (AR), \nTab 4, Ini tial RFP at 1.\n1  The solicitation sought proposals for the provision of visitor \noperations services at Arlington National Cemetery  (ANC)  in Virginia.  Id.   The required \nservices \u201cinclude visitor screening at entry points  (designated gates and Welcome \nCenter), visitor information assistance at key locations within the cemetery, and vehicle\/pedestrian traffic control at designated locations .\u201d  AR, Tab 22, RFP attach.  1, \nPerformance Work Statement (PWS) at 1.   The solicitation provided the successful \ncontractor would be required to \u201cprovide all personnel, supervision, equipment, \nmaterials, transportation, and non- personal services necess ary to perform\u201d the tasks set \nout in the PWS.  Id. \n The solicitation established that a \u201csingle Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Order (TO) with cost reimbursable (CR no indirects\/fee) line items for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) for a 12-month base period . . . and three 12- month option periods \u201d would be issued.  AR, \nTab 23, Task Order Evaluation Plan (TOEP) at 2 .  Award would be made on a \nbest-value tradeoff basis , considering a technical factor and cost\/price, with the \ntechnical factor being significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  The technical \nfactor consisted of four evaluation areas, which the solicitation specifically emphasized \nwere not subfactors and would not be separately weighted.  Id. at 5.  The four \nevaluation areas were:  (1) technical approach; (2) staffing approach; (3)  management \nprocess; and (4) transition plan.  Id.  at 5-8.   \n Under the technical factor , the agency would assess an offeror\u2019s understanding of the \nrequirements , the completeness and adequacy of the offeror\u2019s response, and the \nfeasibility of the offeror\u2019s proposed approach .  AR, Tab 23, TOEP  at 11.  The evaluators \nwould assign an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable for the technical factor , and also would assess technical risk.  Id.  at 11- 12.  \nPrice would be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.  Id.  at 14.  \n The agency received three proposals, including those submitted by the protester and \nawardee, Qi2.  AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision (SSD) at 1.   The Army \nestablished a competitive range that included all three offerors, and the agency conducted discussions with all three.  Id. at 3.  After reviewing offerors \u2019 discussion \nresponses and revised proposals, \u201cthe Government identified the need to re- open \ndiscussions.\u201d  Id.  The Army conducted a second round of discussions , after which final \nrevised proposals  were submitted by all three offerors.  Id.   The agency assessed the \nprotester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s final proposals as follows:  \n \n \n1 Our citations use the Adobe PDF pagination of documents in the record.   Page 3     B-423385    Protester --BEI Awardee --Qi2 \nTechnical Factor  Good  Outstanding  \nPrice   $32,144,684  $37,859,757  \n \nId. at 4.   \n The source selection authority ( SSA) conducted a tradeoff between BEI\u2019s proposal, \nwhich was the lowest -priced of the three offers received, and Qi2\u2019s higher technically \nrated proposal, which was the highest -priced of the three offers received.   AR, Tab 45, \nSSD at 8.  In conducting the tradeoff, the SSA acknowledged various meritorious \naspects of BEI\u2019s proposal, but also noted the proposal was assessed a significant weakness due to concerns that it did not include sufficient labor hours, resulting in a significant risk to performance.  Id. at 10-11.  The SSA found that while BEI \u201csubmitted \nthe proposal with the lowest [price], the Offeror presents a less advantageous technical approach due to the inherent risks associated with the Significant Weakness.\u201d  Id. at 11.   \nIn contrast, the SSA concluded Qi2\u2019s \u201ctechnical proposal is superior to all other offerors and provides the Government with the highest degree of confidence of successful task order performance.\u201d  Id.  The SSA detailed a number of  advantages offered by Qi2\u2019s  \nproposal  that warranted payment of its  associated price premium , while still being below \nthe independent government estimate (IGE) and \u201cwithin the Government\u2019s budget constraints.\u201d  Id. at 11-12. \n After being notified of the award decision and receiving a debriefing, BEI filed this \nprotest with our Office.\n2 \n \nDISCUSSION \n As noted above, the evaluators assessed a significant weakness in the protester\u2019s proposal because BEI did not propose sufficient labor hours to meet all the PWS requirements.  The protester challenges the agency\u2019s conduct of discussions with \nregards to the significant weakness , as well as the underlying assessment of the \nweakness .  For the reasons explained below, we deny BEI\u2019s challenges .  While we do \nnot address every argument, or permutation thereof, raised by the protester, we have considered them all,  and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.\n3 \n \n2 The value of the protested task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is \nwithin our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under defense agency IDIQ contracts.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B). \n3 For example, BEI contends the agency erred in not assessing one additional strength \nand two additional significant strengths in the firm\u2019s proposal  related to the protester\u2019s \nretention plan, transition plan, and personnel, respectivel y, the assessment of  which, \nthe protester maintains, would have resulted in BEI\u2019s proposal being assigned the \nhighest adjectival rating of outstanding--rather than a rating of good--for the technical factor .  Protest at 33- 37.  In its comments on the agency\u2019s report responding to the \n(continued...)   Page 4     B-423385   Significant Weakness  \n \nRelevant to the significant weakness at the heart of BEI\u2019s protest, are the solicitation\u2019s staffing requirements and staffing approach evaluation criteria.   With respect to staffing, \nthe solicitation require d the successful contractor to provide all necessary personnel to \nperform three categories of visitor operations services --visitor screening, visitor \ninformation assistance, and vehicle\/pedestrian traffic control.  PWS at 40.   Personnel \nwill be required to perform these services at both fixed posts and roving posts.  Id.  The \nsolicitation set out  the post positions in PWS t echnical exhibit 4, which showed there \nwere 43 posts to staff during the half of the year considered \u201csummer months\u201d  and 38 \nposts to staff during the winter months.   Id. at 40, 71; Protest at 180 (Protest exh. A, \nRFP Questions and Answers at Q.  No. 2) .\n4  In addition to specifying the posts to be \n \nprotest, BEI withdrew  it contention that the evaluators should have assessed a strength \nfor the protester\u2019s proposed retention plan.  Comments at 33 n.19.   For the two \nremaining allegations of significant  strengths  the protester argues the agency \nimproperly failed to assess , the crux of the protester\u2019s contentions  is that BEI exceeded \nthe RFP\u2019s requirements  by having the incumbent contractor as part of its  team , by virtue \nof which BEI was able to offer a \u201c seamless transition\u201d and personnel with experience \nworking on the incumbent contract .  Protest at  36, 38- 39.   \nAn agency\u2019s judgment that the features identified in a proposal do not exceed the requirements of a solicitation or provide advantages to the government warranting assessment of a strength is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion, which we will not disturb unless a protester shows the evaluation was unreasonable.  Assessment and \nTraining Solutions Consulting Corp. , B-421575.3, B -421575.4, July 16, 2024, 2024 CPD \n\u00b6 177 at 15.  Here, the protester has not made such a showing, and t he record provides \nno basis for us to question the evaluators\u2019 judgment that neither BEI\u2019s transition plan nor \nits personnel merited the assessment of additional significant strengths in the \nprotester\u2019s proposal.  For instance, the record shows the evaluators specifically noted \nBEI\u2019s \u201cproposal describes in detail their personnel with qualified experience,\u201d but \nconcluded BEI\u2019s proposal in this respect met \u201cthe requirements in the staffing approach area.\u201d  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 11.    \nAlthough BEI may consider aspects of its proposal to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis \non which to sustain the protest .  See e.g., CACI, Inc.--Federal , B-420729.2, Mar. 1, \n2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  51 at 9 (denying allegation that proposal merited additional strengths \nwhere protest submission and contemporaneous evaluation record demonstrated only \nthat protester \u201cholds a different opinion from the evaluators\u201d about the proposal).   Nor \ndoes the BEI team\u2019s incumbency status entitle it to higher ratings or provide any basis \nfor finding the evaluation unreasonable.

For ease of reference, our citation here \n(continued...)

The solicitation explained that the cemetery receives over 3 \nmillion visitors a year, conducts approximately 7,000 funerals a year, and \u201cover 3,400 other ceremonies such as commemorations, wreath ceremonies, and head- of-state \nvisits\u201d each year.  Id.  at 1.  The solicitation required  the provision of additional surge \npersonnel , beyond the number needed to staff the regular posts , on an as needed basis \nfor events  or holidays .  Id. at 42.    \n For evaluation of the staffing approach area, the solicitation required each proposal to provide \u201c[a] detailed explanation of the Offeror\u2019s staffing methodology ,\u201d to include the \n\u201cbasis for calculating annual productive hours.\u201d   AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 6 -7.  Specific to \nlabor hours, the solicitation stated:  \u201cIf the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical hours\/labor, the Offeror shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of t his variance.\u201d   Id. \nat 7.  With respect to technical exhibit 3 , while it  was \u201cnot a Government required level \nof effort,\u201d the solicitation stated that \u201cany proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, \nand in sufficient enough detail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government\u2019s requirement.\u201d  Id.   \n The record reflects the agency\u2019s evaluation was informed by the level of \u201chistorical support required\u201d to perform the requirement .  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical \nEvaluation at 13.  Additionally, the record shows to aid in its comparison of offerors\u2019 proposed staffing levels with historical staffing levels, the agency prepared an independent government estimate (IGE), which estimated a need for 10 0 full -time \nequivalents (FTEs) to perform the requirement .\n5  AR, Tab 50, IGE at 1.  \n \n \nto protest exh.

Page 6     B-423385   Adequacy of Discussions \n \nThe protester challenges the agency\u2019s conduct of discussions related to the significant weakness assessed in BEI\u2019s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  The protester \ncontends the agency failed \u201cto conduct meaningful discussions\u201d about the significant weakness.  Protest at 17.  The protester maintains the Army failed \u201cto provide sufficient information to allow BEI to understand the aspects of its staffing plan that the Agency found problematic so as to provide a reasonable opportunity to address those aspects and be competitive for award.\u201d  Id.   The agency responds that \u201c[d]iscussions were \nconducted appropriately and provided BEI with sufficient information allowing them to correct a significant weakness.\u201d  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of \nLaw ( COS\/MOL ) at 13- 14.  We agree.  \n The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement at issue here.   M.A. \nMortenson Co. , B-413714, Dec. 9, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  361 at 8.  In this regard, section \n16.505 of the FAR does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order competition; nonetheless, when an agency conducts exchanges with offerors in a task order competition, those exchanges  must be fair , meaningful,  and not misleading.   \nVerizon Bus.

Rather, agencies  need only lead offerors into the areas of their \nproposals that require amplification or revision.   Id.; Engility Corp. , B-413120.3 et al. , \nFeb. 14, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  70 at 6.   Further, the exact content of discussions largely is \na matter of the contracting officer\u2019s judgment.  Id. at 8. \n Relevant here, the record shows that during the second round of discussions, the agency issued BEI an evaluation notice (EN) that identified a significant weakness.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.  The EN stated:  \u201cThe Offeror proposes labor hours that are \ninsufficient to provide the tasks listed in the PWS.\u201d  Id.   The EN explained:  \n \nThe Offeror\u2019s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take in account planed and unplanned vacancies\/absences.  \n Insufficient staffing reflects a lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  \n  Page 7     B-423385   Id.  The EN then advised:  \u201cFailure to address this finding will likely impact the offeror\u2019s \nproposal rating when re- evaluated.\u201d  Id. \n \nIn response, BEI represented:  \u201cAfter a thorough review of our proposed staffing model, \nBEI has determined that we have provided adequate staffing to ensure each position\/  \npost is staffed 100 [percent]  of the time in accordance with the Performance Work \nStatement (PWS) requirements and that we did take into account planned and unplanned vacancies\/absences.\u201d  AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Resp onse at 2.  BEI then \nwent on to explain how it developed its proposed labor hours.  See id. generally at 2- 4.  \nThe protest er concluded its response to the EN with the following assertion:  \n \nBEI has proposed adequate hours for all proposed posts during full years (option periods).  Since BEI took a [DELETED]  approach to staffing that \nensured each post was staffed at 100 [percent] , BEI has taken into \naccount planned and unplanned vacancies\/absences. . . .  Any additional \nhours would unnecessarily increase the cost to the government.  \n Id. at 4.  In short , BEI answered the EN by explaining the basis for its proposed labor \nhours, but chose not to increase its labor hours in response to the evaluators\u2019 concern \nthey were insufficient . \n The evaluators found BEI\u2019s response unconvincing, noting:  \n \nIn reviewing the Offeror\u2019s proposal revision, the Offeror addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient \nProposed Labor Hours).  Upon review of the Offeror\u2019s final proposal submission, the previously identified significant weakness was not adequately resolved.  \n \nAR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9.  As a result, the agency assessed a significant weakness to BEI\u2019s final proposal under the staffing approach area of the \ntechnical factor .  Id.  In addition to the significant weakness, BEI\u2019s final proposal was \nassessed one significant strength and one strength, which resulted in the assignment of \nan overall rating of good for the technical evaluation factor .  Id. at 2, 9.  \n With respect to the significant weakness, the Army  found that BEI had continued to \npropose insufficient labor hours.  Specifically, the evaluators concluded:  \n \nDuring the second round of discussions, the offeror provided an EN response for this finding that identified the Offeror did not take planned and unplanned vacancies\/absences into account in their previous \nproposal submission.  The Offeror provided a detai led EN response that \nexplained how they calculated their proposed hours.  However, there is \nsignificant risk to the Government based on the fact that the Government will not know if a post is manned (due to call outs\/unplanned vacancies) under their staffi ng plan because the personnel are only responsible for  Page 8     B-423385   the hours they are on post.  The proposal does not address roll call or the \ninherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post.  The Government would only find out about these issues when it is time to staff the post or upon notification from the employee that they are calling out and then have to scramble to get someone on site from the other s hift, \nor flex someone to cover their post from another post within ANC.  \n The Offeror\u2019s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take into account the required pre and post shift tasks associated with contractor employee\u2019s daily shifts.  \n Insufficient staffing reflects lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  \n Id. at 12- 13. \n In support of its contention that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions, the protester first claims that \u201cthe Final Technical Evaluation Report concedes that BEI \u2018addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient Proposed Labor Hours)\u2019 but, nonetheless, identified a Significant Weakness in BEI\u2019s \nStaffing Approach.\u201d  Protest at 23.  Here, t he protester\u2019s claim --that the evaluators \nconsidered BEI\u2019s EN response sufficient to address the significant weakness --rings  \nespecially hollow given that the very next sentence in the final evaluation report  \nunequivocally states,  \u201cthe previously identified significant weakness  was not adequately \nresolved. \u201d  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9 (emphasis added).   \n \nThe protester further compounds its selective reading of the agency\u2019s evaluation by asserting next that the Army  \u201ccontinues to couch its finally assigned Significant \nWeakness as a problem with BEI\u2019s proposed labor hours, [but] the Agency\u2019s actual \nconcern appears to be\u201d something else that was not conveyed to BEI during discussions.  Protest at 23.  Specifically, the protester contends \u201cthe Agency\u2019s actual concern appears to be that BEI\u2019s \u2018proposal does not address roll call or t he inherent \ntasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post,\u2019 which could lead to late breaking changes in the specific personnel that may be available to perform on any given day and BEI \u2018scrambl[ing]\u2019 to adjust.\u201d  Id. (citing AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical \nEvaluation at 12.  In this connection, t he protester contends :   \n \nThat concern is not tied to the number of labor hours BEI, or any other offeror, proposes to perform \u201cthe tasks listed in the PWS,\u201d however, as personnel may call out of work on short notice and otherwise must get to work to perform \u201cthe tasks listed in the PWS\u201d regardless of how many  Page 9     B-423385   labor hours an offeror proposed to provide.  Indeed, \u201cthe tasks listed in the \nPWS\u201d do not include, for example, personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work such that it is patently unreasonable to expect any proposal to address \u201cthe inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u201d let alone to imagine that offerors would \naccount for such time in pricing their proposals.  \n Protest at 23.  The protester characterizes the agency\u2019s EN as \u201cvague,\u201d maintaining that it \u201cdid not provide sufficient information for BEI to understand that it needed to address \u2018roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/t ransported to \npost\u2019 to be competitive for award.\u201d  Id.    \n As an initial matter, we note the protester\u2019s interpretation of the evaluation\u2019s reference to \u201cinherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u201d as  equating \nto \u201cpersonnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work\u201d is a fallacy premised on a false equivalency drawn from the language of the evaluation report.  When read in \ncontext with the preceding sentence\u2019s stated concern that \u201cpersonnel are only responsible for the hours they are on post,\u201d it is clear the evaluators\u2019 reference to there being insufficient hours to account for \u201cinherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u201d relates to various pre- shift and post -shift tasks an employee will \nneed to attend to at the cemetery outside of the normal  operating hours of 8:00 a.m. to \n5:00 p.m.  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 13; PWS at 6 (specifying the \ncemetery\u2019s normal operating hours) ; see also id. at  41-48 (PWS sections 5.1.1.1, \n5.1.1.2, 5.1.3.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.10, 5.2.10.6, 5.2.12, 5.2.13, 5.2.14, 5.3.1.1, 5.4.1.2, 5.3.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.5.1, 5.5 specifying that various posts are required to be staffed during \nthe entirety of the cemetery\u2019s normal operating hours).   \n \nThe agency explains that \u201c[t]he PWS includes descriptions of the pre and post operational hour tasks in multiple areas,\u201d and that ensuring suffici ent labor hours to \naccount for these tasks was \u201cnot reflected in BEI\u2019s response to the EN\u201d because \u201cthe proposed hours were based on an 8am start time.\u201d  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 5 -6.  For example, section 5.7 of the PWS requires contractor personnel \nto perform daily checks of both government -furnished and contractor -furnished \nscreening equi pment to ensure the equipment is fully operational , and the PWS task  \nestimates some of these checks may take approximately 20 minutes .  PWS at 49 -50; \nsee also AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 5 (proposing to \u201cPerform\/ensure \n[DELETED]. \u201d) and at 6 (similarly proposing to  perform [DELETED] related tasks ).  The \nagency acknowledges that BEI\u2019s response to the EN showed \u201chours proposed for \nVisitor Screeners were based on 9 hours daily (8am - 5pm hours of operation IAW [in \naccordance with] PWS 5.1.1.1 and 5.1.1.2) ,\u201d with additional hours  proposed \u201cfor \n\u2018[DELETED] ,\u2019\u201d but the evaluators found that BEI  still made \u201cno mention of pre- shift \npreparation  or roll up of personnel to assume post positions by the 8am ANC opening \ntime as a factor in BEI\u2019s calculation of hours .\u201d  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair \nDecl. at 6.  \n  Page 10     B-423385   As another example, some of the post locations necessitate contractor personnel \nopening and closing access doors or other access points prior to the start of and after \nthe end of a shift, respectively.  See e.g., PWS at 44-46 (\u00a7\u00a7 5.2.10, 5.2.12).  A further \nexample, is the PWS\u2019 s description of \u201ca significant amount of equipment, to include \nweather -conditional items which may need to be set -up, taken down, and stored daily \nsuch as umbrellas, tents, heaters, fuel, fans , folding chairs, and outdoor screening \nequipment ,\u201d for which the pre -shift and post -shift set -up and take- down time \u201ccan be \nsignificant , especially considering the time it takes to transport personnel and \nequipment\/supplies to the geographically dispersed post positions\u201d throughout the cemetery.   AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 6 (citing PWS at  37-38).  \nWhile not an exhaustive recitation of the PWS sections that set forth various \u201cinherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post,\u201d these examples serve to highlight the disingenu ous nature of the protester\u2019s contention that it could not have \nunderstood from the discussions EN that the agency wanted BEI \u2019s proposal  to include \nlabor hours for \u201cpersonnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work.\u201d  Protest at 23.    Turning to BEI\u2019s contention that the EN was vague and failed to provide sufficient information about the specific areas for which the firm needed to provide additional labor hours, we find the protester\u2019s contention unavailing.  The protester maintains that if \u201cthe Agency shared its actual areas of concern, BEI could and would have discussed \u2018roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u2019 through additional explanation in its proposal and\/or by increasing prop osed labor \nhours to alleviate the Agency\u2019s concerns.\u201d  Protest at 24.    \n \nContrary to the protester\u2019s argument, the record reflect s the EN provided to BEI made \nclear that the evaluators did not believe the protester\u2019s proposal included sufficient labor hours to perform all the PWS tasks.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at  1.  The record also \nshows the final evaluation report further elucidates the agency\u2019s concerns  by including  \nexamples of why the evaluators did not consider BEI\u2019s proposed hours sufficient  (e.g., \ncoverage of incidental tasks) .  Compare AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1 with Tab AR, \nTab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 12- 13.  While the agency could have \ndiscussed these more granular level examples with BEI, there was no requirement that the Army engage in such \u201cspoon -feeding, \u201d and we will not substitute our view for \nmatters within the contracting officer\u2019s judgment.   See e.g., Engility Corp., supra at 9 \n(denying discussions challenge where agency could have discussed additional areas of \nconcern with protester\u2019s proposal, but was not required to do so).  \n Our review of the record finds that t he agency \u2019s discussions properly led BEI to the area \nof concern with its proposal --i.e., insufficient labor hours to perform all PWS tasks.  \nFurther, the agency specifically cautioned, during discussions,  that \u201c[f]ailure to address \nthis finding will likely impact the offeror\u2019s proposal rating when re -evaluated.\u201d   AR, \nTab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.   In response to the EN, BEI made a business judgment to not \nincrease the number of labor hours proposed , but to instead explain why it disagreed \nwith the evaluators\u2019 assessment that the proposed hours were insufficient.  See generally AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.  Ultimately, it was t he protester\u2019s  Page 11     B-423385   business judgment to leave unchanged BEI \u2019s proposed level of staffing that resulted in \nthe negative evaluation, not discussions.  Accordingly, we deny BEI\u2019s challenge to the \nagency\u2019s conduct of discussions.  See e.g., Abacus  Tech. Corp.; SMS Data Prods. \nGroup, Inc., supra at 9 (denying discussions challenge where agency led protester to general area of concern--staffing level for base period--and was under no obligation to \nprovide any additional guidance or proposal direction).  \n \nAssessment of Significant Weakness  \n In addition to protesting about the agency \u2019s conduct of discussions , the protester \ndirectly challenges , as unreasonable,  the assessment of the significant weakness in \nBEI\u2019s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  T he protester contends the \nassessed weakness is \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cflawed .\u201d  Protest at 24.  Specifically, the \nprotester maintains  the evaluators unreasonably assessed the weakness because:   \n(1) \u201chistorical staffing levels do not provide a valid comparison because the incumbent \ncontract required more labor hours than the instant effort\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Agency imposed unstated evaluation criteria i n concluding that additional labor hours are required for \ncertain pre-  and post -duty tasks which are not identified in the PWS\u201d; (3) \u201cthe Agency \nignored critical information in BEI\u2019s proposal that directly addresses the Agency\u2019s concerns\u201d; and (4) \u201cBEI proposed significantly more hours than required based on the \npositions and tasks identified in the PWS .\u201d\n6  Id. at 24- 25.  The agency responds that \nBEI\u2019s protest \u201cmerely argues with the evaluation results,\u201d and that such \u201cmere disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation does not demonstrate that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.\u201d  COS\/MOL at 25.  We agree.  \n \nAs stated above, the task order competition here was conducted pursuant to FAR \nsubpart 16.5. The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a \nmatter within the contracting agency \u2019s discretion, because the agency is responsible for \ndefining its needs and the best method of accommodating them. Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc. , supra at 7.  In reviewing protests of an award in a task order competition, \nwe do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation \u2019s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.   \nCACI , Inc.-- Federal, supra at 7.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment \nof the relative merit of competing proposals, without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Id. ; Engility Corp., supra at 4-5.  \n   Use of Historical Staffing Levels in Evaluation of Proposals  \n Relevant here, t he IGE estimated a need for 10 0 FTEs to staff the contract.  AR, \nTab 50, IGE at  1.  The record shows BEI\u2019s proposal offered [DELETED]  FTEs , and was \nassessed a significant weakness  for proposing insufficient labor hours .  AR, Tab 32, BEI \n \n6 The protester raises additional ancillary arguments  challenging the assessed \nsignificant weakness as unreasonable.  While not addressed in our discussion, we have \nconsidered each of these ancillary arguments and find them all to be without merit.   Page 12     B-423385   Final Technical Proposal at 13; Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9, 12- 13.  In \nchallenging the reasonableness of this  significant weakness , the protester  takes aim at \nthe IGE, arguing it is \u201cvastly overinflated, likely because it appears the Agency based its \nestimates on the expanded but now outdated requirements from the incumbent \ncontract.\u201d  Comments at 13.    \n The protester argues  the agency\u2019s use of historical staffing levels as part of the \nevaluation was unreasonable because those \u201clevels do not provide a valid comparison\u201d to \u201cthe instant effort .\u201d  Protest at 24- 25.  The protester points out that the incumbent \ncontractor is part of BEI\u2019s team, and the firm represents that this provides \u201cTeam BEI\u201d with \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d and \u201can intimate understanding of the staffing levels and skill \nsets required.\u201d  Id. at 26 -27.  Similarly, the protester claims , \u201cthe BEI te am has unique \ninsight  into the labor hours required for successful performance,\u201d and that it \u201creasonably \ndrew\u201d on this \u201cfirsthand knowledge of staffing levels as the incumbent to develop its efficient and realistic proposed level of effort.\u201d  Id.  at 27.   Further, the protester \nmaintains \u201cthe solicitation for the incumbent contract required lengthier hours at each post and a different labor mix as the basis for estimate for the required hours, so the total number of hours on the incumbent contract is mark edly greater than required to \nperform the scope of work under the current Solicitation.\u201d  Id.   \n   \nOur Bid Protest Re gulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a \nsolicitation that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1).   Our timeliness rules reflect the dual \nrequirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.   \nVerizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 260 at 4.  To this \nend, a protester may not wait until after award has been made to protest alleged flaws in the procurement\u2019s ground rules that are apparent prior to submission of proposals.  Microsoft Corp., B -420004, B -420004.2, Oct. 29, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 155 at 30.  \n Here, as discussed above, the solicitation included as t echnical exhibit 3  visitor trends , \nworkload estimates , and stated that while this exhibit did not establish a required level \nof effort  \u201cany proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, and in sufficient enough \ndetail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government\u2019s requirements.\u201d  AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 7.   More directly, the solicitation\u2019s evaluation methodology  provided:  \n\u201cIf the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical  hours\/labor, the \nOfferor shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of this variance.\u201d  Id.   Thus, the solicitation squarely placed \nofferors  on notice that the agency intended to use \u201chistorical hours\/labor\u201d as a \nbenchmark for assessing proposals.    \n If, as expressed in its protest, BEI did not believe that historical staffing levels represented an accurate comparison point for the solicited requirement , the firm was \nrequired to raise that concern prior to the time set for receipt of proposals.   Having \nwaited to protest this issue until after the time set for receipt of proposals and after \naward, BEI\u2019s argument arising from this alleged solicitation impropriety is dismissed as  Page 13     B-423385   untimely .7  See e.g., Microsoft Corp., supra at 30; Facility Healthcare Servs., Inc. , \nB-418743.2, B -418743.3, Sept. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 313 at 7 n.4 (dismissing as \nuntimely post -award argument that comparing proposed prices to IGE was not an \nadequate evaluation method where solicitation informed offerors such an evaluation \ncould take place).  \n   Unstated Evaluation Criteria \n In addition to challenging the accuracy of the IGE used by the agency as a comparative evaluative benchmark, the protester contends the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by downgrading BEI\u2019s proposal for not addressing \u201crequired pre and post shift \ntasks\u201d  that are \u201cnot actually specified in the Solicitation.\u201d   Protest at 27 -28.  Contrary to \nthe protester\u2019s contention, however, and as detailed above, the PWS  included a variety \nof pre- shift and post -shift tasks--e.g., daily equipment checks, opening and closing \naccess to certain parts of the cemetery, etc.   Accordingly, we find no merit in BEI\u2019s claim \nthat the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by expecting offerors to propose sufficient staff to perform all the tasks set forth in the PWS.  See e.g., CAE USA, Inc. , \nB-421550 et al. , June 22, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 149 at 7 (denying protest allegation that  \nassessment of protester\u2019s staffing used unstated evaluation criteria where the language of the solicitation belied protester\u2019s argument).  \n   Proposal Information and Sufficiency of Proposed Labor Hours  \n The protester further argues that BEI\u2019s proposal did, in fact, address the agency\u2019s \nconcerns related to pre- shift and post -shift tasks by offering \u201cmore hours than required \nby the normal duty hours\u201d to be \u201cmore than sufficient to cover\u201d these various activ ities.  \nProtest at 30.  Speci fically, the protester claims , \u201cBEI proposed significantly more hours \nthan required,\u201d and characterizes the assessed weakness as \u201cunjustified and, frankly, baffling.\u201d  Id.  at 24-25.  In support of this contention, the protester  explains how it \ncalculated the number of labor hours needed, and insists  its methodology resulted in \nBEI proposing hours that were \u201croughly  [DELETED] higher than the Government\u2019s \nstated requirement.\u201d  Id. at 26.  The explanation provided in BEI\u2019s protest, however, is \nsimply a summation of the explanation included in BEI\u2019s proposal and responses to \ndiscussion ENs .  Compare id. with AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13- 14; \nsee also generally  Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.   \n In this  connection, BEI \u2019s explanation describes how the firm  calculated the number of \nhours required for each post to be continuously staffed  during the cemetery\u2019s operating \nhours  of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m .  For example, for the visitor screener posts, BEI made \n \n7 Although we need not address the merits of this argument, we note the agency \npresented a detailed rebuttal of the protester\u2019s claim that the IGE is inaccurate.  The Army explained that while the incumbent task order, as initially awarded, did require longer hours at various posts, the order was later modified to reduce the \u201chours of operation to those reflected in the current PWS.\u201d  Supp. COS\/MOL at 2; see also generally AR, Tab 56, Supp. Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 1- 2.  Page 14     B-423385   one calculation for the 183 days of the summer months when there are 18 screener \nposts to staff and a second calculation for the 182 days of the winter months when there \nare 14  posts to staff.  AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13.  BEI  added \n[DELETED] FTE [DELETED],  resulting in [DELETED] positions  to staff in the summer \nand [DELETED]  in the winter.  Id.  For each season\u2019s calculations, BEI multiplied \n9 hours per day by 183 or 182 days , multiplied that by the number of posts for the \nsummer and winter months, then added the two figures to reach a total number of [DELETED]  hours --or [DELETED] FTEs --needed to staff each of the visitor screener \nposts for exactly 9 hours per day.\n8  Id. at 13-14.  BEI \u2019s proposal also included additional \nhours for [DELETED] , but those hours were specified for those purposes and were not \nrepresented as being available for the performance of pre- shift or post -shift tasks or \ncovering for employee breaks.  Id. at 14.  \n As noted in our assessment of the protester\u2019s discussions challenge, the record shows \nthe evaluators considered the basis for BEI\u2019s labor hour estimate that was included in \nthe firm\u2019s proposal and discussions response, and, notwithstanding these explanations , \nfound the proposed hours insufficient.  Based on the record before us, we find \nimminently reasonable the evaluators\u2019 judgment  that BEI\u2019s approach of providing \nenough FTEs to staff posts for exactly 9 hours per day , without provision for pre-shift \nand post -shift duties outlined in the PWS, and with minimal staffing to cover breaks  \nfailed to provide the amount of support needed to perform the contract , warranting \nassessment of a significant weakness.  While BEI has expressed its disagreement with the evaluators\u2019 judgment in myriad arguments throughout its protest, BEI has not shown \nthat the evaluation was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.\n9  Accordingly, \n \n8 Summer ( 9 hours per day * 183  days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) + \nWinter (9 hours per day * 182 days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) = Total \nAnnual Hours of [DELETED]  divided by [DELETED]  annual hours per FTE = \n[DELETED]  FTEs .  AR, tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at  13-14. \n9 Among the protester\u2019s myriad arguments, is BEI\u2019s assertion that the assessed \nsignificant weakness is unreasonable because it \u201cresulted from a cursory, mechanical \ncomparison of bottom -line numbers between BEI\u2019s proposed labor hours and the IGE.\u201d  \nComments at 23.  The protester claims \u201cthe Agency\u2019s cursory review showed that BEI\u2019s bottom -line numbers were below the IGE, and so, the Agency contrived generic reasons \nas to why that is problematic.\u201d  Id.  at 24.  The record does not support such a finding.  \nRather, as detailed above, the record shows the evaluators fully considered the information in BEI\u2019s proposal and discussions response, and detailed in the contemporaneous evaluation record why that inf ormation was not sufficient to alleviate \nconcerns about the insufficiency of BEI\u2019s proposed labor hours.   \nTo the extent, the protester\u2019s c ontention that the evaluators \u201ccontrived generic reasons\u201d \nfor assessing a significant weakness in BEI\u2019s proposal can be construed as an allegation of bad faith, we find such an allegation meritless.

Protest challenging conduct of discussions as not meaningful  is denied where  \nagency informed protester its labor hours were insufficient, protester chose not to adjust its labor hours, and the final evaluation reflects a more detailed rationale for the stated concern--insufficient labor hours --not an unrelated and undisclosed concern, as claimed \nby protester . \n 2.  Protest challenging assessment of a significant weakness in protester\u2019s staffing \napproach is dismissed in part as an untimely challenge to the terms of the solicitation.  \nRemaining protest allegations are denied where the evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the solicitation.    \nDECISION  \n Brandan Enterprises, Inc. (BEI), a small business of Knoxville, Tennessee, protests the issuance of a task order to Quality Innovation, Inc. (Qi2), a small business of Austin, Texas, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W15QKN -24-R- 0099, issued by the \nDepartment of the Army for visit or operations services at Arlington National Cemetery.  \nThe protester challenges the conduct of discussions, evaluation of BEI\u2019s proposal, and the resulting best -value tradeoff source selection decision.  \n We deny the protest.   \n   DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has been approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2     B-423385   BACKGROUND  \n \nOn September 17, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, the agency issued the solicitation to  holders of  the Army\u2019s Human \nResource Solutions Recruiting, Management , and Administrative Services  multiple -\naward, indefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts .  Agency Report (AR), \nTab 4, Ini tial RFP at 1.\n1  The solicitation sought proposals for the provision of visitor \noperations services at Arlington National Cemetery  (ANC)  in Virginia.  Id.   The required \nservices \u201cinclude visitor screening at entry points  (designated gates and Welcome \nCenter), visitor information assistance at key locations within the cemetery, and vehicle\/pedestrian traffic control at designated locations .\u201d  AR, Tab 22, RFP attach.  1, \nPerformance Work Statement (PWS) at 1.   The solicitation provided the successful \ncontractor would be required to \u201cprovide all personnel, supervision, equipment, \nmaterials, transportation, and non- personal services necess ary to perform\u201d the tasks set \nout in the PWS.  Id. \n The solicitation established that a \u201csingle Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Order (TO) with cost reimbursable (CR no indirects\/fee) line items for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) for a 12-month base period . . . and three 12- month option periods \u201d would be issued.  AR, \nTab 23, Task Order Evaluation Plan (TOEP) at 2 .  Award would be made on a \nbest-value tradeoff basis , considering a technical factor and cost\/price, with the \ntechnical factor being significantly more important than cost\/price.  Id.  The technical \nfactor consisted of four evaluation areas, which the solicitation specifically emphasized \nwere not subfactors and would not be separately weighted.  Id. at 5.  The four \nevaluation areas were:  (1) technical approach; (2) staffing approach; (3)  management \nprocess; and (4) transition plan.  Id.  at 5-8.   \n Under the technical factor , the agency would assess an offeror\u2019s understanding of the \nrequirements , the completeness and adequacy of the offeror\u2019s response, and the \nfeasibility of the offeror\u2019s proposed approach .  AR, Tab 23, TOEP  at 11.  The evaluators \nwould assign an adjectival rating of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, or unacceptable for the technical factor , and also would assess technical risk.  Id.  at 11- 12.  \nPrice would be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.  Id.  at 14.  \n The agency received three proposals, including those submitted by the protester and \nawardee, Qi2.  AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision (SSD) at 1.   The Army \nestablished a competitive range that included all three offerors, and the agency conducted discussions with all three.  Id. at 3.  After reviewing offerors \u2019 discussion \nresponses and revised proposals, \u201cthe Government identified the need to re- open \ndiscussions.\u201d  Id.  The Army conducted a second round of discussions , after which final \nrevised proposals  were submitted by all three offerors.  Id.   The agency assessed the \nprotester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s final proposals as follows:  \n \n \n1 Our citations use the Adobe PDF pagination of documents in the record.   Page 3     B-423385    Protester --BEI Awardee --Qi2 \nTechnical Factor  Good  Outstanding  \nPrice   $32,144,684  $37,859,757  \n \nId. at 4.   \n The source selection authority ( SSA) conducted a tradeoff between BEI\u2019s proposal, \nwhich was the lowest -priced of the three offers received, and Qi2\u2019s higher technically \nrated proposal, which was the highest -priced of the three offers received.   AR, Tab 45, \nSSD at 8.  In conducting the tradeoff, the SSA acknowledged various meritorious \naspects of BEI\u2019s proposal, but also noted the proposal was assessed a significant weakness due to concerns that it did not include sufficient labor hours, resulting in a significant risk to performance.  Id. at 10-11.  The SSA found that while BEI \u201csubmitted \nthe proposal with the lowest [price], the Offeror presents a less advantageous technical approach due to the inherent risks associated with the Significant Weakness.\u201d  Id. at 11.   \nIn contrast, the SSA concluded Qi2\u2019s \u201ctechnical proposal is superior to all other offerors and provides the Government with the highest degree of confidence of successful task order performance.\u201d  Id.  The SSA detailed a number of  advantages offered by Qi2\u2019s  \nproposal  that warranted payment of its  associated price premium , while still being below \nthe independent government estimate (IGE) and \u201cwithin the Government\u2019s budget constraints.\u201d  Id. at 11-12. \n After being notified of the award decision and receiving a debriefing, BEI filed this \nprotest with our Office.\n2 \n \nDISCUSSION \n As noted above, the evaluators assessed a significant weakness in the protester\u2019s proposal because BEI did not propose sufficient labor hours to meet all the PWS requirements.  The protester challenges the agency\u2019s conduct of discussions with \nregards to the significant weakness , as well as the underlying assessment of the \nweakness .  For the reasons explained below, we deny BEI\u2019s challenges .  While we do \nnot address every argument, or permutation thereof, raised by the protester, we have considered them all,  and find that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.\n3 \n \n2 The value of the protested task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is \nwithin our jurisdiction to hear protests of task orders placed under defense agency IDIQ contracts.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B). \n3 For example, BEI contends the agency erred in not assessing one additional strength \nand two additional significant strengths in the firm\u2019s proposal  related to the protester\u2019s \nretention plan, transition plan, and personnel, respectivel y, the assessment of  which, \nthe protester maintains, would have resulted in BEI\u2019s proposal being assigned the \nhighest adjectival rating of outstanding--rather than a rating of good--for the technical factor .  Protest at 33- 37.  In its comments on the agency\u2019s report responding to the \n(continued...)   Page 4     B-423385   Significant Weakness  \n \nRelevant to the significant weakness at the heart of BEI\u2019s protest, are the solicitation\u2019s staffing requirements and staffing approach evaluation criteria.   With respect to staffing, \nthe solicitation require d the successful contractor to provide all necessary personnel to \nperform three categories of visitor operations services --visitor screening, visitor \ninformation assistance, and vehicle\/pedestrian traffic control.  PWS at 40.   Personnel \nwill be required to perform these services at both fixed posts and roving posts.  Id.  The \nsolicitation set out  the post positions in PWS t echnical exhibit 4, which showed there \nwere 43 posts to staff during the half of the year considered \u201csummer months\u201d  and 38 \nposts to staff during the winter months.   Id. at 40, 71; Protest at 180 (Protest exh. A, \nRFP Questions and Answers at Q.  No. 2) .\n4  In addition to specifying the posts to be \n \nprotest, BEI withdrew  it contention that the evaluators should have assessed a strength \nfor the protester\u2019s proposed retention plan.  Comments at 33 n.19.   For the two \nremaining allegations of significant  strengths  the protester argues the agency \nimproperly failed to assess , the crux of the protester\u2019s contentions  is that BEI exceeded \nthe RFP\u2019s requirements  by having the incumbent contractor as part of its  team , by virtue \nof which BEI was able to offer a \u201c seamless transition\u201d and personnel with experience \nworking on the incumbent contract .  Protest at  36, 38- 39.   \nAn agency\u2019s judgment that the features identified in a proposal do not exceed the requirements of a solicitation or provide advantages to the government warranting assessment of a strength is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion, which we will not disturb unless a protester shows the evaluation was unreasonable.

Here, the protester has not made such a showing, and t he record provides \nno basis for us to question the evaluators\u2019 judgment that neither BEI\u2019s transition plan nor \nits personnel merited the assessment of additional significant strengths in the \nprotester\u2019s proposal.  For instance, the record shows the evaluators specifically noted \nBEI\u2019s \u201cproposal describes in detail their personnel with qualified experience,\u201d but \nconcluded BEI\u2019s proposal in this respect met \u201cthe requirements in the staffing approach area.\u201d  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 11.    \nAlthough BEI may consider aspects of its proposal to be of greater value or benefit than what the agency assessed, such disagreement, without more, does not provide a basis \non which to sustain the protest .  See e.g., CACI, Inc.--Federal , B-420729.2, Mar. 1, \n2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  51 at 9 (denying allegation that proposal merited additional strengths \nwhere protest submission and contemporaneous evaluation record demonstrated only \nthat protester \u201cholds a different opinion from the evaluators\u201d about the proposal).   Nor \ndoes the BEI team\u2019s incumbency status entitle it to higher ratings or provide any basis \nfor finding the evaluation unreasonable.

For ease of reference, our citation here \n(continued...)

Further, the solicitation indicated posts  that \u201cshall not be self -breaking,\u201d meaning \n\u201ccontractor personnel performing screening services in these positions shall remain at their designated area of responsibility at all times until relieved by another qualified contractor \u201d personnel.  Id. at 40- 41; see also at 44.    \n The solicitation established the normal operating hours for Arlington National Cemetery \nas 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day, and that funerals are conducted Monday  through \nSaturday .  PWS at 6-7.  The solicitation explained that the cemetery receives over 3 \nmillion visitors a year, conducts approximately 7,000 funerals a year, and \u201cover 3,400 other ceremonies such as commemorations, wreath ceremonies, and head- of-state \nvisits\u201d each year.  Id.  at 1.  The solicitation required  the provision of additional surge \npersonnel , beyond the number needed to staff the regular posts , on an as needed basis \nfor events  or holidays .  Id. at 42.    \n For evaluation of the staffing approach area, the solicitation required each proposal to provide \u201c[a] detailed explanation of the Offeror\u2019s staffing methodology ,\u201d to include the \n\u201cbasis for calculating annual productive hours.\u201d   AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 6 -7.  Specific to \nlabor hours, the solicitation stated:  \u201cIf the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical hours\/labor, the Offeror shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of t his variance.\u201d   Id. \nat 7.  With respect to technical exhibit 3 , while it  was \u201cnot a Government required level \nof effort,\u201d the solicitation stated that \u201cany proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, \nand in sufficient enough detail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government\u2019s requirement.\u201d  Id.   \n The record reflects the agency\u2019s evaluation was informed by the level of \u201chistorical support required\u201d to perform the requirement .  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical \nEvaluation at 13.  Additionally, the record shows to aid in its comparison of offerors\u2019 proposed staffing levels with historical staffing levels, the agency prepared an independent government estimate (IGE), which estimated a need for 10 0 full -time \nequivalents (FTEs) to perform the requirement .\n5  AR, Tab 50, IGE at 1.  \n \n \nto protest exh.

AR, Tab 50, IGE at 1.   Page 6     B-423385   Adequacy of Discussions \n \nThe protester challenges the agency\u2019s conduct of discussions related to the significant weakness assessed in BEI\u2019s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  The protester \ncontends the agency failed \u201cto conduct meaningful discussions\u201d about the significant weakness.  Protest at 17.  The protester maintains the Army failed \u201cto provide sufficient information to allow BEI to understand the aspects of its staffing plan that the Agency found problematic so as to provide a reasonable opportunity to address those aspects and be competitive for award.\u201d  Id.   The agency responds that \u201c[d]iscussions were \nconducted appropriately and provided BEI with sufficient information allowing them to correct a significant weakness.\u201d  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of \nLaw ( COS\/MOL ) at 13- 14.  We agree.  \n The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement at issue here.   M.A. \nMortenson Co. , B-413714, Dec. 9, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  361 at 8.  In this regard, section \n16.505 of the FAR does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order competition; nonetheless, when an agency conducts exchanges with offerors in a task order competition, those exchanges  must be fair , meaningful,  and not misleading.   \nVerizon Bus.

In the context of both FAR part 15 and 16 procurements, our decisions have \nexplained that for discussions to be meaningful  an agency need not \u201cspoon- feed\u201d an \nofferor as to each and every item that could be revised to improve an offeror\u2019s proposal.  Abacus Tech.  Corp.; SMS Data Prods. Group, Inc. , B-413421 et al. , Oct. 28, 2016, \n2016 CPD \u00b6  317 at 7 .  Rather, agencies  need only lead offerors into the areas of their \nproposals that require amplification or revision.   Id.; Engility Corp. , B-413120.3 et al. , \nFeb. 14, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  70 at 6.   Further, the exact content of discussions largely is \na matter of the contracting officer\u2019s judgment.  Id. at 8. \n Relevant here, the record shows that during the second round of discussions, the agency issued BEI an evaluation notice (EN) that identified a significant weakness.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.  The EN stated:  \u201cThe Offeror proposes labor hours that are \ninsufficient to provide the tasks listed in the PWS.\u201d  Id.   The EN explained:  \n \nThe Offeror\u2019s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take in account planed and unplanned vacancies\/absences.  \n Insufficient staffing reflects a lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  \n  Page 7     B-423385   Id.  The EN then advised:  \u201cFailure to address this finding will likely impact the offeror\u2019s \nproposal rating when re- evaluated.\u201d  Id. \n \nIn response, BEI represented:  \u201cAfter a thorough review of our proposed staffing model, \nBEI has determined that we have provided adequate staffing to ensure each position\/  \npost is staffed 100 [percent]  of the time in accordance with the Performance Work \nStatement (PWS) requirements and that we did take into account planned and unplanned vacancies\/absences.\u201d  AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Resp onse at 2.  BEI then \nwent on to explain how it developed its proposed labor hours.  See id. generally at 2- 4.  \nThe protest er concluded its response to the EN with the following assertion:  \n \nBEI has proposed adequate hours for all proposed posts during full years (option periods).  Since BEI took a [DELETED]  approach to staffing that \nensured each post was staffed at 100 [percent] , BEI has taken into \naccount planned and unplanned vacancies\/absences. . . .  Any additional \nhours would unnecessarily increase the cost to the government.  \n Id. at 4.  In short , BEI answered the EN by explaining the basis for its proposed labor \nhours, but chose not to increase its labor hours in response to the evaluators\u2019 concern \nthey were insufficient . \n The evaluators found BEI\u2019s response unconvincing, noting:  \n \nIn reviewing the Offeror\u2019s proposal revision, the Offeror addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient \nProposed Labor Hours).  Upon review of the Offeror\u2019s final proposal submission, the previously identified significant weakness was not adequately resolved.  \n \nAR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9.  As a result, the agency assessed a significant weakness to BEI\u2019s final proposal under the staffing approach area of the \ntechnical factor .  Id.  In addition to the significant weakness, BEI\u2019s final proposal was \nassessed one significant strength and one strength, which resulted in the assignment of \nan overall rating of good for the technical evaluation factor .  Id. at 2, 9.  \n With respect to the significant weakness, the Army  found that BEI had continued to \npropose insufficient labor hours.  Specifically, the evaluators concluded:  \n \nDuring the second round of discussions, the offeror provided an EN response for this finding that identified the Offeror did not take planned and unplanned vacancies\/absences into account in their previous \nproposal submission.  The Offeror provided a detai led EN response that \nexplained how they calculated their proposed hours.  However, there is \nsignificant risk to the Government based on the fact that the Government will not know if a post is manned (due to call outs\/unplanned vacancies) under their staffi ng plan because the personnel are only responsible for  Page 8     B-423385   the hours they are on post.  The proposal does not address roll call or the \ninherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post.  The Government would only find out about these issues when it is time to staff the post or upon notification from the employee that they are calling out and then have to scramble to get someone on site from the other s hift, \nor flex someone to cover their post from another post within ANC.  \n The Offeror\u2019s proposed hours for this effort increase the risk to the Government because the proposed hours are significantly low when considering PWS tasks, daily positions listed in Technical Exhibit 4, and historical support required to support this requirement.  It does not take into account the required pre and post shift tasks associated with contractor employee\u2019s daily shifts.  \n Insufficient staffing reflects lack of understanding of the requirement.  This insufficient staffing level and staffing approach is a flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful task order performance.  \n Id. at 12- 13. \n In support of its contention that the agency failed to conduct meaningful discussions, the protester first claims that \u201cthe Final Technical Evaluation Report concedes that BEI \u2018addressed the following initial evaluation finding:  Significant Weakness (Insufficient Proposed Labor Hours)\u2019 but, nonetheless, identified a Significant Weakness in BEI\u2019s \nStaffing Approach.\u201d  Protest at 23.  Here, t he protester\u2019s claim --that the evaluators \nconsidered BEI\u2019s EN response sufficient to address the significant weakness --rings  \nespecially hollow given that the very next sentence in the final evaluation report  \nunequivocally states,  \u201cthe previously identified significant weakness  was not adequately \nresolved. \u201d  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9 (emphasis added).   \n \nThe protester further compounds its selective reading of the agency\u2019s evaluation by asserting next that the Army  \u201ccontinues to couch its finally assigned Significant \nWeakness as a problem with BEI\u2019s proposed labor hours, [but] the Agency\u2019s actual \nconcern appears to be\u201d something else that was not conveyed to BEI during discussions.  Protest at 23.  Specifically, the protester contends \u201cthe Agency\u2019s actual concern appears to be that BEI\u2019s \u2018proposal does not address roll call or t he inherent \ntasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post,\u2019 which could lead to late breaking changes in the specific personnel that may be available to perform on any given day and BEI \u2018scrambl[ing]\u2019 to adjust.\u201d  Id. (citing AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical \nEvaluation at 12.  In this connection, t he protester contends :   \n \nThat concern is not tied to the number of labor hours BEI, or any other offeror, proposes to perform \u201cthe tasks listed in the PWS,\u201d however, as personnel may call out of work on short notice and otherwise must get to work to perform \u201cthe tasks listed in the PWS\u201d regardless of how many  Page 9     B-423385   labor hours an offeror proposed to provide.  Indeed, \u201cthe tasks listed in the \nPWS\u201d do not include, for example, personnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work such that it is patently unreasonable to expect any proposal to address \u201cthe inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u201d let alone to imagine that offerors would \naccount for such time in pricing their proposals.  \n Protest at 23.  The protester characterizes the agency\u2019s EN as \u201cvague,\u201d maintaining that it \u201cdid not provide sufficient information for BEI to understand that it needed to address \u2018roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/t ransported to \npost\u2019 to be competitive for award.\u201d  Id.    \n As an initial matter, we note the protester\u2019s interpretation of the evaluation\u2019s reference to \u201cinherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u201d as  equating \nto \u201cpersonnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work\u201d is a fallacy premised on a false equivalency drawn from the language of the evaluation report.  When read in \ncontext with the preceding sentence\u2019s stated concern that \u201cpersonnel are only responsible for the hours they are on post,\u201d it is clear the evaluators\u2019 reference to there being insufficient hours to account for \u201cinherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u201d relates to various pre- shift and post -shift tasks an employee will \nneed to attend to at the cemetery outside of the normal  operating hours of 8:00 a.m. to \n5:00 p.m.  AR, Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 13; PWS at 6 (specifying the \ncemetery\u2019s normal operating hours) ; see also id. at  41-48 (PWS sections 5.1.1.1, \n5.1.1.2, 5.1.3.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.10, 5.2.10.6, 5.2.12, 5.2.13, 5.2.14, 5.3.1.1, 5.4.1.2, 5.3.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.5.1, 5.5 specifying that various posts are required to be staffed during \nthe entirety of the cemetery\u2019s normal operating hours).   \n \nThe agency explains that \u201c[t]he PWS includes descriptions of the pre and post operational hour tasks in multiple areas,\u201d and that ensuring suffici ent labor hours to \naccount for these tasks was \u201cnot reflected in BEI\u2019s response to the EN\u201d because \u201cthe proposed hours were based on an 8am start time.\u201d  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 5 -6.  For example, section 5.7 of the PWS requires contractor personnel \nto perform daily checks of both government -furnished and contractor -furnished \nscreening equi pment to ensure the equipment is fully operational , and the PWS task  \nestimates some of these checks may take approximately 20 minutes .  PWS at 49 -50; \nsee also AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 5 (proposing to \u201cPerform\/ensure \n[DELETED]. \u201d) and at 6 (similarly proposing to  perform [DELETED] related tasks ).  The \nagency acknowledges that BEI\u2019s response to the EN showed \u201chours proposed for \nVisitor Screeners were based on 9 hours daily (8am - 5pm hours of operation IAW [in \naccordance with] PWS 5.1.1.1 and 5.1.1.2) ,\u201d with additional hours  proposed \u201cfor \n\u2018[DELETED] ,\u2019\u201d but the evaluators found that BEI  still made \u201cno mention of pre- shift \npreparation  or roll up of personnel to assume post positions by the 8am ANC opening \ntime as a factor in BEI\u2019s calculation of hours .\u201d  AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair \nDecl. at 6.  \n  Page 10     B-423385   As another example, some of the post locations necessitate contractor personnel \nopening and closing access doors or other access points prior to the start of and after \nthe end of a shift, respectively.  See e.g., PWS at 44-46 (\u00a7\u00a7 5.2.10, 5.2.12).  A further \nexample, is the PWS\u2019 s description of \u201ca significant amount of equipment, to include \nweather -conditional items which may need to be set -up, taken down, and stored daily \nsuch as umbrellas, tents, heaters, fuel, fans , folding chairs, and outdoor screening \nequipment ,\u201d for which the pre -shift and post -shift set -up and take- down time \u201ccan be \nsignificant , especially considering the time it takes to transport personnel and \nequipment\/supplies to the geographically dispersed post positions\u201d throughout the cemetery.   AR, Tab 1b, Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 6 (citing PWS at  37-38).  \nWhile not an exhaustive recitation of the PWS sections that set forth various \u201cinherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post,\u201d these examples serve to highlight the disingenu ous nature of the protester\u2019s contention that it could not have \nunderstood from the discussions EN that the agency wanted BEI \u2019s proposal  to include \nlabor hours for \u201cpersonnel waking up, putting on clothes, and driving to work.\u201d  Protest at 23.    Turning to BEI\u2019s contention that the EN was vague and failed to provide sufficient information about the specific areas for which the firm needed to provide additional labor hours, we find the protester\u2019s contention unavailing.  The protester maintains that if \u201cthe Agency shared its actual areas of concern, BEI could and would have discussed \u2018roll call [and] the inherent tasks of getting people equipped for the day\/transported to post\u2019 through additional explanation in its proposal and\/or by increasing prop osed labor \nhours to alleviate the Agency\u2019s concerns.\u201d  Protest at 24.    \n \nContrary to the protester\u2019s argument, the record reflect s the EN provided to BEI made \nclear that the evaluators did not believe the protester\u2019s proposal included sufficient labor hours to perform all the PWS tasks.  AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at  1.  The record also \nshows the final evaluation report further elucidates the agency\u2019s concerns  by including  \nexamples of why the evaluators did not consider BEI\u2019s proposed hours sufficient  (e.g., \ncoverage of incidental tasks) .  Compare AR, Tab 39, EN TE -03 at 1 with Tab AR, \nTab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 12- 13.  While the agency could have \ndiscussed these more granular level examples with BEI, there was no requirement that the Army engage in such \u201cspoon -feeding, \u201d and we will not substitute our view for \nmatters within the contracting officer\u2019s judgment.   See e.g., Engility Corp., supra at 9 \n(denying discussions challenge where agency could have discussed additional areas of \nconcern with protester\u2019s proposal, but was not required to do so).  \n Our review of the record finds that t he agency \u2019s discussions properly led BEI to the area \nof concern with its proposal --i.e., insufficient labor hours to perform all PWS tasks.  \nFurther, the agency specifically cautioned, during discussions,  that \u201c[f]ailure to address \nthis finding will likely impact the offeror\u2019s proposal rating when re -evaluated.\u201d   AR, \nTab 39, EN TE -03 at 1.   In response to the EN, BEI made a business judgment to not \nincrease the number of labor hours proposed , but to instead explain why it disagreed \nwith the evaluators\u2019 assessment that the proposed hours were insufficient.  See generally AR, Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.  Ultimately, it was t he protester\u2019s  Page 11     B-423385   business judgment to leave unchanged BEI \u2019s proposed level of staffing that resulted in \nthe negative evaluation, not discussions.  Accordingly, we deny BEI\u2019s challenge to the \nagency\u2019s conduct of discussions.  See e.g., Abacus  Tech. Corp.; SMS Data Prods. \nGroup, Inc., supra at 9 (denying discussions challenge where agency led protester to general area of concern--staffing level for base period--and was under no obligation to \nprovide any additional guidance or proposal direction).  \n \nAssessment of Significant Weakness  \n In addition to protesting about the agency \u2019s conduct of discussions , the protester \ndirectly challenges , as unreasonable,  the assessment of the significant weakness in \nBEI\u2019s proposal for offering insufficient labor hours.  T he protester contends the \nassessed weakness is \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cflawed .\u201d  Protest at 24.  Specifically, the \nprotester maintains  the evaluators unreasonably assessed the weakness because:   \n(1) \u201chistorical staffing levels do not provide a valid comparison because the incumbent \ncontract required more labor hours than the instant effort\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Agency imposed unstated evaluation criteria i n concluding that additional labor hours are required for \ncertain pre-  and post -duty tasks which are not identified in the PWS\u201d; (3) \u201cthe Agency \nignored critical information in BEI\u2019s proposal that directly addresses the Agency\u2019s concerns\u201d; and (4) \u201cBEI proposed significantly more hours than required based on the \npositions and tasks identified in the PWS .\u201d\n6  Id. at 24- 25.  The agency responds that \nBEI\u2019s protest \u201cmerely argues with the evaluation results,\u201d and that such \u201cmere disagreement with the agency\u2019s evaluation does not demonstrate that the agency\u2019s evaluation was unreasonable.\u201d  COS\/MOL at 25.  We agree.  \n \nAs stated above, the task order competition here was conducted pursuant to FAR \nsubpart 16.5. The evaluation of proposals in a task order competition is primarily a \nmatter within the contracting agency \u2019s discretion, because the agency is responsible for \ndefining its needs and the best method of accommodating them. Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc. , supra at 7.  In reviewing protests of an award in a task order competition, \nwe do not reevaluate proposals, but examine the record to determine whether the evaluation and source selection decision are reasonable and consistent with the solicitation \u2019s evaluation criteria and applicable procurement laws and regulations.   \nCACI , Inc.-- Federal, supra at 7.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgment \nof the relative merit of competing proposals, without more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  Id. ; Engility Corp., supra at 4-5.  \n   Use of Historical Staffing Levels in Evaluation of Proposals  \n Relevant here, t he IGE estimated a need for 10 0 FTEs to staff the contract.  AR, \nTab 50, IGE at  1.  The record shows BEI\u2019s proposal offered [DELETED]  FTEs , and was \nassessed a significant weakness  for proposing insufficient labor hours .  AR, Tab 32, BEI \n \n6 The protester raises additional ancillary arguments  challenging the assessed \nsignificant weakness as unreasonable.  While not addressed in our discussion, we have \nconsidered each of these ancillary arguments and find them all to be without merit.   Page 12     B-423385   Final Technical Proposal at 13; Tab 42, BEI Final Technical Evaluation at 9, 12- 13.  In \nchallenging the reasonableness of this  significant weakness , the protester  takes aim at \nthe IGE, arguing it is \u201cvastly overinflated, likely because it appears the Agency based its \nestimates on the expanded but now outdated requirements from the incumbent \ncontract.\u201d  Comments at 13.    \n The protester argues  the agency\u2019s use of historical staffing levels as part of the \nevaluation was unreasonable because those \u201clevels do not provide a valid comparison\u201d to \u201cthe instant effort .\u201d  Protest at 24- 25.  The protester points out that the incumbent \ncontractor is part of BEI\u2019s team, and the firm represents that this provides \u201cTeam BEI\u201d with \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d and \u201can intimate understanding of the staffing levels and skill \nsets required.\u201d  Id. at 26 -27.  Similarly, the protester claims , \u201cthe BEI te am has unique \ninsight  into the labor hours required for successful performance,\u201d and that it \u201creasonably \ndrew\u201d on this \u201cfirsthand knowledge of staffing levels as the incumbent to develop its efficient and realistic proposed level of effort.\u201d  Id.  at 27.   Further, the protester \nmaintains \u201cthe solicitation for the incumbent contract required lengthier hours at each post and a different labor mix as the basis for estimate for the required hours, so the total number of hours on the incumbent contract is mark edly greater than required to \nperform the scope of work under the current Solicitation.\u201d  Id.   \n   \nOur Bid Protest Re gulations require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a \nsolicitation that are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial proposals be filed before that time.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1).   Our timeliness rules reflect the dual \nrequirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or delaying the procurement process.   \nVerizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 260 at 4.  To this \nend, a protester may not wait until after award has been made to protest alleged flaws in the procurement\u2019s ground rules that are apparent prior to submission of proposals.  Microsoft Corp., B -420004, B -420004.2, Oct. 29, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 155 at 30.  \n Here, as discussed above, the solicitation included as t echnical exhibit 3  visitor trends , \nworkload estimates , and stated that while this exhibit did not establish a required level \nof effort  \u201cany proposed deviations shall be clearly explained, and in sufficient enough \ndetail, to demonstrate how the approach meets the Government\u2019s requirements.\u201d  AR, Tab 23, TOEP at 7.   More directly, the solicitation\u2019s evaluation methodology  provided:  \n\u201cIf the Offeror is proposing something not in accordance with historical  hours\/labor, the \nOfferor shall thoroughly detail the rationale for the variance and demonstrate in their proposal the feasibility of this variance.\u201d  Id.   Thus, the solicitation squarely placed \nofferors  on notice that the agency intended to use \u201chistorical hours\/labor\u201d as a \nbenchmark for assessing proposals.    \n If, as expressed in its protest, BEI did not believe that historical staffing levels represented an accurate comparison point for the solicited requirement , the firm was \nrequired to raise that concern prior to the time set for receipt of proposals.   Having \nwaited to protest this issue until after the time set for receipt of proposals and after \naward, BEI\u2019s argument arising from this alleged solicitation impropriety is dismissed as  Page 13     B-423385   untimely .7  See e.g., Microsoft Corp., supra at 30; Facility Healthcare Servs., Inc. , \nB-418743.2, B -418743.3, Sept. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 313 at 7 n.4 (dismissing as \nuntimely post -award argument that comparing proposed prices to IGE was not an \nadequate evaluation method where solicitation informed offerors such an evaluation \ncould take place).  \n   Unstated Evaluation Criteria \n In addition to challenging the accuracy of the IGE used by the agency as a comparative evaluative benchmark, the protester contends the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by downgrading BEI\u2019s proposal for not addressing \u201crequired pre and post shift \ntasks\u201d  that are \u201cnot actually specified in the Solicitation.\u201d   Protest at 27 -28.  Contrary to \nthe protester\u2019s contention, however, and as detailed above, the PWS  included a variety \nof pre- shift and post -shift tasks--e.g., daily equipment checks, opening and closing \naccess to certain parts of the cemetery, etc.   Accordingly, we find no merit in BEI\u2019s claim \nthat the agency applied unstated evaluation criteria by expecting offerors to propose sufficient staff to perform all the tasks set forth in the PWS.  See e.g., CAE USA, Inc. , \nB-421550 et al. , June 22, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 149 at 7 (denying protest allegation that  \nassessment of protester\u2019s staffing used unstated evaluation criteria where the language of the solicitation belied protester\u2019s argument).  \n   Proposal Information and Sufficiency of Proposed Labor Hours  \n The protester further argues that BEI\u2019s proposal did, in fact, address the agency\u2019s \nconcerns related to pre- shift and post -shift tasks by offering \u201cmore hours than required \nby the normal duty hours\u201d to be \u201cmore than sufficient to cover\u201d these various activ ities.  \nProtest at 30.  Speci fically, the protester claims , \u201cBEI proposed significantly more hours \nthan required,\u201d and characterizes the assessed weakness as \u201cunjustified and, frankly, baffling.\u201d  Id.  at 24-25.  In support of this contention, the protester  explains how it \ncalculated the number of labor hours needed, and insists  its methodology resulted in \nBEI proposing hours that were \u201croughly  [DELETED] higher than the Government\u2019s \nstated requirement.\u201d  Id. at 26.  The explanation provided in BEI\u2019s protest, however, is \nsimply a summation of the explanation included in BEI\u2019s proposal and responses to \ndiscussion ENs .  Compare id. with AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13- 14; \nsee also generally  Tab 41, EN TE -03 BEI Response at 2- 4.   \n In this  connection, BEI \u2019s explanation describes how the firm  calculated the number of \nhours required for each post to be continuously staffed  during the cemetery\u2019s operating \nhours  of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m .  For example, for the visitor screener posts, BEI made \n \n7 Although we need not address the merits of this argument, we note the agency \npresented a detailed rebuttal of the protester\u2019s claim that the IGE is inaccurate.  The Army explained that while the incumbent task order, as initially awarded, did require longer hours at various posts, the order was later modified to reduce the \u201chours of operation to those reflected in the current PWS.\u201d  Supp. COS\/MOL at 2; see also generally AR, Tab 56, Supp. Technical Evaluation Chair Decl. at 1- 2.  Page 14     B-423385   one calculation for the 183 days of the summer months when there are 18 screener \nposts to staff and a second calculation for the 182 days of the winter months when there \nare 14  posts to staff.  AR, Tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at 13.  BEI  added \n[DELETED] FTE [DELETED],  resulting in [DELETED] positions  to staff in the summer \nand [DELETED]  in the winter.  Id.  For each season\u2019s calculations, BEI multiplied \n9 hours per day by 183 or 182 days , multiplied that by the number of posts for the \nsummer and winter months, then added the two figures to reach a total number of [DELETED]  hours --or [DELETED] FTEs --needed to staff each of the visitor screener \nposts for exactly 9 hours per day.\n8  Id. at 13-14.  BEI \u2019s proposal also included additional \nhours for [DELETED] , but those hours were specified for those purposes and were not \nrepresented as being available for the performance of pre- shift or post -shift tasks or \ncovering for employee breaks.  Id. at 14.  \n As noted in our assessment of the protester\u2019s discussions challenge, the record shows \nthe evaluators considered the basis for BEI\u2019s labor hour estimate that was included in \nthe firm\u2019s proposal and discussions response, and, notwithstanding these explanations , \nfound the proposed hours insufficient.  Based on the record before us, we find \nimminently reasonable the evaluators\u2019 judgment  that BEI\u2019s approach of providing \nenough FTEs to staff posts for exactly 9 hours per day , without provision for pre-shift \nand post -shift duties outlined in the PWS, and with minimal staffing to cover breaks  \nfailed to provide the amount of support needed to perform the contract , warranting \nassessment of a significant weakness.  While BEI has expressed its disagreement with the evaluators\u2019 judgment in myriad arguments throughout its protest, BEI has not shown \nthat the evaluation was unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation.\n9  Accordingly, \n \n8 Summer ( 9 hours per day * 183  days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) + \nWinter (9 hours per day * 182 days * [DELETED]  posts = [DELETED]  hours) = Total \nAnnual Hours of [DELETED]  divided by [DELETED]  annual hours per FTE = \n[DELETED]  FTEs .  AR, tab 32, BEI Final Technical Proposal at  13-14. \n9 Among the protester\u2019s myriad arguments, is BEI\u2019s assertion that the assessed \nsignificant weakness is unreasonable because it \u201cresulted from a cursory, mechanical \ncomparison of bottom -line numbers between BEI\u2019s proposed labor hours and the IGE.\u201d  \nComments at 23.  The protester claims \u201cthe Agency\u2019s cursory review showed that BEI\u2019s bottom -line numbers were below the IGE, and so, the Agency contrived generic reasons \nas to why that is problematic.\u201d  Id.  at 24.  The record does not support such a finding.  \nRather, as detailed above, the record shows the evaluators fully considered the information in BEI\u2019s proposal and discussions response, and detailed in the contemporaneous evaluation record why that inf ormation was not sufficient to alleviate \nconcerns about the insufficiency of BEI\u2019s proposed labor hours.   \nTo the extent, the protester\u2019s c ontention that the evaluators \u201ccontrived generic reasons\u201d \nfor assessing a significant weakness in BEI\u2019s proposal can be construed as an allegation of bad faith, we find such an allegation meritless.  As a general matter, government officials are presumed to act in good faith, and a protester\u2019s contention that procurement officials were motivated by bias or bad faith must be supported by \n(continued...)

As discussed above, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s \nevaluation of the protester\u2019s proposal.

Nor does the record provide a rational explanation as to the \npurported benefits of the awardee\u2019s proposal which are unmatched by BEI so as to warrant paying the awardee\u2019s substantial price premium.  \nProtest at 40 (internal citations omitted) .

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s past performance as only \nwarranting a rating of \u201c neutral confidence\u201d  and the resulting decision not to award the \nprotester a contract  is denied.  Although the agency unreasonably interpreted the \nsolicitation to prohibit the evaluation of past performance references submitted for  the \nprotester\u2019s corporate affiliate, the neutral confidence rating was nevertheless \nreasonable where the protester failed to ensure that past performance questionnaires for its affiliate\u2019s references were timely submitted to the agency.    \nDECISION  \n Jude & L Construction, LLC (JLC) of Katy, Texas, protests its  non-selection for award of \na multiple award indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity  (IDIQ) contract , under request for \nproposals (RFP) No.  FA491125R0002, issued by the Department of the Air Force, for \nconstruction services at Prince Sultan Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n1  JLC \nchallenges  the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation and resulting award decision.  \n \nWe deny the protest.  \n \n1 The agency ultimately awarded six contracts to:  Astrea Technical Services LLC, of \nDubai, United Arab Emirates; Saudi Naval Support Co., of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; AQ \nGlobal for General Trading & Contracting Co.

The RFP contemplated the award of \ncontracts with 5 -year ordering periods and an aggregate maximum value of \n$100,000,000 across all contracts.\n2  Id. \n \nAwards  of the IDIQ contracts  were to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis  \nconsidering two non- price factors:  technical and past performance.3  AR, Tab 10, RFP, \namend. 4, Section M at 1.  The RFP contemplated a two- step evaluation process.  First, \nthe technical  factor , which was to be evaluated on an acceptable\/unacceptable basis, \nincluded three subfactors:  (i) design package; (ii)  progress schedule;  and \n(iii) material\/labor breakdown.  Id. at 2.  Only those proposals evaluated as being \ntechnically acceptable would advance to the past performance evaluation phase.  Id. \nat 1. \n \nIn phase two, offerors\u2019 past performance would be evaluated for recency, relevancy, \nand quality,  and assessed one of the following overall confidence assessments:  \nsubstantial ; satisfactory ; neutral ; limited ; or n o confidence.  Id. at 3, 5.  Relevant here, a \nsubstantial confidence rating would be warranted where \u201c[b]ased on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,\u201d and a neutral confidence rating \nwould be warranted where \u201c[n]o recent\/relevant performance r ecord is available or the \nofferor\u2019s performance record [and] is so sparse that no meaningful confidence \nassessment rating can be reasonably assigned.\u201d  Id.  The RFP further provided that a \nproposal assigned a neutral confidence rating \u201cmay not be evaluated favorably or \nunfavorably on the factor of past performance.\u201d  Id. \n Relevant to the issues presented in the protest, the RFP\u2019s section L proposal \ninstructions provided that \u201cthe offeror shall submit Past Performance information for \nitself as a prime contractor only,\u201d and that \u201cexperience performing as a subcontractor \nwill not be considered.\u201d  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L at 6 .  The RFP\u2019s section \nM evaluation criteria also explained  that the agency would evaluate the past \nperformance of predecessor companies, affiliates, other divisions, or corporate \nmanagement where the offeror demonstrated  that such third party would be \nmeaningfully involved in the resulting contract.  Specifically, the provision stated:  \n \n2 The agency\u2019s internal acquisition plan anticipated five to seven IDIQ contract awards.  \nAR, Tab 4, Acquisition Plan at 5.  \n3 Price was not to be evaluated for the award of the IDIQ contracts but was to be \nevaluated for the award of the \u201cseed project \u201d task order.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, \nSection M at 5.   Page 3    B-423425   The Government  will take into account past performance information \nregarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or \ncorporate management if such was provided for evaluation and if the offeror\u2019s past performance volume (Volume III) demonstrates the company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for the instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other capabilities demonstrating direct and meaningful involvement in the performance of the proposed instant effort.  Offerors shall clearly indicate \nthe connection or linkage with the predecessor companies.  \n \nAR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 3.  \n   \nAlso relevant, s ection L IIID(5) (a) of the RFP\u2019s instructions required offerors  to exert \ntheir best effort to ensure that two points of contact (POC) for  each past performance \nreference submit ted a completed past performance questionnaire (PPQ)  to the agency  \nby no later than 5 p.m. on January 22, 2025.  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L, \nat 7.  This provision specifically  established that \u201c[t]he responsibility to send out and \ntrack the completion of the Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity).\u201d  Id. \n The RFP provided that the agency intended to award contracts to all responsible \nofferors that were evaluated as technically acceptable with a substantial confidence past performance assessment.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 1 .  The RFP \nfurther provided that the agency would make a comparative analysis of technically acceptable proposals by ranking proposals from highest to lowest in the order of their \npast performance confidence rating, and then integrate the source selection team\u2019s \nevaluations.  Id. \n \nPrior to  the receipt of proposals, JLC and the contracting officer exchanged emails \ndiscussing the various requirements described in sections L and M  pertaining to past \nperformance.  In one exchange, the contracting officer  reiterated to JLC that the agency \nwould not consider information about an offeror\u2019s  past performance as a subcontractor .  \nReq. for Dismissal, attach. 9, Email from Contracting Officer to JLC  at 1.  The \ncontracting officer  then directed JLC to review section M IID(1)(b)\u2019s provision regarding \nthe acceptability of past performance of affiliates.  Id.   \n In a separate email exchange related to the submission of PPQs , the contracting officer  \nstated that he would contact the protester \u2019s POCs for its past performance if the agency \ndid not receive submitted PPQs for the references by the January 22, 2025,  deadline.  \nSpecifically, the contracting officer informed JLC that : \n \n[W]e will reach -out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in \nthe blanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as \nmany qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.   Page 4    B-423425    \nComments at 12.  \n \nThe agency received 18 proposals in response to the RFP, including from JLC.  See \nAR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror at 1.  Relevant here, JLC submitted three past performance references  for consideration.  Two of the references were performed \nby a corporate affiliate as a prime contractor, and one project was performed by a joint venture comprised by JLC and its corporate affiliate.  AR, Tab 13, JLC Past Performance Proposal at 2.  The proposal further explained that the corporate affiliate would be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract by providing design management, finance, procurement and logistics of long lead items, and supporting quality control management.  Id.  \n The agency ultimately declined to consider any of JLC\u2019s three references.  It did not \nconsider the reference performed by the joint venture because the agency found that the contract  was performed outside of the RFP\u2019s recency period.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of \nUnsuccessful Offeror  at 2.  The agency rejected the other two references because t he \ncontracts were performed by an entity other than JLC, and JLC \u201cfailed to sufficiently \nexplain how [it] contributed to the prime contractor\u2019s performance above and beyond \nsubcontracting effort.\u201d  Id. \n Furthermore, the agency concluded that it did not have sufficient quality assessment information about JLC\u2019s performance of the contracts  because the agency did not \nreceive completed PPQs for any of JLC\u2019s  references by the RFP\u2019s prescribed due date.   \nFurthermore, the agency represents that it did not reach out to the POCs for the two \nreferences performed by JLC \u2019s affiliate  because they were not performed by the \nprotester.  See Agency Resp.  to Req. for Supp. Briefing, attach. 1, Decl. of the \nContracting Offi cer at 1- 2.  As a result, the agency assigned the protester\u2019s past \nperformance a rating of neutral confidence.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror \nat 2. \n Consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation criteria and basis of award, the agency subsequently selected for award the six proposals that were evaluated as technically acceptable and had a rating of substantial confidence for past performance.  The source \nselection official further  determined that this number of awardees would \u201cbring the best \ncompetition outcomes for future task orders\u201d and \u201cthe awarded vendor pool is still a desirable outcome to meet future task order requirements.\u201d  AR, Tab 16, Source Select ion Decision at 3.  After the agency provided JLC with a debriefing, this protest \nfollowed.  \n  Page 5    B-423425   DISCUSSION \n JLC presents  two principal  protest issues, both related to how the agency evaluated the \nprotester\u2019s  past performance.\n4  First, JLC contends that the agency erred when it failed \nto consider the past performance of its corporate affiliate that would have meaningful \ninvolvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  See, e.g. , Protest at 1.  In \nparticular, the protester  argues that the agency improperly categorized the past \nperformance of its affiliate  as instances of JLC\u2019s subcontracting experience, which the \nagency would not consider under section L IIID(1)(a)  of the RFP , rather than as past \nperformance of an affiliate company, which the agency was to  consider under section \nM IID(1)(b).  Id. at 2. \n \nThe agency responds that JLC misinterpreted the meaning of these two solicitation provisions .  Memorandum of Law (MOL)  at 8.  The agency argues while the RFP \nallowed an offeror to provide affiliate past performance, the offeror had to establish \u201chow \nit contributed to [the affiliate\u2019s]  prime contractor performance above and beyond a \nsubcontracting effort.\u201d  Id. at 6.  The agency alternatively argues that the sections are in \n\u201cobvious conflict ,\u201d and create a patent ambiguity  that is untimely raised after award.  Id. \nat 8.  In this regard, the agency argues that s ection L IIID(1)(a) excludes all past \nperformance from agency consideration except for the offeror\u2019s  own past performance \nas a prime contractor.  Id.  The agency further contends that to the extent section M \nIID(1)(b) provide d that the agency would consider the past performance of entities \nbesides the offeror  as a prime contractor, such a reading is in clear contradiction with  \n \n4 The protester raises a number of collateral arguments.  While our decision does not \nspecifically address each argument, we have reviewed all  of the arguments and find \nthat none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, JLC argues that it was improperly excluded from award based solely on its neutral past performance confidence rating in a manner contrary to the RFP\u2019s requirement that a neutral confidence rating would not be unfavorably evaluated by the agenc y.  See, e.g. , \nComments at 13.  We disagree.   \nHere, the RFP unambiguously provided that the agency intended to make award to all proposals evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4 at 1.  The record reflects that consistent with the RFP\u2019s unambiguous terms, the source selection official reasonably made award to the six technically acceptable proposals with substantial past performance confidence ratings.  Further, the source selection official ultimately determined that six awards were sufficient to satisfy the government\u2019s requirements and to provide adequate competition at the task order level.  AR, Tab 16, Source Selection Decision at 3.  On this record, we \ndisagree with the protester\u2019s argument that the agency was required to consider proposals beyond those that were evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  See Deloitte Consulting, LLP; Softrams, LLC , \nB-421801.2 et al. , Jan. 30, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 41 at 4 n.2 (denying protest ground that \nthe agency should have made additional awards where the record reasonably supported the agency\u2019s decision as to the number of contracts awarded).   Page 6    B-423425   the section L provision.  Id.  In either case, the agency contends that it reasonably did \nnot consider the corporate affiliate\u2019s past performance references.  \n \nSecond, JLC argues that  to the extent we agree with its interpretation of the \nsolicitation\u2019s provisions discussed above and the agency should have considered its affiliate\u2019s past performance references , the agency  unreasonably  failed to contact the \nPOCs provided in JLC\u2019s proposal, despite the contracting officer  representing that he \nwould do so in a pre- award email exchange with JLC.  Protest at  2-3.  JLC  ultimately  \nconcludes that, had the agency included its affiliate\u2019s  past performance and contacted \nthe listed POCs when evaluating JLC\u2019s past performance, then JLC would have \nreceived a past performance rating of substantial confidence and been selected for a \ncontract award.  Id. at 3. \n For the reasons that follow, we agree with the protester \u2019s interpretation of  the \nsolicitation --it did not limit the agency to considering past performance information about \ncontracts performed by JLC  itself such that the agency could disregard the information \nabout JLC\u2019s affiliate and we reject the agency\u2019s contention that the solicitation was \npatently ambiguous on this point .  Nevertheless , because the protester failed to ensure \nthat the agency timely received PPQs for the references --as it was required to do by the \nunambiguous terms of the RFP --the agency reasonably determined that the absence of \nquality information would support JLC\u2019s rating of  neutral confidence and, therefore, the \nprotester cannot establish any competitive prejudice.  \n Regarding the question of whether the solicitation precluded the agency from \nconsider ing the past performance references of JLC\u2019s affiliate, w here a dispute exists as \nto a solicitation\u2019s actual requirements, we begin by examining the plain language of solicitation.  Harper Constr. Co., Inc. , B-415042, B -415042.2, Nov. 7, 2017, 2018 CPD \n\u00b6 47 at 4.  We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation by reading the solicitation \nas a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a reading.  Desbuild Inc. , \nB-413613.2, Jan.  13, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  23 at 5.  An interpretation is unreasonable if it \nfails to give meaning to all of a solicitation\u2019s provisions, renders any part of the solicitation absurd, surplus, or creates conflicts.  Innovative Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , \nB-419834.2, B -419834.3, Sept . 20, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 319 at 15.   \n If the solicitation language is unambiguous, our inquiry ceases.  Id.  An ambiguity, \nhowever, exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the solicitation are possible.  Colt Def., LLC , B-406696, July 24, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 302 at 8.  If the \nambiguity is an obvious, gross, or glaring error in the solicitation then it is a patent ambiguity.   Id.  A patent ambiguity must be protested prior to the closing time for receipt \nof proposals to be considered timely.   Office Design Grp., B -415411, Jan. 3, 2018, \n2018 CPD \u00b6 43 at 4.   Here, we conclude that the disputed provisions of the solicitation \nare unambiguous, and the agency\u2019s interpretation is  not reasonable.  \n As stated above,  the RFP\u2019s instructions  provided that \u201c [t]he offeror shall submit Past \nPerformance information for itself as a prime contractor only,\u201d and that \u201cexperience  Page 7    B-423425   performing as a subcontractor will not be considered.\u201d  AR, Tab 8,  RFP, amend. 3, \nSection L at 6.  The location of the word \u201conly\u201d in the provision is significant in \ninterpreting its plain meaning.   Here, the \u201conly\u201d relates to the requirement that the cited \npast performance must be as a prime contractor.  JLC additionally argues that this \ninterpretation is further supported by the next sentence of the instruction, which emphasizes that the agency will not consider subcontractor experience.  In sum, we find the interpretation advanced by the protester is reasonable and comports with the plain meaning of the instruction as written.  \n In contrast, the agency advances an unreasonable interpretation which effectively seeks to move the \u201conly\u201d to relate to the offeror itself.  In this regard, the agency\u2019s interpretation that the instruction limits past performance references only to the offer or \nitself effectively would read the instruction as if it were written as the offeror shall submit past performance information only for itself  as a prime contractor.  We do not believe \nthat the agency\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the plain text or import of the instruction.  \n We next consider the evaluation criteria\u2019s provision that the agency would consider the past performance of related entities.  In this regard, the RFP unambiguously states that \u201c[t]he [agency] will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or corporate management if such was provided for evaluation.\u201d AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend.  4, Section M at 3.   The \nprovision further provides that in order to rely on such references, the protester must demonstrate \u201cthe company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for \nthe instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other \ncapabilities.\u201d  Id.  The protester contends that the instruction and evaluation criteri on \ncan be read in a manner that harmonizes and gives effect to both provisions.  Specifically, JLC contends that the instructions require that each past performance reference have been performed as a prime contractor, and the evaluation criteri on \nmakes clear that such references could have been performed either by the offeror or a \nrelated entity that will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  We agree with the protester that this interpretation is reasonable and prov ides \neffect to both provisions.  \n In contrast, w e disagree with the agency\u2019s alternative interpretation of the two \nprovisions, which it  argues imposes a requirement on offerors who include past \nperformance of related entities  to have performed itself on those previous contracts \n\u201cabove and beyond a subcontracting effort.\u201d  MOL at 6.   In this regard, nothing in the \nevaluation criteria require the offeror to demonstrate its performance on the related entity\u2019s past performance references.   Rather,  the relevant evaluation criteri on required \nthat the offeror demonstrate the related entity\u2019s anticipated meaningful involvement on \nthe resulting contract.  Nothing in the RFP instructed  offerors  to describe their own \nperformance on the past performance references submitted on behalf of related entities , \nlet alone establish that such performance was \u201cabove and beyond a subcontracting effort.\u201d  Instead, the plain meaning of this provision instructs the opposite:  that offerors \nmust describe how the related entity  will perform on the present proposed effor t.  Page 8    B-423425    \nIn sum, we find that the solicitation\u2019s past performance requirements were not ambiguous and only the protester\u2019s proffered  interpretation is reasonable.  Therefore, \nwe agree that the agency erred in failing to consider the past performance references submitted on behalf of JLC\u2019s affiliate that was proposed to be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract.  \n This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry.  Specifically, in addition to finding the rejecting the references because they were submitted on behalf of an affiliate, the \nagency also noted that it never received timely PPQs for the references, and, thus, the lack of quality assessment information would nevertheless support JLC\u2019s neutral confidence past performance assessment.\n5  To the extent the agency did not receive \nPPQs, nothing in the solicitation required the agency to affirmatively contact the POCs for the protester\u2019s past performance references.   \n In this regard, Our Office has generally declined to find that an agency has an affirmative obligation to seek out past performance information where the solicitation places the burden on offerors to ensure the timely submission of PPQs.  See, e.g. , \nMicroTechnologies , LLC , B-420196.3, B -420196.4, Jan. 6, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 17 at  9.  \nHere, the RFP unambiguously charged offerors with ensuring that the agency timely received completed PPQs from at least POCs per reference.  Specifically, the RFP stated that each offeror was to \u201cexert your best effort  to ensure that at least two (2) \nPOCs  per relevant contract submitted a completed [PPQ] directly to the Government \n[no later than] 5:00 p.m. on 22 January 2025 for receipt of proposals,\u201d and that  \u201c[t]he responsibility to send out and track the completion of the [PPQs]  rests solely with \nthe offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity) .\u201d  AR, Tab 8, RFP, \namend.  3, Section L at 7.  \n Notwithstanding the plain terms of the solicitation, the protester nevertheless argues that the contracting officer made representations that he would contact past performance reference POCs in the event PPQs were not timely received.  Specifically, the pr otester points to a pre- award email where the contracting officer represented that \nthe agency would:  \n \n[R]each- out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in the \nblanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as \nmany qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.  \n \n \n5 We note that the agency was not obligated to consider a  PPQ that was received \nalmost a month after the submission deadline where the RFP clearly established that it was the protester\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the completed PPQs were received by a prescribed deadline.  See ZemiTek, LLC ; Integrated Fed. Solutions, Inc. , B-415313, \nB-415313.2, Dec.  20, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 181 at 10- 11.  Page 9    B-423425   Comments at 12.  \n \nFor the reasons that follow, we find that the contracting officer\u2019s email, which was not incorporated into the solicitation as an amendment, created a patent ambiguity that needed to be protested prior to the due date for the submission of proposals . \n Under our Bid Protest Regulations, alleged improprieties in a solicitation apparent prior \nto bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals must be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1).  A written communication \nfrom a contracting officer that does not amend the solicitation but is directly contrary to the terms of the solicitation creates a patent ambiguity that must be protested in accordance with the timeliness requirements of 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a) (1).  See, e.g. , \nHarrington, Moran, Barksdale, Inc. , B-401934.2, B -401934.3, Sep. 10, 2010, 2010 CPD \n\u00b6 231 at 5 (dismissing as untimely a post -award argument that an email from the \ncontracting officer created an ambiguity as to the solicitation\u2019s experience requirements); Input Solutions, Inc. , B-294123, Aug. 31, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6  185 at 3- 4 \n(same, where the protester alleged that the agency\u2019s written discussions letter superseded the solicitation\u2019s proposal preparation instructions).  \n To the extent the protester contends that the contracting officer\u2019s email exchange relieved the protester of its non- delegable obligation to ensure the timely submission of \ncompleted PPQs to the agency, such an interpretation would present a patent ambigui ty \nthat needed to be protested prior to the closing date for proposals .  On this record, we \nfind no basis to conclude that the agency was obligated to contact the protester\u2019s PPQ references, and, therefore, find no basis to sustain the protest where the neutral past \nperformance assessment would still be justified based on the lack of any quality related information available for the past performance references of JLC\u2019s affiliate.  \n In conclusion, although we find that the agency improperly evaluated JLC\u2019s past performance when it rejected the past performance of JLC\u2019s  affiliate, we do not find that \nthe agency\u2019s error resulted in competitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an \nessential element of every protest, and requires that a protester prove that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have received the award.  Alexandra Constr., Inc. , B-417212, \nApr. 2, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 132 at 6.  Under the facts here, the protester  did not  suffer  \nany competitive prejudice because, even if the agency had properly considered the past \nperformance of JLC\u2019s affiliate, the agency still would have lacked the PPQs necessary to assess the quality of JLC\u2019s past performance.  As a result, we do not find that JLC \nwould have received a substantial past performance rating in the absence of the \nagency\u2019s error  and, therefore, would not have been in line for award . \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

AR, Tab 5, RFP at 1, 5.  The RFP contemplated the award of \ncontracts with 5 -year ordering periods and an aggregate maximum value of \n$100,000,000 across all contracts.\n2  Id. \n \nAwards  of the IDIQ contracts  were to be made on a best -value tradeoff basis  \nconsidering two non- price factors:  technical and past performance.3  AR, Tab 10, RFP, \namend. 4, Section M at 1.  The RFP contemplated a two- step evaluation process.  First, \nthe technical  factor , which was to be evaluated on an acceptable\/unacceptable basis, \nincluded three subfactors:  (i) design package; (ii)  progress schedule;  and \n(iii) material\/labor breakdown.  Id. at 2.  Only those proposals evaluated as being \ntechnically acceptable would advance to the past performance evaluation phase.  Id. \nat 1. \n \nIn phase two, offerors\u2019 past performance would be evaluated for recency, relevancy, \nand quality,  and assessed one of the following overall confidence assessments:  \nsubstantial ; satisfactory ; neutral ; limited ; or n o confidence.  Id. at 3, 5.  Relevant here, a \nsubstantial confidence rating would be warranted where \u201c[b]ased on the offeror\u2019s recent\/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,\u201d and a neutral confidence rating \nwould be warranted where \u201c[n]o recent\/relevant performance r ecord is available or the \nofferor\u2019s performance record [and] is so sparse that no meaningful confidence \nassessment rating can be reasonably assigned.\u201d  Id.  The RFP further provided that a \nproposal assigned a neutral confidence rating \u201cmay not be evaluated favorably or \nunfavorably on the factor of past performance.\u201d  Id. \n Relevant to the issues presented in the protest, the RFP\u2019s section L proposal \ninstructions provided that \u201cthe offeror shall submit Past Performance information for \nitself as a prime contractor only,\u201d and that \u201cexperience performing as a subcontractor \nwill not be considered.\u201d  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L at 6 .  The RFP\u2019s section \nM evaluation criteria also explained  that the agency would evaluate the past \nperformance of predecessor companies, affiliates, other divisions, or corporate \nmanagement where the offeror demonstrated  that such third party would be \nmeaningfully involved in the resulting contract.  Specifically, the provision stated:  \n \n2 The agency\u2019s internal acquisition plan anticipated five to seven IDIQ contract awards.  \nAR, Tab 4, Acquisition Plan at 5.  \n3 Price was not to be evaluated for the award of the IDIQ contracts but was to be \nevaluated for the award of the \u201cseed project \u201d task order.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, \nSection M at 5.   Page 3    B-423425   The Government  will take into account past performance information \nregarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or \ncorporate management if such was provided for evaluation and if the offeror\u2019s past performance volume (Volume III) demonstrates the company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for the instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other capabilities demonstrating direct and meaningful involvement in the performance of the proposed instant effort.  Offerors shall clearly indicate \nthe connection or linkage with the predecessor companies.  \n \nAR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 3.  \n   \nAlso relevant, s ection L IIID(5) (a) of the RFP\u2019s instructions required offerors  to exert \ntheir best effort to ensure that two points of contact (POC) for  each past performance \nreference submit ted a completed past performance questionnaire (PPQ)  to the agency  \nby no later than 5 p.m. on January 22, 2025.  AR, Tab 8, RFP, amend. 3, Section L, \nat 7.  This provision specifically  established that \u201c[t]he responsibility to send out and \ntrack the completion of the Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity).\u201d  Id. \n The RFP provided that the agency intended to award contracts to all responsible \nofferors that were evaluated as technically acceptable with a substantial confidence past performance assessment.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4, Section M at 1 .  The RFP \nfurther provided that the agency would make a comparative analysis of technically acceptable proposals by ranking proposals from highest to lowest in the order of their \npast performance confidence rating, and then integrate the source selection team\u2019s \nevaluations.  Id. \n \nPrior to  the receipt of proposals, JLC and the contracting officer exchanged emails \ndiscussing the various requirements described in sections L and M  pertaining to past \nperformance.  In one exchange, the contracting officer  reiterated to JLC that the agency \nwould not consider information about an offeror\u2019s  past performance as a subcontractor .  \nReq. for Dismissal, attach. 9, Email from Contracting Officer to JLC  at 1.  The \ncontracting officer  then directed JLC to review section M IID(1)(b)\u2019s provision regarding \nthe acceptability of past performance of affiliates.  Id.   \n In a separate email exchange related to the submission of PPQs , the contracting officer  \nstated that he would contact the protester \u2019s POCs for its past performance if the agency \ndid not receive submitted PPQs for the references by the January 22, 2025,  deadline.  \nSpecifically, the contracting officer informed JLC that : \n \n[W]e will reach -out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in \nthe blanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as \nmany qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.   Page 4    B-423425    \nComments at 12.  \n \nThe agency received 18 proposals in response to the RFP, including from JLC.  See \nAR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror at 1.  Relevant here, JLC submitted three past performance references  for consideration.  Two of the references were performed \nby a corporate affiliate as a prime contractor, and one project was performed by a joint venture comprised by JLC and its corporate affiliate.  AR, Tab 13, JLC Past Performance Proposal at 2.  The proposal further explained that the corporate affiliate would be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract by providing design management, finance, procurement and logistics of long lead items, and supporting quality control management.  Id.  \n The agency ultimately declined to consider any of JLC\u2019s three references.  It did not \nconsider the reference performed by the joint venture because the agency found that the contract  was performed outside of the RFP\u2019s recency period.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of \nUnsuccessful Offeror  at 2.  The agency rejected the other two references because t he \ncontracts were performed by an entity other than JLC, and JLC \u201cfailed to sufficiently \nexplain how [it] contributed to the prime contractor\u2019s performance above and beyond \nsubcontracting effort.\u201d  Id. \n Furthermore, the agency concluded that it did not have sufficient quality assessment information about JLC\u2019s performance of the contracts  because the agency did not \nreceive completed PPQs for any of JLC\u2019s  references by the RFP\u2019s prescribed due date.   \nFurthermore, the agency represents that it did not reach out to the POCs for the two \nreferences performed by JLC \u2019s affiliate  because they were not performed by the \nprotester.  See Agency Resp.  to Req. for Supp. Briefing, attach. 1, Decl. of the \nContracting Offi cer at 1- 2.  As a result, the agency assigned the protester\u2019s past \nperformance a rating of neutral confidence.  AR, Tab 19, Notice of Unsuccessful Offeror \nat 2. \n Consistent with the agency\u2019s evaluation criteria and basis of award, the agency subsequently selected for award the six proposals that were evaluated as technically acceptable and had a rating of substantial confidence for past performance.  The source \nselection official further  determined that this number of awardees would \u201cbring the best \ncompetition outcomes for future task orders\u201d and \u201cthe awarded vendor pool is still a desirable outcome to meet future task order requirements.\u201d  AR, Tab 16, Source Select ion Decision at 3.  After the agency provided JLC with a debriefing, this protest \nfollowed.  \n  Page 5    B-423425   DISCUSSION \n JLC presents  two principal  protest issues, both related to how the agency evaluated the \nprotester\u2019s  past performance.\n4  First, JLC contends that the agency erred when it failed \nto consider the past performance of its corporate affiliate that would have meaningful \ninvolvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  See, e.g. , Protest at 1.  In \nparticular, the protester  argues that the agency improperly categorized the past \nperformance of its affiliate  as instances of JLC\u2019s subcontracting experience, which the \nagency would not consider under section L IIID(1)(a)  of the RFP , rather than as past \nperformance of an affiliate company, which the agency was to  consider under section \nM IID(1)(b).  Id. at 2. \n \nThe agency responds that JLC misinterpreted the meaning of these two solicitation provisions .  Memorandum of Law (MOL)  at 8.  The agency argues while the RFP \nallowed an offeror to provide affiliate past performance, the offeror had to establish \u201chow \nit contributed to [the affiliate\u2019s]  prime contractor performance above and beyond a \nsubcontracting effort.\u201d  Id. at 6.  The agency alternatively argues that the sections are in \n\u201cobvious conflict ,\u201d and create a patent ambiguity  that is untimely raised after award.  Id. \nat 8.  In this regard, the agency argues that s ection L IIID(1)(a) excludes all past \nperformance from agency consideration except for the offeror\u2019s  own past performance \nas a prime contractor.  Id.  The agency further contends that to the extent section M \nIID(1)(b) provide d that the agency would consider the past performance of entities \nbesides the offeror  as a prime contractor, such a reading is in clear contradiction with  \n \n4 The protester raises a number of collateral arguments.  While our decision does not \nspecifically address each argument, we have reviewed all  of the arguments and find \nthat none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  For example, JLC argues that it was improperly excluded from award based solely on its neutral past performance confidence rating in a manner contrary to the RFP\u2019s requirement that a neutral confidence rating would not be unfavorably evaluated by the agenc y.  See, e.g. , \nComments at 13.  We disagree.   \nHere, the RFP unambiguously provided that the agency intended to make award to all proposals evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend. 4 at 1.  The record reflects that consistent with the RFP\u2019s unambiguous terms, the source selection official reasonably made award to the six technically acceptable proposals with substantial past performance confidence ratings.  Further, the source selection official ultimately determined that six awards were sufficient to satisfy the government\u2019s requirements and to provide adequate competition at the task order level.  AR, Tab 16, Source Selection Decision at 3.  On this record, we \ndisagree with the protester\u2019s argument that the agency was required to consider proposals beyond those that were evaluated as technically acceptable with substantial past performance confidence.  See Deloitte Consulting, LLP; Softrams, LLC , \nB-421801.2 et al. , Jan. 30, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 41 at 4 n.2 (denying protest ground that \nthe agency should have made additional awards where the record reasonably supported the agency\u2019s decision as to the number of contracts awarded).   Page 6    B-423425   the section L provision.  Id.  In either case, the agency contends that it reasonably did \nnot consider the corporate affiliate\u2019s past performance references.  \n \nSecond, JLC argues that  to the extent we agree with its interpretation of the \nsolicitation\u2019s provisions discussed above and the agency should have considered its affiliate\u2019s past performance references , the agency  unreasonably  failed to contact the \nPOCs provided in JLC\u2019s proposal, despite the contracting officer  representing that he \nwould do so in a pre- award email exchange with JLC.  Protest at  2-3.  JLC  ultimately  \nconcludes that, had the agency included its affiliate\u2019s  past performance and contacted \nthe listed POCs when evaluating JLC\u2019s past performance, then JLC would have \nreceived a past performance rating of substantial confidence and been selected for a \ncontract award.  Id. at 3. \n For the reasons that follow, we agree with the protester \u2019s interpretation of  the \nsolicitation --it did not limit the agency to considering past performance information about \ncontracts performed by JLC  itself such that the agency could disregard the information \nabout JLC\u2019s affiliate and we reject the agency\u2019s contention that the solicitation was \npatently ambiguous on this point .  Nevertheless , because the protester failed to ensure \nthat the agency timely received PPQs for the references --as it was required to do by the \nunambiguous terms of the RFP --the agency reasonably determined that the absence of \nquality information would support JLC\u2019s rating of  neutral confidence and, therefore, the \nprotester cannot establish any competitive prejudice.  \n Regarding the question of whether the solicitation precluded the agency from \nconsider ing the past performance references of JLC\u2019s affiliate, w here a dispute exists as \nto a solicitation\u2019s actual requirements, we begin by examining the plain language of solicitation.  Harper Constr. Co., Inc. , B-415042, B -415042.2, Nov. 7, 2017, 2018 CPD \n\u00b6 47 at 4.  We resolve questions of solicitation interpretation by reading the solicitation \nas a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with such a reading.  Desbuild Inc. , \nB-413613.2, Jan.  13, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  23 at 5.  An interpretation is unreasonable if it \nfails to give meaning to all of a solicitation\u2019s provisions, renders any part of the solicitation absurd, surplus, or creates conflicts.  Innovative Mgmt. Concepts, Inc. , \nB-419834.2, B -419834.3, Sept . 20, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 319 at 15.   \n If the solicitation language is unambiguous, our inquiry ceases.  Id.  An ambiguity, \nhowever, exists where two or more reasonable interpretations of the solicitation are possible.  Colt Def., LLC , B-406696, July 24, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 302 at 8.  If the \nambiguity is an obvious, gross, or glaring error in the solicitation then it is a patent ambiguity.   Id.  A patent ambiguity must be protested prior to the closing time for receipt \nof proposals to be considered timely.   Office Design Grp., B -415411, Jan. 3, 2018, \n2018 CPD \u00b6 43 at 4.   Here, we conclude that the disputed provisions of the solicitation \nare unambiguous, and the agency\u2019s interpretation is  not reasonable.  \n As stated above,  the RFP\u2019s instructions  provided that \u201c [t]he offeror shall submit Past \nPerformance information for itself as a prime contractor only,\u201d and that \u201cexperience  Page 7    B-423425   performing as a subcontractor will not be considered.\u201d  AR, Tab 8,  RFP, amend. 3, \nSection L at 6.  The location of the word \u201conly\u201d in the provision is significant in \ninterpreting its plain meaning.   Here, the \u201conly\u201d relates to the requirement that the cited \npast performance must be as a prime contractor.  JLC additionally argues that this \ninterpretation is further supported by the next sentence of the instruction, which emphasizes that the agency will not consider subcontractor experience.  In sum, we find the interpretation advanced by the protester is reasonable and comports with the plain meaning of the instruction as written.  \n In contrast, the agency advances an unreasonable interpretation which effectively seeks to move the \u201conly\u201d to relate to the offeror itself.  In this regard, the agency\u2019s interpretation that the instruction limits past performance references only to the offer or \nitself effectively would read the instruction as if it were written as the offeror shall submit past performance information only for itself  as a prime contractor.  We do not believe \nthat the agency\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the plain text or import of the instruction.  \n We next consider the evaluation criteria\u2019s provision that the agency would consider the past performance of related entities.  In this regard, the RFP unambiguously states that \u201c[t]he [agency] will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies (if used), affiliates, other divisions, or corporate management if such was provided for evaluation.\u201d AR, Tab 10, RFP, amend.  4, Section M at 3.   The \nprovision further provides that in order to rely on such references, the protester must demonstrate \u201cthe company, affiliate, or division will provide the offeror with resources for \nthe instant proposed effort, such as workforce, management, facilities, or other \ncapabilities.\u201d  Id.  The protester contends that the instruction and evaluation criteri on \ncan be read in a manner that harmonizes and gives effect to both provisions.  Specifically, JLC contends that the instructions require that each past performance reference have been performed as a prime contractor, and the evaluation criteri on \nmakes clear that such references could have been performed either by the offeror or a \nrelated entity that will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the resulting contract.  We agree with the protester that this interpretation is reasonable and prov ides \neffect to both provisions.  \n In contrast, w e disagree with the agency\u2019s alternative interpretation of the two \nprovisions, which it  argues imposes a requirement on offerors who include past \nperformance of related entities  to have performed itself on those previous contracts \n\u201cabove and beyond a subcontracting effort.\u201d  MOL at 6.   In this regard, nothing in the \nevaluation criteria require the offeror to demonstrate its performance on the related entity\u2019s past performance references.   Rather,  the relevant evaluation criteri on required \nthat the offeror demonstrate the related entity\u2019s anticipated meaningful involvement on \nthe resulting contract.  Nothing in the RFP instructed  offerors  to describe their own \nperformance on the past performance references submitted on behalf of related entities , \nlet alone establish that such performance was \u201cabove and beyond a subcontracting effort.\u201d  Instead, the plain meaning of this provision instructs the opposite:  that offerors \nmust describe how the related entity  will perform on the present proposed effor t.  Page 8    B-423425    \nIn sum, we find that the solicitation\u2019s past performance requirements were not ambiguous and only the protester\u2019s proffered  interpretation is reasonable.  Therefore, \nwe agree that the agency erred in failing to consider the past performance references submitted on behalf of JLC\u2019s affiliate that was proposed to be meaningfully involved in performance of the resulting contract.  \n This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry.  Specifically, in addition to finding the rejecting the references because they were submitted on behalf of an affiliate, the \nagency also noted that it never received timely PPQs for the references, and, thus, the lack of quality assessment information would nevertheless support JLC\u2019s neutral confidence past performance assessment.\n5  To the extent the agency did not receive \nPPQs, nothing in the solicitation required the agency to affirmatively contact the POCs for the protester\u2019s past performance references.   \n In this regard, Our Office has generally declined to find that an agency has an affirmative obligation to seek out past performance information where the solicitation places the burden on offerors to ensure the timely submission of PPQs.  See, e.g. , \nMicroTechnologies , LLC , B-420196.3, B -420196.4, Jan. 6, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 17 at  9.  \nHere, the RFP unambiguously charged offerors with ensuring that the agency timely received completed PPQs from at least POCs per reference.  Specifically, the RFP stated that each offeror was to \u201cexert your best effort  to ensure that at least two (2) \nPOCs  per relevant contract submitted a completed [PPQ] directly to the Government \n[no later than] 5:00 p.m. on 22 January 2025 for receipt of proposals,\u201d and that  \u201c[t]he responsibility to send out and track the completion of the [PPQs]  rests solely with \nthe offeror (i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity) .\u201d  AR, Tab 8, RFP, \namend.  3, Section L at 7.  \n Notwithstanding the plain terms of the solicitation, the protester nevertheless argues that the contracting officer made representations that he would contact past performance reference POCs in the event PPQs were not timely received.  Specifically, the pr otester points to a pre- award email where the contracting officer represented that \nthe agency would:  \n \n[R]each- out ourselves and request the information direct[ly] to fill in the \nblanks in the event there [are] no PPQs submitted.  We want to get as \nmany qualified contractors on this requirement as possible and will work diligently to get the information we need to make a sufficient evaluation of performance.  \n \n \n5 We note that the agency was not obligated to consider a  PPQ that was received \nalmost a month after the submission deadline where the RFP clearly established that it was the protester\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the completed PPQs were received by a prescribed deadline.  See ZemiTek, LLC ; Integrated Fed. Solutions, Inc. , B-415313, \nB-415313.2, Dec.  20, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 181 at 10- 11.  Page 9    B-423425   Comments at 12.  \n \nFor the reasons that follow, we find that the contracting officer\u2019s email, which was not incorporated into the solicitation as an amendment, created a patent ambiguity that needed to be protested prior to the due date for the submission of proposals . \n Under our Bid Protest Regulations, alleged improprieties in a solicitation apparent prior \nto bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals must be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1).  A written communication \nfrom a contracting officer that does not amend the solicitation but is directly contrary to the terms of the solicitation creates a patent ambiguity that must be protested in accordance with the timeliness requirements of 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a) (1).  See, e.g. , \nHarrington, Moran, Barksdale, Inc. , B-401934.2, B -401934.3, Sep. 10, 2010, 2010 CPD \n\u00b6 231 at 5 (dismissing as untimely a post -award argument that an email from the \ncontracting officer created an ambiguity as to the solicitation\u2019s experience requirements); Input Solutions, Inc. , B-294123, Aug. 31, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6  185 at 3- 4 \n(same, where the protester alleged that the agency\u2019s written discussions letter superseded the solicitation\u2019s proposal preparation instructions).  \n To the extent the protester contends that the contracting officer\u2019s email exchange relieved the protester of its non- delegable obligation to ensure the timely submission of \ncompleted PPQs to the agency, such an interpretation would present a patent ambigui ty \nthat needed to be protested prior to the closing date for proposals .  On this record, we \nfind no basis to conclude that the agency was obligated to contact the protester\u2019s PPQ references, and, therefore, find no basis to sustain the protest where the neutral past \nperformance assessment would still be justified based on the lack of any quality related information available for the past performance references of JLC\u2019s affiliate.  \n In conclusion, although we find that the agency improperly evaluated JLC\u2019s past performance when it rejected the past performance of JLC\u2019s  affiliate, we do not find that \nthe agency\u2019s error resulted in competitive prejudice.  Competitive prejudice is an \nessential element of every protest, and requires that a protester prove that, but for the agency\u2019s actions, it would have received the award.  Alexandra Constr., Inc. , B-417212, \nApr. 2, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 132 at 6.  Under the facts here, the protester  did not  suffer  \nany competitive prejudice because, even if the agency had properly considered the past \nperformance of JLC\u2019s affiliate, the agency still would have lacked the PPQs necessary to assess the quality of JLC\u2019s past performance.  As a result, we do not find that JLC \nwould have received a substantial past performance rating in the absence of the \nagency\u2019s error  and, therefore, would not have been in line for award . \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n "

        "Summary":"1.  Protest challenging the evaluation of the protester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s past performance is denied where the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms \nof the solicitation.  \n 2.  Protest that the agency performed a flawed best -value determination is denied \nwhere the agency\u2019s tradeoff was  reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation.  \nDECISION  \n Guidehouse Inc., of McLean, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to BDO Public Sector, LLC, (BDO) of McLean, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 70RCSJ24Q00000072, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, \nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA), for internal control assessment and \nremediation management support services.  The protester contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s quotations was unreasonable, and resulted in a flawed best -value decision.  \n We deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423156.2  BACKGROUND  \n \nOn July 19, 2024, the agency issued the RFQ for the placement of an order under the General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedule, Special Item Number 541219 (Budget and Financial Management Services), for internal control support services for th e CISA Office of Chief Financial Officer Internal Control Subdivision.  \nAgency Report (AR), Tab 3.a, Statement of Work (SOW) at 1- 2.  The RFQ, which the \nagency amended once, contemplated issuance of a hybrid fixed- price\/time -and-\nmaterials task order with an anticipated task order term of one base year, and two, 1-year options.  Id.  at 2; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement at 2.  \n The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis \nconsidering price and three non- price factors (which are listed in descending order of \nimportance):  management and staffing approach; past performance; and price.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 9- 10.  When the non- price \nevaluation factors were combined, they were more important than the price factor.  Id.  \nat 10.  The RFQ, however, further advised vendors that the agency would not issue an \naward to a vendor  \u201cwho presents a considerably higher overall price to achieve only \nslightly better performance capabilities.  Consequently, as non- price evaluations \nbecome more equal, price may be of greater significance in the trade- off consideration.\u201d  \nId.  Only the past performance factor is relevant to the issues presented in this protest.  \n As to past performance, vendors were to provide up to three past performance references that demonstrated at least two years of experience performing the type of work described in the statement of work (SOW).  Id. at 8.  The past performance \nreferences needed to include work similar in nature to the requirement and be drawn from work ongoing or completed within the previous five years from the date of RFQ release.   Id. \n For the past performance factor, the agency would evaluate the relevance of past performance and how well the vendor performed.  Id. at 10.  The agency would consider \npast performance relevant if it was like the solicitation\u2019s requirement in both size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).  Id.  The more relevant the past performance, the stronger predictor of future \nsuccess and, thus, more influence on the past performance risk assessment.  Id.  The \nagency would provide one rating under this factor according to the following scale:    Page 3 B-423156.2  Confidence \nLevel Rating  Definition  \nLow Risk  The Quoter\u2019s record of past performance indicates there is very little \nrisk associated with receiving timely services of the highest quality. \nThe Quoter\u2019s past performance shows a pattern of consistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter will likely meet or possibly \nexceed the requirements of the task order.  \nMedium Risk  The Quoter\u2019s record of past performance indicates that there is \nsome potential risk associated with receiving timely services of the \nhighest quality. The Quoter\u2019s past performance reflects instances of inconsistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter may not meet the \nrequirements of the task order.  \nHigh Risk  The Quoter\u2019s record of past performance shows a pattern of poor \npast performance, including quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating a high likelihood that the Quoter will \nconsistently fail to meet the requirements of the task order.  \nNeutral  Quoter has no relevant or recent past performance, or there is no \nrecord of past performance of Quoter available for evaluation.  \n Id. at 11- 12.  \n The agency received six quotations, including one from the protester and BDO.  See AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 4.  On October 25, 2024, following \nevaluations, the agency notified the protester that it had issued the subject order to \nBDO.

In response to Guidehouse\u2019s request for a brief explanation, the agency disclosed the following evaluation results for BDO and \nGuidehouse:  \n \nContractor  Factor 1 \n(Management & \nStaffing \nApproach)  Factor 2 (Past \nPerformance)  Factor 3 \n(Price)  Quoted Price  \nBDO  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $10,196,570.06  \nGuidehouse  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $13,345,430.25  \n AR, Tab 9, Brief Explanation, at 1.  \n On November 4, Guidehouse filed a protest with our Office, which we docketed as B-423156.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. at 2.  On November 27, the \nagency filed a request to dismiss the protest as academic based on the agency\u2019s \nproposed corrective action to reevaluate quotations and conduct a new best -value \ndetermination.  AR, Tab 10, Notice of Corrective Action & Req. to Dismiss.  We \nsubsequently dismissed the protest as academic .  See Guidehouse, Inc. , B-423156 \n(Dec. 3, 2024) (unpublished decision).   Page 4 B-423156.2   \nAs part of the corrective action, both the technical evaluation team (TET) and business evaluation committee (BEC) met to reevaluate Guidehouse\u2019s and BDO\u2019s quotations under the non- price evaluation factors.   The TET completed its reevaluation and issued \nan updated technical evaluation report for the management and staffing approach; the ratings for this factor did not change.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. \nat 2. \n As to past performance, the BEC confirmed the prior low risk ratings assigned to both vendors, but also provided a detailed analysis of the recency, relevance, and quality for each past performance reference for each vendor.  In terms of relevance, the BEC  first \nconsidered the dollar value of the reference, the percentage of work completed by the performing entity (either the prime vendor itself or one of its proposed subcontractors), as well as the number of full -time equivalents employed by the performing entity.  See, \ne.g., AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Perf. Eval. Rep. at 5.  Based on this initial \nrelevance analysis, the BEC determined that two of BDO\u2019s past performance references, one for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant, and all three of Guidehouse\u2019s references, two for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant.  See id.  at 10- 11, 28.  \n For each relevant reference, the BEC next considered the percentage of tasks performed under the past performance reference as compared to the tasks required by the SOW for the instant requirement.  A summary of the BEC\u2019s analysis is as follows:  \n \nSOW Task  Relevance  \nRelevant  Not Relevant  \nBDO Reference #1  \nTask 1  X (76% of tasks)   \nTask 2  X (44% of tasks)   \nTask 3  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 4  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 5   X (0% of tasks)  \nBDO Reference #3 (for subcontractor)  \nTask 1  X (70%)   \nTask 2  X (33%)   \nTask 3  X (100%)   \nTask 4  X (100%)   \nTask 5  X (75%)   \n Id. at 4-5, 8-10. \n  Page 5 B-423156.2  SOW Task  Relevance  \nRelevant  Not Relevant  \nGuidehouse Reference #1  \nTask 1  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 2  X (88% of tasks)   \nTask 3  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 4  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 5  X (100% of tasks)   \nGuidehouse Reference #2  \nTask 1  X (82%)   \nTask 2  X (55%)   \nTask 3  X (100%)   \nTask 4  X (100%)   \nTask 5   X (0%)  \nGuidehouse Reference #3 (for subcontractor)  \nTask 1  X (94%)   \nTask 2  X (44%)   \nTask 3  X (100%)   \nTask 4  X (100%)   \nTask 5  X (75%)   \n \nId. at 23- 28. \n In assigning BDO an overall low risk rating, the BEC recognized that, between both of its references, BDO demonstrated relevant experience with the type of work required by \nthe SOW, \u201cthough relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 [were] on the lighter side as a \nwhole.\u201d  Id. at 10.  The BEC, however, explained that the lack of relevant experience \nwith some subtasks, while noted, did \u201cnot present a genuine concern about ability to perform them,\u201d and that both BDO and its subcontractor had both demonstrated their ability to lead performance related to at least tasks 1 through 4, and BDO\u2019s proposed \nsubcontractor had relevant experience performing task 5.  Id. at 10 -11. \n The source selection official\u2019s subsequent award decision reaffirmed the award to BDO.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 10.  The contracting officer, who was the source selection official, expressly agreed with the BEC\u2019s past performance evaluation findings.  Id.  at 3.  In his tradeoff analysis, the contracting officer \nexpressly recognized that Guidehouse, the incumbent, had more relevant past performance and other non- price advantages based on its incumbency, but those \nbenefits were not worth a $3.1 million (or 23.6 percent) price premium.  Specifically, the \ncontracting officer explained that:  \n While Guidehouse Inc. does show both strong institutional knowledge of CISA\u2019s Internal Controls program (and is the incumbent, automatically presenting less transition risk) and provided more references of performing similar work as a prime contractor, I do not believe this is worth an extra $3.1 [million].  The CISA Internal Controls program has matured, and the  Page 6 B-423156.2  risk of stoppage or complete failure due to transitioning to a new team is \nminimal.  While BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse, their experience was enough to garner a Low Risk rating and the Government has no concerns that BDO has the \nexperience to provide quality work.  Therefore, Guidehouse Inc.\u2019s solution is not worth the 23.60 [percent] price premium compared to BDO Public Sector LLC\u2019s Quote.  \n AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.    \n On February 10, 2025, the agency notified Guidehouse that it had confirmed award to BDO.  AR, Tab 15, Second Notice of Award, at 1.  On February 10, the agency provided the protester a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 16, Brief Explanation to Guidehouse at 1.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  Guidehouse raises two primary protest grounds.\n1  First, the protester challenges the \nreasonableness of the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  Comments at  2.  \nSecond, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff is flawed, contending \nthat the agency unreasonably found the awardee to be low risk under the past \nperformance factor and that the agency unreasonably elevated the importance of price in making its selection decision.  Id.  at 9.  We find no basis to sustain the protest.  \n Past Performance Evaluation  \n Guidehouse argues that the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation of both the awardee\u2019s and protester\u2019s past performance references was unreasonable.\n2  Regarding \n \n1 Guidehouse also initially alleged that (i) the agency misevaluated its proposal under \nthe staffing and management approach factor, and (ii) BDO should have received a lower past performance rating based on alleged adverse performance about BDO\u2019s corporate parent, but the protester subsequently withdrew those allegations.  See \nComments at 1 n.1.  \n2 The protester raises other collateral arguments.  While this decision does not \nspecifically address all of the protester\u2019s arguments, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  As one example, the protester argues that the agency , \nin assigning the awardee a low risk past performance rating, ignored BDO\u2019s lack of past performance references involving work for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which Guidehouse argues was required by the RFQ.  Comments at 7.  We find no meri t \nto this argument.  First, the relevant past performance evaluation criteria did not specifically limit relevance only to prior work performed for DHS.  In this regard, the RFQ only required offerors to demonstrate past performance that included work \u201csim ilar \nin nature to this requirement.\u201d  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  As discussed herein, the agency reasonably evaluated past \n(continued...)   Page 7 B-423156.2  the awardee\u2019s quotation, the protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated \nthe relevance of BDO\u2019s past performance references and the agency overlooked the risks of BDO\u2019s allegedly limited past performance record.  Comments at 2- 9.  The \nprotester also contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s quotation was unreasonable because the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative differences between itself and the awardee\u2019s past performance.  Id.  at 9-11.  The agency maintains \nthat its past performance evaluation of both quotations was reasonable and in accordance with the terms of the RFQ, and that the protester\u2019s allegations reflect nothing more than Guidehouse\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s e valuation.  \nMemorandum of Law at 3.  As addressed below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  \n When a protester challenges an agency \u2019s past performance evaluation, we will review \nthe evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019 s \nevaluation criteria, and procurement statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency \u2019s rationale is adequately documented.  D&G Support Services, LLC , B-419245, \nB-419245.3, Jan. 6, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b615 at 8.  An agency \u2019s evaluation of past \nperformance, including its consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of a vendor \u2019s performance history, is a matter of discretion, which we will not disturb unless \nthe agency \u2019s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria.  \nSee Sterling Medical Associates, Inc. , B-418674, B-418674.2, July 23, 2020, 2020 CPD \n\u00b6 255 at 8.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the agency \u2019s judgment , without more,  does \nnot establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  FN Mfg., LLC , B-402059.4, \nB-402059.5, Mar. 22, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6104 at 7.  \n \n \nperformance references for relevance considering size, scope, and complexity as compared to the requirements of the SOW.  \nSecond, we also find no basis for the protester\u2019s intimation that the SOW imposed additional past performance relevance requirements beyond the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency was required to evaluate specific demonstrated knowledge with each of the multitude of federal laws \nand policies enumerated in the SOW, most namely the DHS Financial Accountability Act (DHS FAA).  In support of this position, the protester highlights the section of the \nSOW, which explained that the contractor must possess a comprehensive and working knowledge of federal laws and policies with respect to internal controls, including the \nDHS FAA.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. 1, Updated SOW, at 1- 2.  We do not agree.  \nRather, the agency reasonably considered relevance on the basis of a vendor\u2019s demonstrated experience with federal internal control laws and policies generally, absent a specific solici tation requirement for vendors to demonstrate specific \nexperience with each enumerated law or policy.  Additionally, we note that the agency specifically credited Guidehouse in the tradeoff with its \u201cstrong institutional knowledge of CISA\u2019s Internal Contro ls program\u201d and depth of experience garnered as the incumbent.  \nAR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  \n   Page 8 B-423156.2  The RFQ instructed vendors to submit up to three past performance references \u201cdrawn \nfrom work ongoing or completed within the previous five (5) years from the date of solicitation release.\u201d  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  The RFQ required the references to include work similar in nature to the requirement.  Id.  Past performance would be considered relevant if it was \u201clike the requirement in \nboth size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).\u201d Id.   \n The RFQ explained that the agency would assess each past performance reference to determine the likelihood of the vendor successfully performing the prospective task order.  Id. at 10.  The agency\u2019s assessment would consider whether the past \nperformance reference was relevant as well as the reference\u2019s history of quality, schedule, cost control, and management.  Id.  To evaluate relevance, the BEC \nassessed each past performance reference to determine if it demonstrated performance of five of the eight tasks  required by the RFQ.\n3  Id.  In addition to the information \nprovided, the agency\u2019s evaluation would also consider information provided through \nelectronic government databases including, but not limited to, the Contractor \nPerformance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).4  Id.  The agency would then \ndetermine the level of risk for a vendor\u2019s potential performance based on the vendor\u2019s \noverall relevant past performance.  Id.  \n As discussed above, BDO submitted three past performance references in its quotation, two of which the agency found to be recent and relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13, Past Performance Report at 10.  The BEC, after reviewing the quality information available for these two recent and relevant references, ultimately concluded that BDO\u2019s \npast performance presented low risk to the government.  Specifically, the BEC determined that:  \n \nThe past performance references were all found to be recent. Reference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 \nhad too few FTE\u2019s [full -time equivalents] to be considered relevant in size.  \nBetween all references, relevance in scope to CISA\u2019s requirement was \n \n3 The SOW includes eight tasks:  (1) internal control assessment, corrective action \nplanning, and remediation support; (2) data analytics and automation technical support; (3) technical support; (4) project management; (5) audit liaison (optional); (6) surge internal control assessments and remediation special projections (optional); (7) software licenses; and (8) travel.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated SOW, at 2 -8.  \nBecause task six was identical in scope to tasks one and four, and tasks seven and eight were not to be evaluated under the past performance factor, only the first five tasks were assessed for relevance.  AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Performance Report, at 4 n.1.  \n4 The CPARS evaluation consisted of six evaluative areas:  quality; schedule; cost \ncontrol; management; small business subcontracting; regulatory compliance; and other: product\/service delivery.  Id. at 6; Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.1503(b)(2).   Page 9 B-423156.2  demonstrated, though relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 are on the lighter \nside as a whole. The lacking relevance in some sub -tasks is noted, but \ndoes not present a genuine concern about ability to perform them as written in the SOW.  The quality of each refence was found to be positive, \nwith each rated factor being given a \u201cVery Good\u201d or \u201cExceptional\u201d rating.  . . .  Of the two references relevant in size, one was led by BDO as \nthe prime and one was led by their proposed subcontractor  [ ] as the \nprime.   While [BDO\u2019s subcontractor]  is the only reference that showed \nperformance related to Task 5, both BDO and [BDO\u2019s subcontractor]  \ndemonstrated leading performance related to tasks 1 \u2013  4.  Due to all \nfactors discussed above, we have rated BDO PUBLIC SECTOR, LLC as LOW RISK for this past performance evaluation.  \n Id. at 10- 11.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the BEC\u2019s past \nperformance evaluation.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 3.  \n Guidehouse also submitted three past performance references, all three of which the agency found to be relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 28.  With respect to Guidehouse\u2019s past performance references, the evaluators found the following:  \n \nThe past performance references were found to be recent, relevant in size, and relevant in scope to CISA\u2019s requirement though relevance to \nTask 5 is on the lighter side as a whole.  The lacking relevance in some \nsub-tasks is noted, but does not present a genuine concern about ability to \nperform them as written in the SOW.  Guidehouse led all work as prime in \nthe submitted references.  The quality of each refence was found to be \npositive, with each rated factor being given an \u201cExceptional\u201d rating. \nTherefore,  we have rated GUIDEHOUSE LLP as  LOW RISK for  this past \nperformance evaluation.  \n Id.  Based on its review, the agency assigned an overall past performance risk rating of \n\u201clow risk\u201d for Guidehouse.  Id.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the \nBEC\u2019s evaluation of Guidehouse\u2019s past performance.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action \nAward Decision Document at 3.   \n The contracting officer in conducting his tradeoff analysis also expressly recognized that Guidehouse\u2019s past performance was superior to BDO\u2019s past performance.  Specifically, the contracting officer explained that \u201cBDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse,\u201d and Guidehouse demonstrated a \u201cstrong institutional knowledge of CISA\u2019s Internal Controls program.\u201d  Id.  at 9. \n In challenging the evaluation of the awardee\u2019s past performance references, the protester first argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated the relevance of each of BDO\u2019s past performance references and that the awardee should have at best, received  Page 10 B-423156.2  an overall rating of \u201cneutral.\u201d5  Comments at 6.  In support of its contention, the protester \nasserts that the awardee\u2019s first reference should not have been evaluated as relevant in \nterms of scope because, by the agency\u2019s own account, BDO did not demonstrate relevant work for a majority  of the sub- tasks under tasks two and five.  Id. at 3-5.  The \nprotester also argues that BDO\u2019s third reference should not have been considered because it was noncompliant with the RFQ\u2019s instructions --the reference consisted of \ntwo separate task orders and, thus, exceeded the maximum limit of submittable past performance references.  Id. at 5-6.   \n The agency responds that its evaluation of BDO\u2019s past performance was reasonable, referencing multiple ways in which the contemporaneous evaluation record shows that BDO\u2019s references exhibited work relevant to the five measured tasks, and argues that the protester\u2019s assertions amount to disagreement with its conclusions.  Agency Supp. Briefing at 4- 7.  The agency further contends that it reasonably considered the totality of \npast performance information when assessing risk, as opposed to requiring each reference to independently demonstrate experience with all five SOW tasks.  For \nexample, the agency similarly found Guidehouse\u2019s second reference relevant even though it did not reflect experience relevant to task 5 and only demonstrated relevant experience wi th some subtasks under tasks 1 and 2.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective \nAction Past Performance Report, at 7- 8.  The agency also argues that it found the \nawardee\u2019s third past performance reference compliant with the terms of the RFQ and reasonably considered the reference during the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  \nAgency Supp. Briefing at  9-11. \n \nWe find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation of BDO\u2019s first past performance \nreference.  In accordance with the RFQ, the agency considered the reference\u2019s \nrelevance in terms of the size and number of FTEs employed, and the scope of the \ntasks and subtasks required under the RFQ .  Regarding the scope analysis, the agency \nfound the reference reflected work that was relevant to four of the five measured tasks.  \nAR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 4.  More specifically , the \nagency ack nowledged the reference\u2019s lack of relevance to certain aspects of tasks 2  \nand 5, but overall assessed the reference to be relevant in size and scope.  Id.  at 10- 11; \nSee PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ; IBM U.S. Federal , B-409885 et al. , Sept. 5, 2014, \n2014 CPD \u00b6  289 at 10 (agency reasonably considered identified contracts similar in \neither size, scope, or complexity, and the solicitation did not require that each past performance reference meet all of the relevance criteria in order to be considered).  On \n \n5 The protester, in addition to its arguments regarding the awardee\u2019s first and third \nreferences, argues that the agency improperly considered BDO\u2019s second reference.  As noted above, however, the past performance report and award decision document make clear that the agency did not consider BDO\u2019s second reference to be relevant in size and did not consider the reference in its evaluation.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 13, \nCorrective Action Past Performance Report, at 10 (\u201cReference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 had too few FTE\u2019s to be considered relevant in size.\u201d).  Because this argument is based on a factual inaccuracy inconsistent with the contemporaneous evaluation record, we do not address it further.    Page 11 B-423156.2  this record, the agency reasonably considered the relevance of the reference, \nconcluding that it demonstrated a substantially similar scope to warrant a rating of relevant.  The protester\u2019s argument that the reference should not be considered relevant because of the agency\u2019s findings regarding tasks 2  and 5 is no more than disagreement \nwith the agency\u2019s judgment.  \n The protester  argues that BDO submitted more than three past performance references, \nin contravention of the RFQ.  Specifically, Guidehouse argues that BDO\u2019s  third past \nperformance reference consists of two separate past performance references , which, \nwhen counted with the other two past performance references,  exceeded the three \nreference limit set forth in the RFQ .  Supp. Briefing at 4.  To support its argument, the \nprotester notes that the third reference consist s of two separate task orders  placed \nunder  an indefinite- delivery indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract with each separate order \ninvolv ing different scopes of wor k, periods of performance, and numbers of FTEs.  Id.  \nat 5.  We are not persuaded by the protester\u2019s argument .  Nothing in the RFQ \nestablishes that a single reference for an IDIQ contract would be evaluated with respect to individual orders placed under the IDIQ contract.  Absent such a provision, the record reflects the agency reasonably concluded that the second order was a logical \u201cfollow -\non\u201d effort for the same scope of the work performed under the first order, and thus reflected a singular effort across the period of both orders.   AR, Tab 13, Corrective \nAction Past Performance Report, at 10- 11.  Because the terms of the RFQ did not \nrequire the agency to classify the protester\u2019s third reference as two separate references , \nthis protest ground is denied.\n6 \n The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative \ndifferences between the protester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s past performance records.  Supp. \nBriefing at 8.  In this regard, the protester argues that it should have received a higher rating than the awardee because the protester\u2019s references were more relevant, showed DHS -specific experience as a prime contractor, and were for a larger dollar \nvalue which required more FTEs to perform.  Id.  at 8-9.  \n \n \n6 Even assuming for the sake of argument that the agency should only have considered \none of the two related, sequential orders, we cannot discern any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice where either order, standing alone, would arguably be relev ant \nin terms of the size and number of FTEs employed as compared to the requirements of this procurement.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evidence, we will not sustain a protest, ev en \nwhere a protester may have shown that an agency\u2019s actions were arguably improper.  Interfor US, Inc. , B-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD \u00b6 19 at 7.  Here, the number of \nFTEs and the size of the effort, when adjusting for the different periods of performance of this requirement and the challenged reference, would be comparable to this requirement for either of the orders at issue.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past \nPerformance Report, at 8.  Thus, on this record, we can discern no reasonable possibility of prejudice even if we were to accept the protester\u2019s argument, and therefore, find no basis on which to sustain the protest.   Page 12 B-423156.2  We find Guidehouse\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s evaluation of its past performance \nwas unreasonable to be unsupported by the record.  As noted above, the agency established \u201clow risk\u201d as the highest rating for past performance.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. N o. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 11- 12.  Where, as here, a protester \ncomplains that its quotation should have been assigned a higher rating than the highest rating available under the terms of the RFQ, its fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See, e.g. , Hendall, Inc. , B-417513.3, B-417513.4, Feb. 24, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 87 \nat 9-10 (where a solicitation defines the highest possible past performance rating and \nthe protester receives that rating, the protester \u2019s assertion that it should have received \ngreater credit than the solicitation contemplated fails to state a valid basis of \nprotest);   22nd Century Techs., Inc. --Recon. , B-416669.7, Nov. 14, 2019, 2019 CPD \n\u00b6 385 at 4 (same) .  Beyond its disagreement as to the adjectival ratings assigned to the \nquotations , the protester\u2019s argument also ignores the contemporaneous record, which \nreflects that the BEC and contracting officer expressly recognized Guidehouse\u2019s superior past performance.  As noted, the contracting officer\u2019s award decision expressly recognized that \u201cBDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse.\u201d  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Thus, the protester\u2019s argument that the agency failed to consider qualitative differences between the vendors\u2019 past performance selectively ignores the contemporaneous record.  \n In sum, we find the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation of both vendors to be both well-reasoned and thoroughly documented.  Accordingly, we find no reason to question \nthe agency\u2019s evaluation judgments as to the relevance and quality of either  vendor \u2019s \npast performance.  See D&G Support Services, LLC, supra at 9 (an agency \u2019s evaluation \nof past performance is, by its nature, subjective, and that evaluation, including the agency \u2019s assessments of relevance, scope, and significance, are matters of discretion \nthat we will not disturb absent a clear demonstration that the assessments are \nunreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria); see also FN Mfg., LLC, supra \nat 7 (a protester's disagreement with the agency \u2019s judgment , without more,  does not \nestablish that an evaluation was unreasonable).  \n Best-Value Determination  \n The protester also contends that the agency conducted a flawed best -value \ndetermination because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable underlying past performance evaluation.  The protester also contends that a reasonable tradeoff would have considered Guidehouse\u2019s superior past performance worth the associated price \npremium in light of the solicitation\u2019s evaluation scheme where the non- price factors were \nmore important than price.  Supp. Briefing at 10.  We find no basis on which to sustain the protest .   \n Source selection officials in best -value procurements have broad discretion in making \nprice\/technical tradeoffs, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governed only by the tests of rationality and consistency with the solicitation\u2019 s \nevaluation criteria.

An agency may properly select a lower -rated, lower -priced \nquotation or proposal where it reasonably concludes that the price premium involved in \nselecting a higher -rated quotation or proposal is not justified in light of the acceptabl e \nlevel of technical competence available at a lower price, even where price is the least important factor.

Specifically, the tradeoff expressly recognized that Guidehouse dem onstrated strong institutional knowledge, presented less transition risk \nas the incumbent, and had more in- depth past performance than BDO.  AR, Tab 14, \nCorrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Ultimately, however, the contracting officer did not believe t he protester\u2019s evaluated advantages warranted a $3.1 million (or more than \n26 percent) price premium because the risk of stoppage or complete failure during transition was low, and the agency had no concerns about whether BDO had the experience necessary t o provide quality work.  Id.  In short, the record disproves the \nprotester\u2019s assertation that the agency did not look behind the adjectival ratings and credit Guidehouse for its superior past performance.  The protester\u2019s disagreement with the source selec tion official\u2019s subjective business judgment as to the competing merits \nof the quotations and ultimate price\/technical tradeoff, without more, does not render the tradeoff decision unreasonable.

Protest challenging the evaluation of the protester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s past performance is denied where the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms \nof the solicitation.  \n 2.  Protest that the agency performed a flawed best -value determination is denied \nwhere the agency\u2019s tradeoff was  reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation.  \nDECISION  \n Guidehouse Inc., of McLean, Virginia, protests the issuance of an order to BDO Public Sector, LLC, (BDO) of McLean, Virginia, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 70RCSJ24Q00000072, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, \nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA), for internal control assessment and \nremediation management support services.  The protester contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s quotations was unreasonable, and resulted in a flawed best -value decision.  \n We deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423156.2  BACKGROUND  \n \nOn July 19, 2024, the agency issued the RFQ for the placement of an order under the General Services Administration Multiple Award Schedule, Special Item Number 541219 (Budget and Financial Management Services), for internal control support services for th e CISA Office of Chief Financial Officer Internal Control Subdivision.  \nAgency Report (AR), Tab 3.a, Statement of Work (SOW) at 1- 2.  The RFQ, which the \nagency amended once, contemplated issuance of a hybrid fixed- price\/time -and-\nmaterials task order with an anticipated task order term of one base year, and two, 1-year options.  Id.  at 2; Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement at 2.  \n The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis \nconsidering price and three non- price factors (which are listed in descending order of \nimportance):  management and staffing approach; past performance; and price.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 9- 10.  When the non- price \nevaluation factors were combined, they were more important than the price factor.  Id.  \nat 10.  The RFQ, however, further advised vendors that the agency would not issue an \naward to a vendor  \u201cwho presents a considerably higher overall price to achieve only \nslightly better performance capabilities.  Consequently, as non- price evaluations \nbecome more equal, price may be of greater significance in the trade- off consideration.\u201d  \nId.  Only the past performance factor is relevant to the issues presented in this protest.  \n As to past performance, vendors were to provide up to three past performance references that demonstrated at least two years of experience performing the type of work described in the statement of work (SOW).  Id. at 8.  The past performance \nreferences needed to include work similar in nature to the requirement and be drawn from work ongoing or completed within the previous five years from the date of RFQ release.   Id. \n For the past performance factor, the agency would evaluate the relevance of past performance and how well the vendor performed.  Id. at 10.  The agency would consider \npast performance relevant if it was like the solicitation\u2019s requirement in both size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).  Id.  The more relevant the past performance, the stronger predictor of future \nsuccess and, thus, more influence on the past performance risk assessment.  Id.  The \nagency would provide one rating under this factor according to the following scale:    Page 3 B-423156.2  Confidence \nLevel Rating  Definition  \nLow Risk  The Quoter\u2019s record of past performance indicates there is very little \nrisk associated with receiving timely services of the highest quality. \nThe Quoter\u2019s past performance shows a pattern of consistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter will likely meet or possibly \nexceed the requirements of the task order.  \nMedium Risk  The Quoter\u2019s record of past performance indicates that there is \nsome potential risk associated with receiving timely services of the \nhighest quality. The Quoter\u2019s past performance reflects instances of inconsistency in successful performance of quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating the Quoter may not meet the \nrequirements of the task order.  \nHigh Risk  The Quoter\u2019s record of past performance shows a pattern of poor \npast performance, including quality, schedule, cost control and management, indicating a high likelihood that the Quoter will \nconsistently fail to meet the requirements of the task order.  \nNeutral  Quoter has no relevant or recent past performance, or there is no \nrecord of past performance of Quoter available for evaluation.  \n Id. at 11- 12.  \n The agency received six quotations, including one from the protester and BDO.  See AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 4.  On October 25, 2024, following \nevaluations, the agency notified the protester that it had issued the subject order to \nBDO.  AR, Tab 8, Notice of Award.  In response to Guidehouse\u2019s request for a brief explanation, the agency disclosed the following evaluation results for BDO and \nGuidehouse:  \n \nContractor  Factor 1 \n(Management & \nStaffing \nApproach)  Factor 2 (Past \nPerformance)  Factor 3 \n(Price)  Quoted Price  \nBDO  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $10,196,570.06  \nGuidehouse  High Confidence  Low Risk  Reasonable  $13,345,430.25  \n AR, Tab 9, Brief Explanation, at 1.  \n On November 4, Guidehouse filed a protest with our Office, which we docketed as B-423156.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. at 2.  On November 27, the \nagency filed a request to dismiss the protest as academic based on the agency\u2019s \nproposed corrective action to reevaluate quotations and conduct a new best -value \ndetermination.  AR, Tab 10, Notice of Corrective Action & Req. to Dismiss.  We \nsubsequently dismissed the protest as academic .  See Guidehouse, Inc. , B-423156 \n(Dec. 3, 2024) (unpublished decision).   Page 4 B-423156.2   \nAs part of the corrective action, both the technical evaluation team (TET) and business evaluation committee (BEC) met to reevaluate Guidehouse\u2019s and BDO\u2019s quotations under the non- price evaluation factors.   The TET completed its reevaluation and issued \nan updated technical evaluation report for the management and staffing approach; the ratings for this factor did not change.  AR, Tab 12, Corrective Action Tech. Eval. Rep. \nat 2. \n As to past performance, the BEC confirmed the prior low risk ratings assigned to both vendors, but also provided a detailed analysis of the recency, relevance, and quality for each past performance reference for each vendor.  In terms of relevance, the BEC  first \nconsidered the dollar value of the reference, the percentage of work completed by the performing entity (either the prime vendor itself or one of its proposed subcontractors), as well as the number of full -time equivalents employed by the performing entity.  See, \ne.g., AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Perf. Eval. Rep. at 5.  Based on this initial \nrelevance analysis, the BEC determined that two of BDO\u2019s past performance references, one for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant, and all three of Guidehouse\u2019s references, two for itself and one for a proposed subcontractor, were relevant.  See id.  at 10- 11, 28.  \n For each relevant reference, the BEC next considered the percentage of tasks performed under the past performance reference as compared to the tasks required by the SOW for the instant requirement.  A summary of the BEC\u2019s analysis is as follows:  \n \nSOW Task  Relevance  \nRelevant  Not Relevant  \nBDO Reference #1  \nTask 1  X (76% of tasks)   \nTask 2  X (44% of tasks)   \nTask 3  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 4  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 5   X (0% of tasks)  \nBDO Reference #3 (for subcontractor)  \nTask 1  X (70%)   \nTask 2  X (33%)   \nTask 3  X (100%)   \nTask 4  X (100%)   \nTask 5  X (75%)   \n Id. at 4-5, 8-10. \n  Page 5 B-423156.2  SOW Task  Relevance  \nRelevant  Not Relevant  \nGuidehouse Reference #1  \nTask 1  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 2  X (88% of tasks)   \nTask 3  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 4  X (100% of tasks)   \nTask 5  X (100% of tasks)   \nGuidehouse Reference #2  \nTask 1  X (82%)   \nTask 2  X (55%)   \nTask 3  X (100%)   \nTask 4  X (100%)   \nTask 5   X (0%)  \nGuidehouse Reference #3 (for subcontractor)  \nTask 1  X (94%)   \nTask 2  X (44%)   \nTask 3  X (100%)   \nTask 4  X (100%)   \nTask 5  X (75%)   \n \nId. at 23- 28. \n In assigning BDO an overall low risk rating, the BEC recognized that, between both of its references, BDO demonstrated relevant experience with the type of work required by \nthe SOW, \u201cthough relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 [were] on the lighter side as a \nwhole.\u201d  Id. at 10.  The BEC, however, explained that the lack of relevant experience \nwith some subtasks, while noted, did \u201cnot present a genuine concern about ability to perform them,\u201d and that both BDO and its subcontractor had both demonstrated their ability to lead performance related to at least tasks 1 through 4, and BDO\u2019s proposed \nsubcontractor had relevant experience performing task 5.  Id. at 10 -11. \n The source selection official\u2019s subsequent award decision reaffirmed the award to BDO.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 10.  The contracting officer, who was the source selection official, expressly agreed with the BEC\u2019s past performance evaluation findings.  Id.  at 3.  In his tradeoff analysis, the contracting officer \nexpressly recognized that Guidehouse, the incumbent, had more relevant past performance and other non- price advantages based on its incumbency, but those \nbenefits were not worth a $3.1 million (or 23.6 percent) price premium.  Specifically, the \ncontracting officer explained that:  \n While Guidehouse Inc. does show both strong institutional knowledge of CISA\u2019s Internal Controls program (and is the incumbent, automatically presenting less transition risk) and provided more references of performing similar work as a prime contractor, I do not believe this is worth an extra $3.1 [million].  The CISA Internal Controls program has matured, and the  Page 6 B-423156.2  risk of stoppage or complete failure due to transitioning to a new team is \nminimal.  While BDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse, their experience was enough to garner a Low Risk rating and the Government has no concerns that BDO has the \nexperience to provide quality work.  Therefore, Guidehouse Inc.\u2019s solution is not worth the 23.60 [percent] price premium compared to BDO Public Sector LLC\u2019s Quote.  \n AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.    \n On February 10, 2025, the agency notified Guidehouse that it had confirmed award to BDO.  AR, Tab 15, Second Notice of Award, at 1.  On February 10, the agency provided the protester a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 16, Brief Explanation to Guidehouse at 1.  This protest followed.    DISCUSSION  Guidehouse raises two primary protest grounds.\n1  First, the protester challenges the \nreasonableness of the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  Comments at  2.  \nSecond, the protester argues that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff is flawed, contending \nthat the agency unreasonably found the awardee to be low risk under the past \nperformance factor and that the agency unreasonably elevated the importance of price in making its selection decision.  Id.  at 9.  We find no basis to sustain the protest.  \n Past Performance Evaluation  \n Guidehouse argues that the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation of both the awardee\u2019s and protester\u2019s past performance references was unreasonable.\n2  Regarding \n \n1 Guidehouse also initially alleged that (i) the agency misevaluated its proposal under \nthe staffing and management approach factor, and (ii) BDO should have received a lower past performance rating based on alleged adverse performance about BDO\u2019s corporate parent, but the protester subsequently withdrew those allegations.  See \nComments at 1 n.1.  \n2 The protester raises other collateral arguments.  While this decision does not \nspecifically address all of the protester\u2019s arguments, we find that none provides a basis on which to sustain the protest.  As one example, the protester argues that the agency , \nin assigning the awardee a low risk past performance rating, ignored BDO\u2019s lack of past performance references involving work for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which Guidehouse argues was required by the RFQ.  Comments at 7.  We find no meri t \nto this argument.  First, the relevant past performance evaluation criteria did not specifically limit relevance only to prior work performed for DHS.  In this regard, the RFQ only required offerors to demonstrate past performance that included work \u201csim ilar \nin nature to this requirement.\u201d  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  As discussed herein, the agency reasonably evaluated past \n(continued...)   Page 7 B-423156.2  the awardee\u2019s quotation, the protester asserts that the agency unreasonably evaluated \nthe relevance of BDO\u2019s past performance references and the agency overlooked the risks of BDO\u2019s allegedly limited past performance record.  Comments at 2- 9.  The \nprotester also contends that the agency\u2019s evaluation of the protester\u2019s quotation was unreasonable because the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative differences between itself and the awardee\u2019s past performance.  Id.  at 9-11.  The agency maintains \nthat its past performance evaluation of both quotations was reasonable and in accordance with the terms of the RFQ, and that the protester\u2019s allegations reflect nothing more than Guidehouse\u2019s disagreement with the agency\u2019s e valuation.  \nMemorandum of Law at 3.  As addressed below, we find no basis on which to sustain the protest.  \n When a protester challenges an agency \u2019s past performance evaluation, we will review \nthe evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation\u2019 s \nevaluation criteria, and procurement statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agency \u2019s rationale is adequately documented.  D&G Support Services, LLC , B-419245, \nB-419245.3, Jan. 6, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b615 at 8.  An agency \u2019s evaluation of past \nperformance, including its consideration of the relevance, scope, and significance of a vendor \u2019s performance history, is a matter of discretion, which we will not disturb unless \nthe agency \u2019s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria.  \nSee Sterling Medical Associates, Inc. , B-418674, B-418674.2, July 23, 2020, 2020 CPD \n\u00b6 255 at 8.  A protester \u2019s disagreement with the agency \u2019s judgment , without more,  does \nnot establish that an evaluation was unreasonable.  FN Mfg., LLC , B-402059.4, \nB-402059.5, Mar. 22, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6104 at 7.  \n \n \nperformance references for relevance considering size, scope, and complexity as compared to the requirements of the SOW.  \nSecond, we also find no basis for the protester\u2019s intimation that the SOW imposed additional past performance relevance requirements beyond the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria.  Specifically, the protester argues that the agency was required to evaluate specific demonstrated knowledge with each of the multitude of federal laws \nand policies enumerated in the SOW, most namely the DHS Financial Accountability Act (DHS FAA).  In support of this position, the protester highlights the section of the \nSOW, which explained that the contractor must possess a comprehensive and working knowledge of federal laws and policies with respect to internal controls, including the \nDHS FAA.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. 1, Updated SOW, at 1- 2.  We do not agree.  \nRather, the agency reasonably considered relevance on the basis of a vendor\u2019s demonstrated experience with federal internal control laws and policies generally, absent a specific solici tation requirement for vendors to demonstrate specific \nexperience with each enumerated law or policy.  Additionally, we note that the agency specifically credited Guidehouse in the tradeoff with its \u201cstrong institutional knowledge of CISA\u2019s Internal Contro ls program\u201d and depth of experience garnered as the incumbent.  \nAR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  \n   Page 8 B-423156.2  The RFQ instructed vendors to submit up to three past performance references \u201cdrawn \nfrom work ongoing or completed within the previous five (5) years from the date of solicitation release.\u201d  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 8.  The RFQ required the references to include work similar in nature to the requirement.  Id.  Past performance would be considered relevant if it was \u201clike the requirement in \nboth size (dollar value and number of staff supporting the requirement) and scope (work that is like the SOW).\u201d Id.   \n The RFQ explained that the agency would assess each past performance reference to determine the likelihood of the vendor successfully performing the prospective task order.  Id. at 10.  The agency\u2019s assessment would consider whether the past \nperformance reference was relevant as well as the reference\u2019s history of quality, schedule, cost control, and management.  Id.  To evaluate relevance, the BEC \nassessed each past performance reference to determine if it demonstrated performance of five of the eight tasks  required by the RFQ.\n3  Id.  In addition to the information \nprovided, the agency\u2019s evaluation would also consider information provided through \nelectronic government databases including, but not limited to, the Contractor \nPerformance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).4  Id.  The agency would then \ndetermine the level of risk for a vendor\u2019s potential performance based on the vendor\u2019s \noverall relevant past performance.  Id.  \n As discussed above, BDO submitted three past performance references in its quotation, two of which the agency found to be recent and relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13, Past Performance Report at 10.  The BEC, after reviewing the quality information available for these two recent and relevant references, ultimately concluded that BDO\u2019s \npast performance presented low risk to the government.  Specifically, the BEC determined that:  \n \nThe past performance references were all found to be recent. Reference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 \nhad too few FTE\u2019s [full -time equivalents] to be considered relevant in size.  \nBetween all references, relevance in scope to CISA\u2019s requirement was \n \n3 The SOW includes eight tasks:  (1) internal control assessment, corrective action \nplanning, and remediation support; (2) data analytics and automation technical support; (3) technical support; (4) project management; (5) audit liaison (optional); (6) surge internal control assessments and remediation special projections (optional); (7) software licenses; and (8) travel.  AR, Tab 4.c, RFQ, amend. No. 1, Updated SOW, at 2 -8.  \nBecause task six was identical in scope to tasks one and four, and tasks seven and eight were not to be evaluated under the past performance factor, only the first five tasks were assessed for relevance.  AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past Performance Report, at 4 n.1.  \n4 The CPARS evaluation consisted of six evaluative areas:  quality; schedule; cost \ncontrol; management; small business subcontracting; regulatory compliance; and other: product\/service delivery.  Id. at 6; Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.1503(b)(2).   Page 9 B-423156.2  demonstrated, though relevance to Task 2 and Task 5 are on the lighter \nside as a whole. The lacking relevance in some sub -tasks is noted, but \ndoes not present a genuine concern about ability to perform them as written in the SOW.  The quality of each refence was found to be positive, \nwith each rated factor being given a \u201cVery Good\u201d or \u201cExceptional\u201d rating.  . . .  Of the two references relevant in size, one was led by BDO as \nthe prime and one was led by their proposed subcontractor  [ ] as the \nprime.   While [BDO\u2019s subcontractor]  is the only reference that showed \nperformance related to Task 5, both BDO and [BDO\u2019s subcontractor]  \ndemonstrated leading performance related to tasks 1 \u2013  4.  Due to all \nfactors discussed above, we have rated BDO PUBLIC SECTOR, LLC as LOW RISK for this past performance evaluation.  \n Id. at 10- 11.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the BEC\u2019s past \nperformance evaluation.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision Document at 3.  \n Guidehouse also submitted three past performance references, all three of which the agency found to be relevant in scope and size.  AR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 28.  With respect to Guidehouse\u2019s past performance references, the evaluators found the following:  \n \nThe past performance references were found to be recent, relevant in size, and relevant in scope to CISA\u2019s requirement though relevance to \nTask 5 is on the lighter side as a whole.  The lacking relevance in some \nsub-tasks is noted, but does not present a genuine concern about ability to \nperform them as written in the SOW.  Guidehouse led all work as prime in \nthe submitted references.  The quality of each refence was found to be \npositive, with each rated factor being given an \u201cExceptional\u201d rating. \nTherefore,  we have rated GUIDEHOUSE LLP as  LOW RISK for  this past \nperformance evaluation.  \n Id.  Based on its review, the agency assigned an overall past performance risk rating of \n\u201clow risk\u201d for Guidehouse.  Id.  The contracting officer expressly concurred with the \nBEC\u2019s evaluation of Guidehouse\u2019s past performance.  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action \nAward Decision Document at 3.   \n The contracting officer in conducting his tradeoff analysis also expressly recognized that Guidehouse\u2019s past performance was superior to BDO\u2019s past performance.  Specifically, the contracting officer explained that \u201cBDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse,\u201d and Guidehouse demonstrated a \u201cstrong institutional knowledge of CISA\u2019s Internal Controls program.\u201d  Id.  at 9. \n In challenging the evaluation of the awardee\u2019s past performance references, the protester first argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated the relevance of each of BDO\u2019s past performance references and that the awardee should have at best, received  Page 10 B-423156.2  an overall rating of \u201cneutral.\u201d5  Comments at 6.  In support of its contention, the protester \nasserts that the awardee\u2019s first reference should not have been evaluated as relevant in \nterms of scope because, by the agency\u2019s own account, BDO did not demonstrate relevant work for a majority  of the sub- tasks under tasks two and five.  Id. at 3-5.  The \nprotester also argues that BDO\u2019s third reference should not have been considered because it was noncompliant with the RFQ\u2019s instructions --the reference consisted of \ntwo separate task orders and, thus, exceeded the maximum limit of submittable past performance references.  Id. at 5-6.   \n The agency responds that its evaluation of BDO\u2019s past performance was reasonable, referencing multiple ways in which the contemporaneous evaluation record shows that BDO\u2019s references exhibited work relevant to the five measured tasks, and argues that the protester\u2019s assertions amount to disagreement with its conclusions.  Agency Supp. Briefing at 4- 7.  The agency further contends that it reasonably considered the totality of \npast performance information when assessing risk, as opposed to requiring each reference to independently demonstrate experience with all five SOW tasks.  For \nexample, the agency similarly found Guidehouse\u2019s second reference relevant even though it did not reflect experience relevant to task 5 and only demonstrated relevant experience wi th some subtasks under tasks 1 and 2.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective \nAction Past Performance Report, at 7- 8.  The agency also argues that it found the \nawardee\u2019s third past performance reference compliant with the terms of the RFQ and reasonably considered the reference during the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation.  \nAgency Supp. Briefing at  9-11. \n \nWe find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation of BDO\u2019s first past performance \nreference.  In accordance with the RFQ, the agency considered the reference\u2019s \nrelevance in terms of the size and number of FTEs employed, and the scope of the \ntasks and subtasks required under the RFQ .  Regarding the scope analysis, the agency \nfound the reference reflected work that was relevant to four of the five measured tasks.  \nAR, Tab 13 Corrective Action Past Performance Report at 4.  More specifically , the \nagency ack nowledged the reference\u2019s lack of relevance to certain aspects of tasks 2  \nand 5, but overall assessed the reference to be relevant in size and scope.  Id.  at 10- 11; \nSee PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ; IBM U.S. Federal , B-409885 et al. , Sept. 5, 2014, \n2014 CPD \u00b6  289 at 10 (agency reasonably considered identified contracts similar in \neither size, scope, or complexity, and the solicitation did not require that each past performance reference meet all of the relevance criteria in order to be considered).  On \n \n5 The protester, in addition to its arguments regarding the awardee\u2019s first and third \nreferences, argues that the agency improperly considered BDO\u2019s second reference.  As noted above, however, the past performance report and award decision document make clear that the agency did not consider BDO\u2019s second reference to be relevant in size and did not consider the reference in its evaluation.  See, e.g. , AR, Tab 13, \nCorrective Action Past Performance Report, at 10 (\u201cReference [No.] 1 and [No.] 3 were found to be relevant in size, but reference [No.] 2 had too few FTE\u2019s to be considered relevant in size.\u201d).  Because this argument is based on a factual inaccuracy inconsistent with the contemporaneous evaluation record, we do not address it further.    Page 11 B-423156.2  this record, the agency reasonably considered the relevance of the reference, \nconcluding that it demonstrated a substantially similar scope to warrant a rating of relevant.  The protester\u2019s argument that the reference should not be considered relevant because of the agency\u2019s findings regarding tasks 2  and 5 is no more than disagreement \nwith the agency\u2019s judgment.  \n The protester  argues that BDO submitted more than three past performance references, \nin contravention of the RFQ.  Specifically, Guidehouse argues that BDO\u2019s  third past \nperformance reference consists of two separate past performance references , which, \nwhen counted with the other two past performance references,  exceeded the three \nreference limit set forth in the RFQ .  Supp. Briefing at 4.  To support its argument, the \nprotester notes that the third reference consist s of two separate task orders  placed \nunder  an indefinite- delivery indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contract with each separate order \ninvolv ing different scopes of wor k, periods of performance, and numbers of FTEs.  Id.  \nat 5.  We are not persuaded by the protester\u2019s argument .  Nothing in the RFQ \nestablishes that a single reference for an IDIQ contract would be evaluated with respect to individual orders placed under the IDIQ contract.  Absent such a provision, the record reflects the agency reasonably concluded that the second order was a logical \u201cfollow -\non\u201d effort for the same scope of the work performed under the first order, and thus reflected a singular effort across the period of both orders.   AR, Tab 13, Corrective \nAction Past Performance Report, at 10- 11.  Because the terms of the RFQ did not \nrequire the agency to classify the protester\u2019s third reference as two separate references , \nthis protest ground is denied.\n6 \n The protester also argues that the agency failed to properly consider the qualitative \ndifferences between the protester\u2019s and awardee\u2019s past performance records.  Supp. \nBriefing at 8.  In this regard, the protester argues that it should have received a higher rating than the awardee because the protester\u2019s references were more relevant, showed DHS -specific experience as a prime contractor, and were for a larger dollar \nvalue which required more FTEs to perform.  Id.  at 8-9.  \n \n \n6 Even assuming for the sake of argument that the agency should only have considered \none of the two related, sequential orders, we cannot discern any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice where either order, standing alone, would arguably be relev ant \nin terms of the size and number of FTEs employed as compared to the requirements of this procurement.  Competitive prejudice is an essential element of any viable protest, and where none is shown or otherwise evidence, we will not sustain a protest, ev en \nwhere a protester may have shown that an agency\u2019s actions were arguably improper.  Interfor US, Inc. , B-410622, Dec. 30, 2014, 2015 CPD \u00b6 19 at 7.  Here, the number of \nFTEs and the size of the effort, when adjusting for the different periods of performance of this requirement and the challenged reference, would be comparable to this requirement for either of the orders at issue.  See AR, Tab 13, Corrective Action Past \nPerformance Report, at 8.  Thus, on this record, we can discern no reasonable possibility of prejudice even if we were to accept the protester\u2019s argument, and therefore, find no basis on which to sustain the protest.   Page 12 B-423156.2  We find Guidehouse\u2019s assertion that the agency\u2019s evaluation of its past performance \nwas unreasonable to be unsupported by the record.  As noted above, the agency established \u201clow risk\u201d as the highest rating for past performance.  AR, Tab 4.h, RFQ, amend. N o. 1, Updated RFQ Provisions, at 11- 12.  Where, as here, a protester \ncomplains that its quotation should have been assigned a higher rating than the highest rating available under the terms of the RFQ, its fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See, e.g. , Hendall, Inc. , B-417513.3, B-417513.4, Feb. 24, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 87 \nat 9-10 (where a solicitation defines the highest possible past performance rating and \nthe protester receives that rating, the protester \u2019s assertion that it should have received \ngreater credit than the solicitation contemplated fails to state a valid basis of \nprotest);   22nd Century Techs., Inc. --Recon. , B-416669.7, Nov. 14, 2019, 2019 CPD \n\u00b6 385 at 4 (same) .  Beyond its disagreement as to the adjectival ratings assigned to the \nquotations , the protester\u2019s argument also ignores the contemporaneous record, which \nreflects that the BEC and contracting officer expressly recognized Guidehouse\u2019s superior past performance.  As noted, the contracting officer\u2019s award decision expressly recognized that \u201cBDO does not have the same depth of experience with this requirement as Guidehouse.\u201d  AR, Tab 14, Corrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Thus, the protester\u2019s argument that the agency failed to consider qualitative differences between the vendors\u2019 past performance selectively ignores the contemporaneous record.  \n In sum, we find the agency\u2019s past performance evaluation of both vendors to be both well-reasoned and thoroughly documented.  Accordingly, we find no reason to question \nthe agency\u2019s evaluation judgments as to the relevance and quality of either  vendor \u2019s \npast performance.  See D&G Support Services, LLC, supra at 9 (an agency \u2019s evaluation \nof past performance is, by its nature, subjective, and that evaluation, including the agency \u2019s assessments of relevance, scope, and significance, are matters of discretion \nthat we will not disturb absent a clear demonstration that the assessments are \nunreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria); see also FN Mfg., LLC, supra \nat 7 (a protester's disagreement with the agency \u2019s judgment , without more,  does not \nestablish that an evaluation was unreasonable).  \n Best-Value Determination  \n The protester also contends that the agency conducted a flawed best -value \ndetermination because it was based on the allegedly unreasonable underlying past performance evaluation.  The protester also contends that a reasonable tradeoff would have considered Guidehouse\u2019s superior past performance worth the associated price \npremium in light of the solicitation\u2019s evaluation scheme where the non- price factors were \nmore important than price.  Supp. Briefing at 10.  We find no basis on which to sustain the protest .   \n Source selection officials in best -value procurements have broad discretion in making \nprice\/technical tradeoffs, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governed only by the tests of rationality and consistency with the solicitation\u2019 s \nevaluation criteria.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, B -422823.2, Nov. 18, 2024,  Page 13 B-423156.2  2024 CPD \u00b6 272 at 8.  An agency may properly select a lower -rated, lower -priced \nquotation or proposal where it reasonably concludes that the price premium involved in \nselecting a higher -rated quotation or proposal is not justified in light of the acceptabl e \nlevel of technical competence available at a lower price, even where price is the least important factor.  Id.; Angel Menedez Envt\u2019l Servs., Inc., B -310340.2, Apr. 11, 2008, \n2008 CPD \u00b6 73 at 3 n.1.  \n As addressed above, the agency reasonably evaluated the vendors\u2019 past performance, and the contracting officer expressly considered the unique strengths offered by Guidehouse\u2019s quotation.  Specifically, the tradeoff expressly recognized that Guidehouse dem onstrated strong institutional knowledge, presented less transition risk \nas the incumbent, and had more in- depth past performance than BDO.  AR, Tab 14, \nCorrective Action Award Decision, at 9.  Ultimately, however, the contracting officer did not believe t he protester\u2019s evaluated advantages warranted a $3.1 million (or more than \n26 percent) price premium because the risk of stoppage or complete failure during transition was low, and the agency had no concerns about whether BDO had the experience necessary t o provide quality work.  Id.  In short, the record disproves the \nprotester\u2019s assertation that the agency did not look behind the adjectival ratings and credit Guidehouse for its superior past performance.  The protester\u2019s disagreement with the source selec tion official\u2019s subjective business judgment as to the competing merits \nof the quotations and ultimate price\/technical tradeoff, without more, does not render the tradeoff decision unreasonable.  Preferred Sys. Solutions, B -291750, Feb. 24, 2003, \n2003 CPD \u00b6 56 at 5.  Because the agency\u2019s determination was reasonable, consistent with the RFQ and applicable procurement laws and regulations, we find no basis to sustain the protest.  \n The protest is denied.

        "Summary":"Protest that agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019s proposal is dismissed as \nuntimely where the protester filed the protest more than 10 days after the firm knew or should have known the basis of protest.  \nDECISION  \n Wright Brothers Aero, Inc., a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, protests the award of a contract to Premier Jet Services DAY, LLC, a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, under solicitation No. SPE607 -24-R- 0200, issued by the Defense Logistics Agency for aircr aft \nrefueling at James M . Cox Dayton International Airport  (KDAY)  in Dayton, Ohio.  The \nprotester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019s  proposal and \nfailed to reasonably and properly implement corrective action in response to a prior protest.  \n We dismiss the protest because it is untimely.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on June 13, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, for 723,060 gallons of jet fuel at KDAY.  See  Req. for Dismissal (RFD)  at 2.  The solicitation provided for award on a \nlowest -price, technically acceptable basis.  See  Supp. RFD  at 3.  On February 4, 2025, \nthe agency notified the protester that award had been made to Premier.  Supp. RFD,  \nexh. 4, February  Award Notice at 1.  The notice provided the contract award price and \nreflected that only two offerors --Wright Brothers and Premier --had submitted proposals .  \nId. at 1-2.

Protest, exh. 5, \nDebriefing, B-423326, Feb. 11, 2025.  \n \nWright Brothers filed a protest with our Office on February 11, challenging the agency\u2019s \nevaluation and award decision.  Wright Bros. Aero, Inc., B -423326, Mar. 5, 2025 \n(unpublished decision).  In response, the agency advised our office that it intended to take corrective action by reevaluating proposals , reopening  discussions if necessary, \nand issuing  a new award decision.  Id.  at 1.  As a result of the agency\u2019s proposed \ncorrective action, w e dismissed the protest as academic on March 5.  Id.  at 1-2. \n On April 15, in response to an inquiry from Wright Brothers  regarding the status of the \nprocurement , the contracting officer advised the protester  that the corrective action had \nbeen \u201ccompleted and closed\u201d and that the \u201c KDAY [contract]  has been awarded.\u201d  RFD, \nexh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1.  When Wright Brothers asked whether it would \u201cbe receiving communication on who has won the award,\u201d the contracting officer responded that \u201c[t]he awardee was the same as the original awardee\u201d and that she was unsure if there would be any additional communication until she could \u201c get with Legal.\u201d  Id.  \n On April 28, Wright Brothers emailed the contracting officer, requesting an update and asking:  \u201cIs it possible to get a debrief since there should have been a corrective action?\u201d  RFD, exh. 3, April 28- 29 Emails.  The next day, the contracting officer \nresponded, \u201cI will forward up to Legal.\u201d  Id.   On May 25, having received no further \ninformation from the agency, Wright Brothers filed this protest with our Office.  Protest at 1.  The agency then requested that we dismiss the protest as untimely and for fail ing \nto state a valid basis of protest.  RFD at 1-2. \n DISCUSSION  Wright Brothers\u2019s current protest challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision, as well as the agency\u2019s implementation of the corrective action in response to the firm\u2019s earlier protest.\n1  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to RFD at 2-7.  The agency contends  \nthe protest is untimely and should be dismissed.  We agree.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or  delaying \n \n1 Wright Brothers\u2019s protest also raises allegations that the agency failed to provide a \nproper notice of the corrective action award and failed to provide a debriefing.  These allegations are not subject to review by our Office inasmuch as the adequacy and conduct of a notice of award or debriefing are procedural matters that do not involve the validity of an award.

Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 2012, \n2012 CPD \u00b6 260 at 4.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged \nimproprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis  for protest, whichever is earlier.  \n4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).   An exception to this general rule applies with respect to a protest \nthat challenges \u201ca procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required.\u201d   Id.  In such cases, \nwith respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the protest must be filed no later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.  Id. \n Wright Brothers  maintains that it delayed submitting a protest because the firm was \nwaiting  (1) for the contracting officer to respond to its emails requesting more details \nabout the award,  and (2) a debriefing from the agency .  Resp. to R FD at 1-2.  For the \nreasons discussed below, t hese arguments provide no basis for our Office to consider \nan untimely protest.  \n  More Details  \n The protester alleges  that the agency\u2019s April 15 emails did not include the identity of the \nsuccessful offeror, award amount, or explanation of the basis for award, and that it delayed filing the protest because it was waiting for this information to be provided in a \u201cformal notice\u201d so it would have \u201ca definitive basis to protest.\u201d   Protest at  1-2; Resp. to \nRFD at 2 -7.  The record reflects, however, that Wright Brothers\u2019s challenges to the \nagency\u2019s evaluation and award decision are based on information know n to the \nprotester  as of April 15, when the agency explained that it had reaffirmed  its initial \naward to Premier.  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to R FD at 2-7.   \n As discussed above, the agency provided Wright Brothers with a notice of award on \nFebruary 4.  Supp. RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice.  In that  February  notice, the \nprotester was advised that award had been made to Premier.  Id. at 1.  The notice also \nprovided the contract award price, as well as informing the protester  that only two \nofferors had submitted proposals .  Id. at 1-2.  On April 15, through email \ncorrespondence with the agency , Wright Brothers was advised that the \u201cKDAY \n[contract] has been awarded, \u201d and that \u201c[t]he awardee was the same as the original \nawardee. \u201d  RFD, exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1- 2.  At th at point, through information from \nthe February  4 award notice and the April  15 email s, the protester was aware of  (1) the \nidentity of the successful offeror ; (2) the awarded amount ; and (3) the basis for award \n(\u201cWright Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for \nall line items solicited \u201d).  RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice at 1; RFD, exh. 2, April 15 \nEmails at 1 -2.  Further, because the Air Force had not requested revised proposals, the \nprotester was on notice that  the agency\u2019s reaffirmed award decision was based on the \nsame proposals  and, therefore,  the awarded price remained unchanged from the \nFebruary award notice . \n  Page 4 B-423326.2  We have consistently explained that a disappointed offeror may not delay filing a protest \nuntil the firm is certain that it is in a position to detail all of the possible separate grounds \nof protest.

Moreover , our timeliness rules \ndo not hinge on whether a protester definitively knew of the basis for its protest but rather, as discussed above, require that a protest be filed no later than 10 calendar days \nafter the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2); Magnum Multimedia, B -420227, Nov. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD \n\u00b6 355 at  5.   \n Under the circumstances here, Wright Brothers knew or should have known the basis \nfor its protest by no later than April 15, when the agency notified the protester that it had \ncompleted its corrective action of reevaluating existing proposals and reawarded the contract to Premier.

Tran, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, \nparticipated in the preparation of the decision.  \nDIGEST  \n Protest that agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019s proposal is dismissed as \nuntimely where the protester filed the protest more than 10 days after the firm knew or should have known the basis of protest.  \nDECISION  \n Wright Brothers Aero, Inc., a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, protests the award of a contract to Premier Jet Services DAY, LLC, a small business of Vandalia, Ohio, under solicitation No. SPE607 -24-R- 0200, issued by the Defense Logistics Agency for aircr aft \nrefueling at James M . Cox Dayton International Airport  (KDAY)  in Dayton, Ohio.  The \nprotester contends that the agency unreasonably evaluated the awardee\u2019s  proposal and \nfailed to reasonably and properly implement corrective action in response to a prior protest.  \n We dismiss the protest because it is untimely.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on June 13, 2024, pursuant to the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15, for 723,060 gallons of jet fuel at KDAY.  See  Req. for Dismissal (RFD)  at 2.  The solicitation provided for award on a \nlowest -price, technically acceptable basis.  See  Supp. RFD  at 3.  On February 4, 2025, \nthe agency notified the protester that award had been made to Premier.  Supp. RFD,  \nexh. 4, February  Award Notice at 1.  The notice provided the contract award price and \nreflected that only two offerors --Wright Brothers and Premier --had submitted proposals .  \nId. at 1-2.  The notice also advised the agency\u2019s evaluation determined that \u201c Wright  Page 2 B-423326.2  Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for all line \nitems solicited .\u201d  Id. at 1.  The agency subsequently confirmed in a written  debriefing, \ndated February 6,  that both proposals were  technically  acceptable and award had been \nmade to Premier as the lowest -priced , technically acceptable offeror .  Protest, exh. 5, \nDebriefing, B-423326, Feb. 11, 2025.  \n \nWright Brothers filed a protest with our Office on February 11, challenging the agency\u2019s \nevaluation and award decision.  Wright Bros. Aero, Inc., B -423326, Mar. 5, 2025 \n(unpublished decision).  In response, the agency advised our office that it intended to take corrective action by reevaluating proposals , reopening  discussions if necessary, \nand issuing  a new award decision.  Id.  at 1.  As a result of the agency\u2019s proposed \ncorrective action, w e dismissed the protest as academic on March 5.  Id.  at 1-2. \n On April 15, in response to an inquiry from Wright Brothers  regarding the status of the \nprocurement , the contracting officer advised the protester  that the corrective action had \nbeen \u201ccompleted and closed\u201d and that the \u201c KDAY [contract]  has been awarded.\u201d  RFD, \nexh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1.  When Wright Brothers asked whether it would \u201cbe receiving communication on who has won the award,\u201d the contracting officer responded that \u201c[t]he awardee was the same as the original awardee\u201d and that she was unsure if there would be any additional communication until she could \u201c get with Legal.\u201d  Id.  \n On April 28, Wright Brothers emailed the contracting officer, requesting an update and asking:  \u201cIs it possible to get a debrief since there should have been a corrective action?\u201d  RFD, exh. 3, April 28- 29 Emails.  The next day, the contracting officer \nresponded, \u201cI will forward up to Legal.\u201d  Id.   On May 25, having received no further \ninformation from the agency, Wright Brothers filed this protest with our Office.  Protest at 1.  The agency then requested that we dismiss the protest as untimely and for fail ing \nto state a valid basis of protest.  RFD at 1-2. \n DISCUSSION  Wright Brothers\u2019s current protest challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decision, as well as the agency\u2019s implementation of the corrective action in response to the firm\u2019s earlier protest.\n1  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to RFD at 2-7.  The agency contends  \nthe protest is untimely and should be dismissed.  We agree.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests.  These rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly disrupting or  delaying \n \n1 Wright Brothers\u2019s protest also raises allegations that the agency failed to provide a \nproper notice of the corrective action award and failed to provide a debriefing.  These allegations are not subject to review by our Office inasmuch as the adequacy and conduct of a notice of award or debriefing are procedural matters that do not involve the validity of an award.

Verizon Wireless , B-406854, B -406854.2, Sept. 17, 2012, \n2012 CPD \u00b6 260 at 4.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged \nimproprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis  for protest, whichever is earlier.  \n4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).   An exception to this general rule applies with respect to a protest \nthat challenges \u201ca procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required.\u201d   Id.  In such cases, \nwith respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the protest must be filed no later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.  Id. \n Wright Brothers  maintains that it delayed submitting a protest because the firm was \nwaiting  (1) for the contracting officer to respond to its emails requesting more details \nabout the award,  and (2) a debriefing from the agency .  Resp. to R FD at 1-2.  For the \nreasons discussed below, t hese arguments provide no basis for our Office to consider \nan untimely protest.  \n  More Details  \n The protester alleges  that the agency\u2019s April 15 emails did not include the identity of the \nsuccessful offeror, award amount, or explanation of the basis for award, and that it delayed filing the protest because it was waiting for this information to be provided in a \u201cformal notice\u201d so it would have \u201ca definitive basis to protest.\u201d   Protest at  1-2; Resp. to \nRFD at 2 -7.  The record reflects, however, that Wright Brothers\u2019s challenges to the \nagency\u2019s evaluation and award decision are based on information know n to the \nprotester  as of April 15, when the agency explained that it had reaffirmed  its initial \naward to Premier.  Protest at  1-2; Resp. to R FD at 2-7.   \n As discussed above, the agency provided Wright Brothers with a notice of award on \nFebruary 4.  Supp. RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice.  In that  February  notice, the \nprotester was advised that award had been made to Premier.  Id. at 1.  The notice also \nprovided the contract award price, as well as informing the protester  that only two \nofferors had submitted proposals .  Id. at 1-2.  On April 15, through email \ncorrespondence with the agency , Wright Brothers was advised that the \u201cKDAY \n[contract] has been awarded, \u201d and that \u201c[t]he awardee was the same as the original \nawardee. \u201d  RFD, exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1- 2.  At th at point, through information from \nthe February  4 award notice and the April  15 email s, the protester was aware of  (1) the \nidentity of the successful offeror ; (2) the awarded amount ; and (3) the basis for award \n(\u201cWright Brothers Aero, Inc . did not offer the total lowest price technically acceptable for \nall line items solicited \u201d).  RFD, exh.  4, February Award Notice at 1; RFD, exh. 2, April 15 \nEmails at 1 -2.  Further, because the Air Force had not requested revised proposals, the \nprotester was on notice that  the agency\u2019s reaffirmed award decision was based on the \nsame proposals  and, therefore,  the awarded price remained unchanged from the \nFebruary award notice . \n  Page 4 B-423326.2  We have consistently explained that a disappointed offeror may not delay filing a protest \nuntil the firm is certain that it is in a position to detail all of the possible separate grounds \nof protest.

Peraton \nInc., B-416916.11, Feb. 8, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 88 at 6.  Moreover , our timeliness rules \ndo not hinge on whether a protester definitively knew of the basis for its protest but rather, as discussed above, require that a protest be filed no later than 10 calendar days \nafter the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2); Magnum Multimedia, B -420227, Nov. 2, 2021, 2021 CPD \n\u00b6 355 at  5.   \n Under the circumstances here, Wright Brothers knew or should have known the basis \nfor its protest by no later than April 15, when the agency notified the protester that it had \ncompleted its corrective action of reevaluating existing proposals and reawarded the contract to Premier.  RFD, exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1.  Thus, in order to be timel y, \nWright Brothers was required to file its protest within 10 days of April 15, i.e. , by \nApril 25.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  Because Wright Brothers did not file its pr otest until  \nMay 25, the protest is untimely.\n2  Id; Magnum Multimedia supra; Crown Point Sys. , \nB-413940, B -413940.2, Jan. 11, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 19 at 8 (finding protest ground \n \n2 The protester also takes issue with the agency\u2019s conduct in responding to its inquiry  \nregarding the corrective action.  Resp. to RFD at 1- 2.  The record reflects  that, in \nresponse to the protester\u2019s inquiry, the contracting officer twice stated that she would \nneed to confer with other agency personnel before she could provide additional information.  RFD, exh. 2, April 15 Emails at 1; RFD, exh. 3, April 28- 29 Emails.   While \nthe agency\u2019s conduct is not a model response, the protester did not submit a request for \na debriefing until 13 days after the agency confirmed, by email, that the agency had reawarded the contract to the same offeror (Premier) .  Nor did Wright Brothers file this \nprotest until 40 days after the April  15 email from the agency.   \nAs noted, our r egulations contain strict rules requiring the timely submission of  protests; \nto ensure meeting these timeliness requirements, a protester has the obligation to diligently pursue the information that forms the basis for its protest.

Here , the protester had all the \ninformation that formed the basis of its protest by the April  15 email correspondence \nwith the agency.  In this connection, waiting 40 days for some unspecified \u201cadditional \ninformation\u201d that the agency might provide,  does not demonstrate a protester\u2019s diligent \npursuit of  the information that forms the basis for its protest,  such that its protest can be \nconstrued as timely.

The protester did request a debriefing, and \nthe agency admittedly did not provide one.3  To the extent the protester is arguing that \nits protest should be deemed timely based on the required debriefing exception to the \ngeneral timeliness rule, however, we find that any debriefing here would not have been \na \u201crequired\u201d debriefing , because it was not timely requested.

        "Parties":"4K Global -ACC JV, LLC--Reconsideration",
        "Summary":"Request for reconsideration is dismissed where the request, which is based on a holding in a U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision issued after our Office\u2019s bid protest decision, does not show that the protest decision contains errors of fact or law that would warrant reversal or modification of the decision.  \nDECISION  \n 4K Global -ACC JV, LLC (4K Global), a small business of Augusta, Georgia, requests \nreconsideration of our decision in 4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, B -423092, Jan.  15, 2025, \n2025 CPD \u00b6  31, in which we denied the firm\u2019s protest of the award of a contract to \nRoundhouse PBN -Tepa EC 2 JV, a small business of Warner Robins, Georgia, under \nrequest for proposals  No. W912HN24R3006 (RFP).  The RFP was  issued by the \nDepartment of the Army, Corps of Engineers (Corps) for building repairs.   4K Global \ncontends, based on its interpretation of the holding in a United States Court of Federal Claims (COFC) decision issued after the issuance of our protest decision, that our decision contains an error of law.  \n \nWe dismiss the request for reconsideration.  \n \nOn September 28, 2024, the Corps notified 4K Global that its proposal was not selected for award under the RFP because the firm\u2019s project labor agreement (PLA) \u201cdid not comply\u201d with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra at 2.  In this regard, the solicitation required offerors to \nsubmit a PLA \u201cin accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 33 and FAR clause 52.222- 34.\u201d  \nId.  The Corps found that 4K Global\u2019s PLA did \u201cnot meet the minimum requirements\u201d \nidentified  in FAR provision  52.222- 33(c) and was therefore ineligible for award.  Id.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423092.2  Specifically, the agency found that the PLA \u201cdid not meet the basic definition for such an \nagreement\u201d because it was labeled as an agreement between 4K Global and the Corps, was \u201cnot signed by anyone other than the Offeror and ma[de]  no representation that any \nparty --let alone a labor organization--has entered into the agreement or is bound by it.\u201d   \nId. at 3 (quoting AR, Tab  5, Source Selection Decision Document at  10).  \n In its protest, 4K Global challenged the agency\u2019s determination that the firm\u2019s PLA did not meet the applicable FAR requirements.  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra.  \nSpecifically, 4K Global argued that its PLA met the applicable requirements because the FAR provision does not require a \u201csigned PLA,\u201d but only a draft PLA that an awardee would later negotiate with an unspecified labor organization or organizations.  Id.  at 4.  \n4K Global also asserted that an inadequate PLA \u201ccannot be a basis to reject\u201d its proposal because the PLA is an obligation for contract performance that 4K Global needed only to acknowledge and accept through its proposal submission.  Id.  In this \nregard, our decision noted that 4K Global\u2019s primary complaint appeared to be that it was \nunreasonable for the agency to include the PLA requirement in the solicitation.  See id.  \nat 4-5, citing Comments at 4 (\u201cTo impose this requirement [for a signed PLA] upon 4K \n(and\/or other Contractors) would be improper because 4K would be expected to enter into a PLA prior to being awarded a project contrary to the express requirement of the Solicitation.\u201d).  \n On January 15, our Office denied 4K Global\u2019s protest.  In denying the protest, we noted that the referenced FAR clause defines a PLA as \u201ca pre- hire collective bargaining \nagreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project,\u201d entered into \u201cprior to the \naward\u201d and mai ntained \u201cthroughout the life of the contract.\u201d  FAR 52.222- 34(a), (b).   \nWe also noted that the FAR provision obligates offerors to \u201c[n]egotiate or become a \nparty to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations\u201d and includes a \nsubsection that specifies six requirements for any PLA, including that it \u201c[b]ind the Offeror and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply.\u201d  FAR 52.222- 33(b), (c).   \n Based on these FAR sections, we concluded that the agency reasonably rejected 4K Global\u2019s proposal based on the submission of a PLA that \u201cneither evidenced that 4K Global had negotiated or become a party to an agreement with any labor organization, nor identified any subcontractors who have agreed to be bound to comply with the PLA.\u201d  Id.  at 4.  As relevant here, we also dismissed as untimely 4K Global\u2019s argument \nthat the solicitation\u2019s PLA requirements were unreasonable, finding that the argument constitut ed an allegation of solicitation improprieties that was required to be raised prior \nto the proposal due date.

United States, 174 Fed. Cl. 437 (2025), issued on January  21, \u201cstruck down the mandate of President Biden\u2019s \nExecutive Order 14063 regarding the [PLA] requirement.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at  1-2.  Our  Page 3 B-423092.2  Bid Protest Regulations provide that to obtain reconsideration, the requesting party \nmust set forth the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification of the decision is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not previously considered.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.14(a) .  Our Regulations further provide that we \nwill summarily dismiss any request for reconsideration that fails to state a valid basis for reconsideration.  Id . \u00a7 21.14(c) .  For  the reasons that follow, 4K Global has  not provided \na valid basis for reconsideration.  \n As an initial matter, 4K Global\u2019s reliance on the COFC\u2019s MVL USA decision as the sole \nbasis for its request for reconsideration is misplaced.  As our Office has previously explained, while we have traditionally given careful consideration to decisions of the court, we are not bound by them.  See, e.g., Kingdomware Techs. --Recon., B-407232.2, \nDec. 13, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  351 at  3.  We note further that 4K Global\u2019s request for \nreconsideration does not elaborate on the nature of the \u201cerror of law\u201d alleged in our prior decision or how the holding in MVL USA applies to the fact s and issues presented in 4K \nGlobal\u2019s protest.  Instead, it simply states that, \u201c[i]n light of the MVL USA, Inc.  opinion \nstriking down President Biden\u2019s Executive Order  14063, Project Labor Agreement \nMandate, the GAO\u2019s decision contains an error of law.\u201d  See Req. for Recon. at  2. \n Moreover, we disagree with 4K Global\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s holding in MVL USA is relevant or applicable to the matter at hand in 4K Global\u2019s protest.   First, we note \nfundamental differences in the procedural posture in the COFC case.  Specifically, the pre-award protests filed in the MVL USA decision challenged the propriety of including \nthe PLA requirement in different solicitations for different procurements.\n1  See generally, \nMVL USA, Inc., et al.,  supra.  The court, considering the timeliness of one of the \nprotests under the Federal Circuit\u2019s Blue & Gold standard, concluded that the protest was timely filed because it challenged the terms of the solicitation \u201cprior to the close of \nthe bidding process.\u201d  See id. at  471-473 ( citing Blue & Gold Fleet, L. P. v. United \nStates, 492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2007 )).     \n \nBy contrast, 4K Global\u2019s protest was filed after award.  Indeed, our decision specifically \nnoted that \u201cthe protester\u2019s true argument appears not to be that the draft PLA it submitted met the solicitation\u2019s requirements, but that the solicitation should not have \nrequired a specific, definite PLA.\u201d  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra at  4.  Because our \ntimeliness rules require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation \nthat are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial submiss ions be filed \nbefore that time, see 4 C.F.R.  \u00a7 21.2(a)(1), we found that 4K Global\u2019s challenges to the \nsolicitation\u2019s PLA requirements were untimely.  Id. at 5.

Levine, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.  \nDIGEST  \n Request for reconsideration is dismissed where the request, which is based on a holding in a U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision issued after our Office\u2019s bid protest decision, does not show that the protest decision contains errors of fact or law that would warrant reversal or modification of the decision.  \nDECISION  \n 4K Global -ACC JV, LLC (4K Global), a small business of Augusta, Georgia, requests \nreconsideration of our decision in 4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, B -423092, Jan.  15, 2025, \n2025 CPD \u00b6  31, in which we denied the firm\u2019s protest of the award of a contract to \nRoundhouse PBN -Tepa EC 2 JV, a small business of Warner Robins, Georgia, under \nrequest for proposals  No. W912HN24R3006 (RFP).  The RFP was  issued by the \nDepartment of the Army, Corps of Engineers (Corps) for building repairs.   4K Global \ncontends, based on its interpretation of the holding in a United States Court of Federal Claims (COFC) decision issued after the issuance of our protest decision, that our decision contains an error of law.  \n \nWe dismiss the request for reconsideration.  \n \nOn September 28, 2024, the Corps notified 4K Global that its proposal was not selected for award under the RFP because the firm\u2019s project labor agreement (PLA) \u201cdid not comply\u201d with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra at 2.  In this regard, the solicitation required offerors to \nsubmit a PLA \u201cin accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 33 and FAR clause 52.222- 34.\u201d  \nId.  The Corps found that 4K Global\u2019s PLA did \u201cnot meet the minimum requirements\u201d \nidentified  in FAR provision  52.222- 33(c) and was therefore ineligible for award.  Id.  DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423092.2  Specifically, the agency found that the PLA \u201cdid not meet the basic definition for such an \nagreement\u201d because it was labeled as an agreement between 4K Global and the Corps, was \u201cnot signed by anyone other than the Offeror and ma[de]  no representation that any \nparty --let alone a labor organization--has entered into the agreement or is bound by it.\u201d   \nId. at 3 (quoting AR, Tab  5, Source Selection Decision Document at  10).  \n In its protest, 4K Global challenged the agency\u2019s determination that the firm\u2019s PLA did not meet the applicable FAR requirements.  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra.  \nSpecifically, 4K Global argued that its PLA met the applicable requirements because the FAR provision does not require a \u201csigned PLA,\u201d but only a draft PLA that an awardee would later negotiate with an unspecified labor organization or organizations.  Id.  at 4.  \n4K Global also asserted that an inadequate PLA \u201ccannot be a basis to reject\u201d its proposal because the PLA is an obligation for contract performance that 4K Global needed only to acknowledge and accept through its proposal submission.  Id.  In this \nregard, our decision noted that 4K Global\u2019s primary complaint appeared to be that it was \nunreasonable for the agency to include the PLA requirement in the solicitation.  See id.  \nat 4-5, citing Comments at 4 (\u201cTo impose this requirement [for a signed PLA] upon 4K \n(and\/or other Contractors) would be improper because 4K would be expected to enter into a PLA prior to being awarded a project contrary to the express requirement of the Solicitation.\u201d).  \n On January 15, our Office denied 4K Global\u2019s protest.  In denying the protest, we noted that the referenced FAR clause defines a PLA as \u201ca pre- hire collective bargaining \nagreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project,\u201d entered into \u201cprior to the \naward\u201d and mai ntained \u201cthroughout the life of the contract.\u201d  FAR 52.222- 34(a), (b).   \nWe also noted that the FAR provision obligates offerors to \u201c[n]egotiate or become a \nparty to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations\u201d and includes a \nsubsection that specifies six requirements for any PLA, including that it \u201c[b]ind the Offeror and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply.\u201d  FAR 52.222- 33(b), (c).   \n Based on these FAR sections, we concluded that the agency reasonably rejected 4K Global\u2019s proposal based on the submission of a PLA that \u201cneither evidenced that 4K Global had negotiated or become a party to an agreement with any labor organization, nor identified any subcontractors who have agreed to be bound to comply with the PLA.\u201d  Id.  at 4.  As relevant here, we also dismissed as untimely 4K Global\u2019s argument \nthat the solicitation\u2019s PLA requirements were unreasonable, finding that the argument constitut ed an allegation of solicitation improprieties that was required to be raised prior \nto the proposal due date.

Data Sols. , LLC, B-417655 et al., \nSept.  18, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6  325 at  6; see 4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1).    \n In seeking reconsideration, 4K Global asserts that our prior decision \u201ccontains an error of law\u201d because a COFC decision, MVL USA, Inc., et al. v. United States, 174 Fed. Cl. 437 (2025), issued on January  21, \u201cstruck down the mandate of President Biden\u2019s \nExecutive Order 14063 regarding the [PLA] requirement.\u201d  Req. for Recon. at  1-2.  Our  Page 3 B-423092.2  Bid Protest Regulations provide that to obtain reconsideration, the requesting party \nmust set forth the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification of the decision is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not previously considered.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.14(a) .  Our Regulations further provide that we \nwill summarily dismiss any request for reconsideration that fails to state a valid basis for reconsideration.  Id . \u00a7 21.14(c) .  For  the reasons that follow, 4K Global has  not provided \na valid basis for reconsideration.  \n As an initial matter, 4K Global\u2019s reliance on the COFC\u2019s MVL USA decision as the sole \nbasis for its request for reconsideration is misplaced.  As our Office has previously explained, while we have traditionally given careful consideration to decisions of the court, we are not bound by them.  See, e.g., Kingdomware Techs. --Recon., B-407232.2, \nDec. 13, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  351 at  3.  We note further that 4K Global\u2019s request for \nreconsideration does not elaborate on the nature of the \u201cerror of law\u201d alleged in our prior decision or how the holding in MVL USA applies to the fact s and issues presented in 4K \nGlobal\u2019s protest.  Instead, it simply states that, \u201c[i]n light of the MVL USA, Inc.  opinion \nstriking down President Biden\u2019s Executive Order  14063, Project Labor Agreement \nMandate, the GAO\u2019s decision contains an error of law.\u201d  See Req. for Recon. at  2. \n Moreover, we disagree with 4K Global\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s holding in MVL USA is relevant or applicable to the matter at hand in 4K Global\u2019s protest.   First, we note \nfundamental differences in the procedural posture in the COFC case.  Specifically, the pre-award protests filed in the MVL USA decision challenged the propriety of including \nthe PLA requirement in different solicitations for different procurements.\n1  See generally, \nMVL USA, Inc., et al.,  supra.  The court, considering the timeliness of one of the \nprotests under the Federal Circuit\u2019s Blue & Gold standard, concluded that the protest was timely filed because it challenged the terms of the solicitation \u201cprior to the close of \nthe bidding process.\u201d  See id. at  471-473 ( citing Blue & Gold Fleet, L. P. v. United \nStates, 492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2007 )).     \n \nBy contrast, 4K Global\u2019s protest was filed after award.  Indeed, our decision specifically \nnoted that \u201cthe protester\u2019s true argument appears not to be that the draft PLA it submitted met the solicitation\u2019s requirements, but that the solicitation should not have \nrequired a specific, definite PLA.\u201d  4K Global -ACC JV, LLC, supra at  4.  Because our \ntimeliness rules require that a protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation \nthat are apparent prior to the closing time for receipt of initial submiss ions be filed \nbefore that time, see 4 C.F.R.  \u00a7 21.2(a)(1), we found that 4K Global\u2019s challenges to the \nsolicitation\u2019s PLA requirements were untimely.  Id. at 5.  Given the procedural \ndifferences with the protests, 4K Global\u2019s reliance on the holding in the pre- award, MVL \n \n1 To the extent the court\u2019s holding, as the protester argues, \u201cstruck down the mandate of \nPresident Biden\u2019s Executive Order 14063 regarding the [PLA] requirement,\u201d Req. for \nRecon. at  1-2, it did so with respect to the agencies\u2019 decisions to include the PLA \nrequirement in solicitations without first considering its effect on full and open competition required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA).

This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423341 et al.  Chase, Maryland, under fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR) No. FA8773- 24-R-\n0002, issued by the Department of the Air Force for intranet control support services to \noperate, manage, and defend the Air Force\u2019s portion of the Department of Defense information network.  The protester argues that various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of the offerors\u2019 price proposals was unreasonable, the agency engaged in \nmisleading discussions with SMS, and the best -value decision is flawed.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on May 21, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, set aside for small business holders of the Department of the Army\u2019s responsive strategic sourcing for services multiple- award \nindefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement \n(COS) at 3.  SMS was the incumbent contractor and previously performed the same services sought by this procurement.  The FOPR contemplated issuance of a fixed- price \ntask order with a period of performance to include a 2- month transition period, a 10-\nmonth base period, four 12- month option periods, and a 6- month option to extend.  \nAgency Report (AR), Tab 35, Instruction to Offerors (ITO) Amend. 1 at 9.   \n The FOPR stated that proposals would be evaluated under the following factors:  technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  at 15.  The technical factor would be rated \nas either acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Past performance was to be assessed and \nassigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, \nlimited or no confidence.  Id. at 18.  Regarding price, the FOPR stated that total \nevaluated price would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced pricing.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR required that offerors submit \nprofessional employee compensation plans and stated they would be evaluated in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional \nEmployees.  Id. at 20.   \n The FOPR further stated:   \n \nProposals must be technically acceptable to be awardable.  Past performance is considered more important than Price, and the \nGovernment may choose to trade past performance for price on \ntechnically acceptable proposals. . . .  All offerors judged to have a \n\u201cSubstantial Confidence\u201d past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision \nAuthority shall make an integrated assess ment award decision to the \nofferor deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  \n \nId. at 14.  \n  Page 3 B-423341 et al.  The agency received nine proposals in response to the solicitation, including from SMS \nand Abacus.  COS at 4.  Following the initial evaluation of proposals, the agency elected to engage in technical interchanges with five offerors and subsequently engaged in interchanges with four of those offerors regarding their professional \nemployee compensation plans.  Id.  at 10.  In its final evaluation of proposals, the \nagency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were acceptable under the technical factor and assigned both offerors ratings of substantial confidence under the past \nperformance factor.  AR, Tab 120, Fair Opportunity Decision Document (FODD) at 22.  The agency also concluded that both offerors submitted realistic professional employee compensation plans; SM S\u2019s final proposed price was $128,545,851, and Abacus\u2019s final \nproposed price was $116,202,405.  Id.   \n On February 11, 2025, the contracting officer, who also served as the source selection authority (SSA), awarded the task order to Abacus and provided SMS with a combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  On February 21, SMS filed its protest.\n1 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe gravamen of the protest is that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate Abacus\u2019s \nlower price as presenting a risk to successful contract performance.  The protester also \nargues that because the agency\u2019s discussions led  SMS to increase its price, the award \nto Abacus at a lower price demonstrates  that the agency\u2019s discussions with SMS were \nmisleading.   We address these arguments below.  \n \nTimeliness  \n \nAs an initial matter, the intervenor repeatedly argues that the protest should be \ndismissed in its entirety as premature.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 3- 6; Intervenor \nReply in Support of Req. for Dismissal at 1- 3; Intervenor Comments at 2, 4- 6.  Abacus \nargues that the protest was prematurely filed prior to the conclusion of SMS\u2019s \n\u201cenhanced debriefing\u201d because SMS was awaiting answers to questions submitted to the agency after it received its combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 5.  The agency concurs with the \nintervenor\u2019s request.  Agency Concurrence with Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 1.  \n As noted, the procurement here was conducted using FAR subpart 16.5 procedures, \nwhich state that \u201c[t]he procedures at [FAR] 15.506 shall be followed when providing \n[post award] debriefing to unsuccessful awardees.\u201d  FAR 16.505(b)(6)(ii).  Section \n15.506 st ates:  \u201c An offeror, upon its written request received by the agency within 3 \ndays after the date on which that offeror has received notification of contract award . . . \n \n1 The awarded value of the task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this \nprocurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders \nunder multiple- award IDIQ contracts awarded under the authority of title 10 of the \nUnited  States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).   Page 4 B-423341 et al.  shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract \naward.\u201d  However, the agency did not wait for the protester to request a debriefing as contemplated by FAR section 15.506 and instead provided the protester a written debriefing along with its unsuccessful offeror notice.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  \n In the unsuccessful offeror notice, the agency stated that \u201cin accordance with [Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)] 215.506- 70 the Government \nprovides each offeror the opportunity to submit additional written questions . . . in writing, no later than Friday, 14 February 2025.\u201d  Id. at 2.  In this regard, DFARS section \n215.506- 70(a) provides procedures for an \u201cenhanced debriefing\u201d and states that \ncontracting officers shall \u201c[p]rovide an opportunity to submit additional questions related to the required debriefing not later than 2 business days after receiving the [post -award] \ndebriefing.\u201d  This same regulation also states that a post -award debriefing is not \nconsidered to be concluded until the later of \u201c(1) the date that the [post -award] \ndebriefing is delivered, orally or in writing; or (2) if additional written questions related to \nthe debriefing are timely received, the date the agency delivers its written response.\u201d  DFARS 215.506- 70(c).  Since the debriefing was provided to SMS on February 11, the \ndue date for submission of additional questions as required by DFARS section 215.506-70 was February 13, not February 14 as stated in the unsuccessful offeror notice.  The protest explained:  \n \nIn SMS\u2019s Unsuccessful Offeror Notice, the Contracting Officer stated that \u201cin accordance with DFARS 215.506- 70 the Government provides each \nofferor the opportunity to submit additional written questions as part of \nan enhanced debriefing.\u201d []  The Contracting Officer requested the \nquestions by February 14, 2025, and SMS submitted questions on this date.  However, February 14, 2025, is three days after SMS received its \n[post award]  debriefing on February 11, 2025, and DFARS 215.506-\n70(a) requires written quest ions to be submitted \u201cnot later than 2 \nbusiness days after receiving the [ post award]  debriefing.\u201d  Therefore, \nwhile SMS did submit written questions for debriefing, in an abundance of caution regarding GAO\u2019s protest deadlines, SMS is filing the current protest.  \n Protest at 2 n.2.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests. These timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly dis rupting or \ndelaying the procurement process.  Beckman Coulter, Inc. , B-421748, July 28, 2023, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 180 at 3.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  \n  Page 5 B-423341 et al.  An exception to our general timeliness rule is a protest that challenges \u201ca procurement \nconducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required,\u201d where a protest would be considered timely if f iled \nwithin 10 days after the debriefing.  Id.  This exception to our timeliness rules  does not \napply where an agency provides a debriefing that is not required.  Exceptional Software \nStrategies, Inc. , B-416232, July 12, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 237 at 5.  Consequently, where \na debriefing is not legally required, a protester that delays the filing of a protest until after that debriefing may be untimely as to any grounds of protest it knew or should have known more than 10 days before filing the protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1) -(2); Done \nBy Native, LLC , B-422270, Mar. 29, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 87 at 3.  \n In order to extend its debriefing, section 215.506- 70(a) of the DFARS required the \nprotester to submit questions to the agency no later than two business days after receiving its written debriefing on February 11.  The protester submitted its questions on February 14, one day later than the deadline set by the regulation.  Therefore, because SMS did not timely submit its questions pursuant to DFARS section 215.506- 70(a), the \ndebriefing was considered to be concluded on the date the debriefing was delivered,  \ni.e., February 11.  Under these circumstances, the protest was required to be filed within \n10 days of when the protester knew or should have known its basis of protest and SMS could not wait to file the protest until the agency provided answers to its untimely  \nsubmitted questions.  Accordingly, we conclude that the protest was not premature and was timely filed.\n2 \n Price Evaluation  \n \nThe protester argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus\u2019s proposal \nunder FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional \nEmployees .  According to SMS, it proposed rates largely in line with its incumbent rates, \nand the agency failed to recognize that Abacus\u2019s lower total price--10 percent less than the total price proposed by SMS --is clearly unrealistic.  The protester argues that \n \n2 The intervenor also raised several other arguments for dismissal, including SMS\u2019s \nallegation that the agency should have found Abacus unacceptable under the management\/staffing plan subfactor because Abacus\u2019s proposed price was lower than the price propos ed by SMS.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 8.  By itself, the fact that \nAbacus proposed a lower price fails to demonstrate that Abacus\u2019s proposal could not have included an acceptable response to the information required by the solicitation.  Indeed, the FOPR did not require that the agency consider Abacus\u2019s proposed price \nunder the management\/staffing plan subfactor, and the protester provided no other support for its argument that Abacus should have been found unacceptable.  S ee \nProtest at 14- 15.  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency action \n(e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.

Electronic Protest Docketing System No.  25; 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5(f).  \nWe denied the intervenor\u2019s requests to di smiss SMS\u2019s other protest grounds.   Page 6 B-423341 et al.  Abacus will not be able to retain the professional employees required for successful \ncontract performance, and the agency should have rejected its proposal.  Protest at  10-\n13.  The agency argues that its evaluation was fair, reasonable, and consistent with the \nterms of the FOPR and FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  10-\n18. \n The purpose of a review of compensation for professional employees is to evaluate each offeror\u2019s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering the realism \nof the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruiting and retention.  ENGlobal Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc., B -419612.3, Dec. 15, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 12 at 11.  FAR \nprovision 52.222- 46 requires a two- prong evaluation of professional employee \ncompensation plans.  The first prong is, in effect, a price realism evaluation of proposed compensation, to determine whether an offeror understands the contract requirements and has proposed a compensation plan appropriate for those requirements.  IBSS Corp. , B-422757 et al. , Oct. 24, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 258 at 8.  The second prong \nrequires an agency to determine whether a proposal \u201cenvision[s] compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors\u201d by comparing proposed compensation rates to those of the incumbent.  Guidehouse LLP; Jacobs Tech. Inc. , B-420860 et al. , \nOct. 13, 2022, 2022 CPD \u00b6 257 at 7.   \n The comparison of an offeror\u2019s proposed professional employee compensation to that of the incumbent contractor is a separate inquiry from the realism of the proposed plan and its impact on recruiting and retention.  The Bionetics Corp. , B-419727, July 13, \n2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 259 at 5.  If the agency determines that the awardee\u2019s proposal envisions lower compensation levels compared to the incumbent contractor, then the \nagency must further evaluate the awardee\u2019s proposed compensation plan on the basis of maintaining program continuity, among other considerations.  FAR provision 52.222-46(b); OBXtek, Inc., B -422057, B -422057.2, Jan 2, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 18 at 6.  \n Here, the FOPR required that offerors submit \u201ca total compensation plan setting forth base rate hourly salary and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract,\u201d to include a professional compensation matrix and a professional compensation plan narrative.  ITO Amend. 1 at 10- 12.  The FOPR also \nrequired that offerors submit a pricing labor matrix, a template of which was provided with the FOPR as an attachment.  Id.  at 12.  The FOPR stated that the offeror\u2019s price \nproposal would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced \npricing based upon the total evaluated price proposed.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR \nstated:  \u201cThe Professional Employee Compensation Plan will be evaluated for realism and is separate from the [total evaluated price] evaluation.\u201d  Id.   \n With respect to the evaluation of the professional employee compensation plans, the FOPR provided:  \n \nThe Government will compare proposed rates to incumbent rates if available.  If necessary (for example, where comparison to incumbent rates is not feasible), the Government may validate the offeror\u2019s  Page 7 B-423341 et al.  supporting data and use a variety of resources and methods to evaluate \nthe realism of the offeror\u2019s Professional Compensation Plan.  This includes, but is not limited to:  comparing prices paid on prior or similar contracts, comparison of proposed pricing from multiple offerors, market data from one or multiple sources (e.g., Watson & Wyatt, Economic Research Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Salary.com, etc.), or a combination of the above.  \nId. at 20.  The FOPR further noted that for proposed compensation that was lower than \nthe incumbent prices, the agency would evaluate the proposed compensation on the basis of \u201cmaintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality work, and \navailability of required competent professional service employees.\u201d  Id.  \n The record shows that the agency reviewed Abacus\u2019s professional employee compensation plan and concluded:  \u201cAbacus\u2019s proposed fringe benefits were considered when evaluating total compensation, and the Government determined they proposed sufficient fringe benefits for recruitment and retention when compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.\u201d  AR, Tab 112, Abacus Evaluation at 25.   The record further shows that the agency computed average \ncompensation rates across all offerors by labor category and used this data along with market data from Economic Research Institute (ERI) and Salary.com to assess the labor category rates proposed by each offeror.  Id.   The agency also compared \nproposed rates to incumbent rates, and explained its evaluation, in pertinent part, as follows:  \n \nThe Government noted any incumbent rates that were significantly lower (more than 4 [percent] ) than market data and the competition average to \nassess the reliability of the incumbent rate for recruitment of new employees and retention of current employees.  The 4 [percent]  measure \nwas judgmentally determined by the Government considering the current employer cost index of 4.1 [percent] , meaning that a difference of more \nthan 4 [percent]  is not readily explained by fluctuations in the labor \nmarket.  For thos e labor categories where the incumbent was significantly \nlower than market and competition, the Government determined it would evaluate proposed rates further against the market and competition data, [in accordance with]  the FOPR and FAR 52.222- 46, to consider the \nimpact of the proposed rate on recruiting and retention, whether the rate is realistic, and to determine the offeror\u2019s ability to provide uninterrupted high- quality work.  . . .  Where the Government found the incumbent rate \nto be reliable, and the offeror\u2019s proposed rate was above the incumbent \ncompensation levels, the proposed rate was determined to be realistic.  \n \n* * * * * \n In many cases the incumbent evaluation rate was well above (between 4 [percent]  and 42 [percent] ) market and competition.  Where the proposed \nrate was below the incumbent rate (envisioning compensation levels  Page 8 B-423341 et al.  lower than the incumbent), the Government evaluated the proposed rate \n\u201con the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality \nwork, and availability of required competent professional service employees \u201d by comparing to the competition average, Salary.com market \ndata, and ERI market data.  Proposed rates higher than 4 [percent]  below \nany of these data points were determined to be realistic.  \n For rates where the incumbent rate was potentially unreliable as described above or where no incumbent rate was available, the Government further evaluated against both market data points and the competitive average.  The Government determined a rate to be \nunrealistic if it was 4  [percent]  or more below all data points, including the \ncompetitive average, Salary.com market data, ERI market data, and the incumbent rate (if available and reliable).  \n Id. at 26- 27.   \n The record shows that two- thirds of Abacus\u2019s proposed rates were higher than the \nincumbent rates; the one- third of Abacus\u2019s rates that fell below the incumbent rates \nwere otherwise higher than at least one of the rates used by the agency for comparison (i.e., average competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  Id. at 28- 29.  The agency \nconcluded that the price proposal submitted by Abacus was complete, reasonable, and balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  Id.  at 30.   \n In contrast, in its evaluation of SMS, the agency identified six labor category rates that \nwere more than four percent below the rates used for comparison; in other words, SMS \nproposed rates below the incumbent rate, or where an incumbent rate was unavailable \nor unreliable, SMS proposed rates more than four percent below the average competition rate, ERI, and Salary.com.  The record does not support the protester\u2019s argument that Abacus\u2019s proposal should have been rejected because of its much lower price.  O n the contrary, the record shows that Abacus\u2019s proposed labor rates were all \nhigher than either the incumbent rates or the other data used by the agency ( i.e., \naverage competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s conclusion that Abacus\u2019s professional employee compensation plan was realistic and find that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the requirements of FAR provision 52.222- 46.\n3  \n \n3 The protester maintains that the agency\u2019s evaluation is flawed because the agency \ncompared base hourly salary rates rather than fully burdened rates that would include fringe benefits.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 4- 7.  However, as explained by the \nagency, rather than using fully burdened rates, its evaluation utilized incumbent payroll data because this information provided actual employee salary information.  COS at 11-12.  Our Office has previously found that an agency\u2019s use of burdened labor rates in an evaluation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 did not permit meaningful consideration of \nthe compensation to be paid to employees.   See MicroTechnologies, LLC , B-413091,  \n(continued...)   Page 9 B-423341 et al.   \nThe protester also argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus\u2019s price under Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) provision 252.204- 7024 \nand would have found Abacus to be unacceptable if it compared Abacus\u2019s rates to historical pri ces paid.  Protest at 13- 14; 2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 7 -8.  SMS \ncontends that under this DFARS clause, the agency was required to evaluate the price risk of Abacus\u2019s total proposed price.  \n The DFARS provision 252.204- 7024 defines price risk as \u201ca measure of whether a \nproposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.\u201d  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(a).  The DFARS mandates that the \nsuppl ier performance risk system (SPRS) be used in the evaluation of an offeror\u2019s \nperformance and requires the contracting officer to \u201c consider SPRS risk assessments \nduring the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows:  . . . (2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is \nconsistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. \u201d  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(c)(2).  \n The agency argues that it properly evaluated Abacus\u2019s price in accordance with this requirement, and consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  MOL at 18- 22.  The \ncontracting officer explains that SPRS functionality is currently limited to running a search based on a part number or other identification (such as a national item identification number or national stock number).  The contracting officer states that for 100 percent service contracts that are not associated with a part number or product code, the pr ice risk for that particular service is not available.  COS at 22- 23.  The \nrecord includes a declaration from the SPRS program manager, in which he confirms:  \n \nAt present time, if a service contract does not have an associated [Product Service Code (PSC)] or Manufacturer [Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)] Code with a Part Number or [National Item Identification Number (NIIN)], the SPRS Item\/Price Risk Repo rt search will not be found \nwhich is equivalent to yielding a \u201cnot available\u201d result, indicating there is no performance risk information in SPRS for that particular PSC\/part number combination.  \n AR, Tab 130, Decl. of SPRS Program Manager at 2.   \n \n \nB-413091.2, Aug. 11, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 219 at 8- 14.  Further, as noted, the agency \nalso separately evaluated Abacus\u2019s proposed fringe benefits and determined they were sufficient for recruitment and retention \u201cwhen compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.\u201d  AR, Tab 112, Abacus  Evaluation at 25.  We find this \nexplanation is reasonable and that the evaluation satisfies the FAR requirement to evaluate each offeror\u2019s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering \nthe realism of the proposed professional compensati on and its impact upon recruiting \nand retention.   Page 10 B-423341 et al.  On this record, we find the agency\u2019s explanation of how it used the SPRS reasonable \nand consistent with the requirements of DFARS provision 252.204- 7024.  Accordingly, \nthis allegation is denied.4 \n After review of the initial agency report, the protester additionally contends that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis.  SMS argues that despite Abacus\u2019s lower price, Abacus proposed labor category rates that were well abov e the incumbent rate, and the record fails to document why these rates were found \nto be reasonable.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 3 -4.  The agency argues that this \nallegation fails to state a valid basis of protest because the FOPR did not require a pri ce \nreasonableness assessment of individual labor category rates, and it properly evaluated total evaluated prices for reasonableness, consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 7 -9. \n We agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require that the agency assess whether individual labor category rates were too high.  As our decisions have stated, the purpose of a price reasonableness review is to determine whether the prices offered are too high, as opposed to too low.  Tetra Tech, Inc. , B-409095, B -409095.2, Jan. 17, \n2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 108 at 7.  The solicitation clearly stated that total evaluated price would be evaluated for price reasonableness.  ITO Amend. 1 at 14, 19.  There w as \nnothing in the solicitation that provided for the agency to analyze individual labor rates for reasonableness.  Accordingly, we dismiss this argument because it fails to state a valid basis of protest.  Eagle Hill Consulting, LLC , supra.  \n \nMisleading Discussions  \n The protester argues that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS because the agency informed SMS that some of its rates were unrealistically low and led SMS to increase its price yet made award to Abacus at a much lower evaluated price.  Pro test at 15.  The agency argues that exchanges were not misleading, and it \nreasonably  identified rates proposed by SMS that were found to be unrealistically low, \nbut did not require that SMS increase them.  The agency avers that SMS elected to \nincrease its price  rather than justify the rates it initially proposed and that SMS\u2019s \ndecision to raise its price fails to demonstrate that  the agency\u2019s exchanges were \nmisleading.   MOL at 22- 25. \n The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not, as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement here.  Engineering Design Techs., Inc. , B-413281, Sept. 21, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 265 at 5.  In this regard, FAR \n \n4 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to determine whether Abacus had a \nscore in the SPRS as required by the FOPR and DFARS provision 252.204- 7019 and \nclause 252.204- 7020.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 2- 3.  After review of the \nsupplemental agency report, the protester withdrew this allegation.  Supp. Comments at 1.  Page 11 B-423341 et al.  section 16.505 does not establish specific requirements for discussions in a task order \ncompetition; nonetheless, when exchanges with the agency occur in task order competitions, they must be fair and not misleading.  CGI Fed. Inc. , B-403570 et al. ,  \nNov. 5, 2010, 2011 CPD \u00b6 32 at 9.  In our decisions addressing an agency\u2019s obligations in conducting discussions under FAR part 15, we have stated that an agency may not mislead an offeror through the framing of a discussion question into responding in a manner that does not address the agency\u2019s actual concerns, or otherwise misinform the \nofferor concerning a problem with its proposal.  Refinery Assocs. of Texas, Inc. ,  \nB-410911.2, Mar. 18, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 116 at 6.  \n As discussed, the agency identified six labor category rates that it considered to be unrealistic and issued a notice to SMS.\n5  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation \nInterchange 003 at 2- 3.  That notice stated:  \n \nSMS may choose to revise all or some of the rates at their own discretion or provide adequate justification that the current proposed rates are realistic and meet the criteria in FAR 52.222- 46.  If SMS revises their \nproposal, please utilize an updated complete Professional Compensation Matrix (Attachment 7).  If necessary, the Subcontractors may provide this updated attachment to the Government directly.  The supporting information for the proposed professional compensation information shall be included in the Contractor Response section below.  \n AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.  The record shows that SMS increased its price, and its final proposal was found to be complete, \nreasonable, balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  \nAR, Tab 111, SMS Evaluation at 30.   \n The protester argues that blaming SMS for raising its price is not a fair response.  SMS contends that it had no choice but to raise its price and insists that making award at a lower price is evidence the discussions were misleading because it contradicts  the \ninformation given to SMS during exchanges.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 8- 9.  \nHowever, the protester has not shown that following the price evaluation procedures, as discussed above, the agency\u2019s concerns that the specific rates identified in the notice were incorrect.  And rather than give SMS no choice but to raise its price, the notice \nalternatively afforded SMS the opportunity to provide adequate justification that the initially proposed rates were realistic and met the criteria in FAR provisio n 52.222- 46.  \nThe protester elected to increase its price rather than provide additional justification to substantiate its initial rates.  Thus, the agency did not mislead the protester during discussions and instead properly identified a concern with the protester\u2019s low rates.  In sum, the record does not support the protester\u2019s contention that the agency misled SMS into increasing its labor rates and price.  Accordingly, we deny this allegation.  \n \n \n5 The agency also identified rates proposed by SMS\u2019s subcontractors found to be \nunrealistic.  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.   Page 12 B-423341 et al.  Best-Value Tradeoff  \n \nFinally, SMS argues that t he agency  failed to perform and inadequately documented its  \nbest-value tradeoff .  The protester argues that the agency should have found Abacus\u2019s \nproposal unacceptable, and but for the misleading discussions, SMS would have been \nawarded the contract.   Protest at 16.  The agency argues that the best -value decision is \nreasonable and, consistent with the FOPR, award to SMS at an approximately $12 million price premium cannot be justified.  MOL at 27- 28. \n As noted, in its final evaluation of proposals, the agency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were technically acceptable with substantial confidence under the past performance factor, and Abacus proposed a lower price.  AR, Tab 120, FODD at 22.  The FOPR stated:  \n \nAll offerors judged to have a \u201cSubstantial Confidence\u201d past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision Authority shall make an integrated assessment award decision to the offeror deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  \n ITO Amend. 1 at 14.  As discussed above, we find no merit to the protester\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Abacus\u2019s price proposal or its argument that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS.  Thus, given the solicitation language,  we \nfind no basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s determination that Abacus presented the \nbest value to the government is unreasonable.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

This version has been \napproved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-423341 et al.  Chase, Maryland, under fair opportunity proposal request (FOPR) No. FA8773- 24-R-\n0002, issued by the Department of the Air Force for intranet control support services to \noperate, manage, and defend the Air Force\u2019s portion of the Department of Defense information network.  The protester argues that various aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation of the offerors\u2019 price proposals was unreasonable, the agency engaged in \nmisleading discussions with SMS, and the best -value decision is flawed.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on May 21, 2024, using the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 16.5, set aside for small business holders of the Department of the Army\u2019s responsive strategic sourcing for services multiple- award \nindefinite -delivery, indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement \n(COS) at 3.  SMS was the incumbent contractor and previously performed the same services sought by this procurement.  The FOPR contemplated issuance of a fixed- price \ntask order with a period of performance to include a 2- month transition period, a 10-\nmonth base period, four 12- month option periods, and a 6- month option to extend.  \nAgency Report (AR), Tab 35, Instruction to Offerors (ITO) Amend. 1 at 9.   \n The FOPR stated that proposals would be evaluated under the following factors:  technical, past performance, and price.  Id.  at 15.  The technical factor would be rated \nas either acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Past performance was to be assessed and \nassigned one of the following confidence ratings:  substantial, satisfactory, neutral, \nlimited or no confidence.  Id. at 18.  Regarding price, the FOPR stated that total \nevaluated price would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced pricing.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR required that offerors submit \nprofessional employee compensation plans and stated they would be evaluated in accordance with FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional \nEmployees.  Id. at 20.   \n The FOPR further stated:   \n \nProposals must be technically acceptable to be awardable.  Past performance is considered more important than Price, and the \nGovernment may choose to trade past performance for price on \ntechnically acceptable proposals. . . .  All offerors judged to have a \n\u201cSubstantial Confidence\u201d past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision \nAuthority shall make an integrated assess ment award decision to the \nofferor deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  \n \nId. at 14.  \n  Page 3 B-423341 et al.  The agency received nine proposals in response to the solicitation, including from SMS \nand Abacus.  COS at 4.  Following the initial evaluation of proposals, the agency elected to engage in technical interchanges with five offerors and subsequently engaged in interchanges with four of those offerors regarding their professional \nemployee compensation plans.  Id.  at 10.  In its final evaluation of proposals, the \nagency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were acceptable under the technical factor and assigned both offerors ratings of substantial confidence under the past \nperformance factor.  AR, Tab 120, Fair Opportunity Decision Document (FODD) at 22.  The agency also concluded that both offerors submitted realistic professional employee compensation plans; SM S\u2019s final proposed price was $128,545,851, and Abacus\u2019s final \nproposed price was $116,202,405.  Id.   \n On February 11, 2025, the contracting officer, who also served as the source selection authority (SSA), awarded the task order to Abacus and provided SMS with a combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  On February 21, SMS filed its protest.\n1 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe gravamen of the protest is that the agency failed to reasonably evaluate Abacus\u2019s \nlower price as presenting a risk to successful contract performance.  The protester also \nargues that because the agency\u2019s discussions led  SMS to increase its price, the award \nto Abacus at a lower price demonstrates  that the agency\u2019s discussions with SMS were \nmisleading.   We address these arguments below.  \n \nTimeliness  \n \nAs an initial matter, the intervenor repeatedly argues that the protest should be \ndismissed in its entirety as premature.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 3- 6; Intervenor \nReply in Support of Req. for Dismissal at 1- 3; Intervenor Comments at 2, 4- 6.  Abacus \nargues that the protest was prematurely filed prior to the conclusion of SMS\u2019s \n\u201cenhanced debriefing\u201d because SMS was awaiting answers to questions submitted to the agency after it received its combined unsuccessful offeror letter and written debriefing.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 5.  The agency concurs with the \nintervenor\u2019s request.  Agency Concurrence with Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 1.  \n As noted, the procurement here was conducted using FAR subpart 16.5 procedures, \nwhich state that \u201c[t]he procedures at [FAR] 15.506 shall be followed when providing \n[post award] debriefing to unsuccessful awardees.\u201d  FAR 16.505(b)(6)(ii).  Section \n15.506 st ates:  \u201c An offeror, upon its written request received by the agency within 3 \ndays after the date on which that offeror has received notification of contract award . . . \n \n1 The awarded value of the task order exceeds $35 million.  Accordingly, this \nprocurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of orders \nunder multiple- award IDIQ contracts awarded under the authority of title 10 of the \nUnited  States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B).

AR, Tab 118, SMS Unsuccessful Offeror Notice and Debriefing.  \n In the unsuccessful offeror notice, the agency stated that \u201cin accordance with [Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)] 215.506- 70 the Government \nprovides each offeror the opportunity to submit additional written questions . . . in writing, no later than Friday, 14 February 2025.\u201d  Id. at 2.  In this regard, DFARS section \n215.506- 70(a) provides procedures for an \u201cenhanced debriefing\u201d and states that \ncontracting officers shall \u201c[p]rovide an opportunity to submit additional questions related to the required debriefing not later than 2 business days after receiving the [post -award] \ndebriefing.\u201d  This same regulation also states that a post -award debriefing is not \nconsidered to be concluded until the later of \u201c(1) the date that the [post -award] \ndebriefing is delivered, orally or in writing; or (2) if additional written questions related to \nthe debriefing are timely received, the date the agency delivers its written response.\u201d  DFARS 215.506- 70(c).  Since the debriefing was provided to SMS on February 11, the \ndue date for submission of additional questions as required by DFARS section 215.506-70 was February 13, not February 14 as stated in the unsuccessful offeror notice.  The protest explained:  \n \nIn SMS\u2019s Unsuccessful Offeror Notice, the Contracting Officer stated that \u201cin accordance with DFARS 215.506- 70 the Government provides each \nofferor the opportunity to submit additional written questions as part of \nan enhanced debriefing.\u201d []  The Contracting Officer requested the \nquestions by February 14, 2025, and SMS submitted questions on this date.  However, February 14, 2025, is three days after SMS received its \n[post award]  debriefing on February 11, 2025, and DFARS 215.506-\n70(a) requires written quest ions to be submitted \u201cnot later than 2 \nbusiness days after receiving the [ post award]  debriefing.\u201d  Therefore, \nwhile SMS did submit written questions for debriefing, in an abundance of caution regarding GAO\u2019s protest deadlines, SMS is filing the current protest.  \n Protest at 2 n.2.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations contain strict rules for the timely submission of protests. These timeliness rules reflect the dual requirements of giving parties a fair opportunity to present their cases and resolving protests expeditiously without unduly dis rupting or \ndelaying the procurement process.  Beckman Coulter, Inc. , B-421748, July 28, 2023, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 180 at 3.  Under these rules, a protest based on other than alleged improprieties in a solicitation must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after the protester knew, or should have known, of the basis for protest, whichever is earlier.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(2).  \n  Page 5 B-423341 et al.  An exception to our general timeliness rule is a protest that challenges \u201ca procurement \nconducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required,\u201d where a protest would be considered timely if f iled \nwithin 10 days after the debriefing.

Exceptional Software \nStrategies, Inc. , B-416232, July 12, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 237 at 5.  Consequently, where \na debriefing is not legally required, a protester that delays the filing of a protest until after that debriefing may be untimely as to any grounds of protest it knew or should have known more than 10 days before filing the protest.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a)(1) -(2); Done \nBy Native, LLC , B-422270, Mar. 29, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 87 at 3.  \n In order to extend its debriefing, section 215.506- 70(a) of the DFARS required the \nprotester to submit questions to the agency no later than two business days after receiving its written debriefing on February 11.  The protester submitted its questions on February 14, one day later than the deadline set by the regulation.  Therefore, because SMS did not timely submit its questions pursuant to DFARS section 215.506- 70(a), the \ndebriefing was considered to be concluded on the date the debriefing was delivered,  \ni.e., February 11.  Under these circumstances, the protest was required to be filed within \n10 days of when the protester knew or should have known its basis of protest and SMS could not wait to file the protest until the agency provided answers to its untimely  \nsubmitted questions.  Accordingly, we conclude that the protest was not premature and was timely filed.\n2 \n Price Evaluation  \n \nThe protester argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus\u2019s proposal \nunder FAR provision 52.222- 46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional \nEmployees .  According to SMS, it proposed rates largely in line with its incumbent rates, \nand the agency failed to recognize that Abacus\u2019s lower total price--10 percent less than the total price proposed by SMS --is clearly unrealistic.  The protester argues that \n \n2 The intervenor also raised several other arguments for dismissal, including SMS\u2019s \nallegation that the agency should have found Abacus unacceptable under the management\/staffing plan subfactor because Abacus\u2019s proposed price was lower than the price propos ed by SMS.  Intervenor Req. for Dismissal at 8.  By itself, the fact that \nAbacus proposed a lower price fails to demonstrate that Abacus\u2019s proposal could not have included an acceptable response to the information required by the solicitation.  Indeed, the FOPR did not require that the agency consider Abacus\u2019s proposed price \nunder the management\/staffing plan subfactor, and the protester provided no other support for its argument that Abacus should have been found unacceptable.  S ee \nProtest at 14- 15.  Allegations that facially do not demonstrate improper agency action \n(e.g., that the agency violated the terms of the solicitation) are legally insufficient.

Electronic Protest Docketing System No.  25; 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.5(f).  \nWe denied the intervenor\u2019s requests to di smiss SMS\u2019s other protest grounds.   Page 6 B-423341 et al.  Abacus will not be able to retain the professional employees required for successful \ncontract performance, and the agency should have rejected its proposal.  Protest at  10-\n13.  The agency argues that its evaluation was fair, reasonable, and consistent with the \nterms of the FOPR and FAR provision 52.222- 46.  Memorandum of Law (MOL) at  10-\n18. \n The purpose of a review of compensation for professional employees is to evaluate each offeror\u2019s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering the realism \nof the proposed professional compensation and its impact upon recruiting and retention.  ENGlobal Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc., B -419612.3, Dec. 15, 2021, 2022 CPD \u00b6 12 at 11.  FAR \nprovision 52.222- 46 requires a two- prong evaluation of professional employee \ncompensation plans.  The first prong is, in effect, a price realism evaluation of proposed compensation, to determine whether an offeror understands the contract requirements and has proposed a compensation plan appropriate for those requirements.  IBSS Corp. , B-422757 et al. , Oct. 24, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 258 at 8.  The second prong \nrequires an agency to determine whether a proposal \u201cenvision[s] compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors\u201d by comparing proposed compensation rates to those of the incumbent.  Guidehouse LLP; Jacobs Tech.

If the agency determines that the awardee\u2019s proposal envisions lower compensation levels compared to the incumbent contractor, then the \nagency must further evaluate the awardee\u2019s proposed compensation plan on the basis of maintaining program continuity, among other considerations.

ITO Amend. 1 at 10- 12.  The FOPR also \nrequired that offerors submit a pricing labor matrix, a template of which was provided with the FOPR as an attachment.  Id.  at 12.  The FOPR stated that the offeror\u2019s price \nproposal would be evaluated for completeness, price reasonableness, and unbalanced \npricing based upon the total evaluated price proposed.  Id.  at 19.  In addition, the FOPR \nstated:  \u201cThe Professional Employee Compensation Plan will be evaluated for realism and is separate from the [total evaluated price] evaluation.\u201d  Id.   \n With respect to the evaluation of the professional employee compensation plans, the FOPR provided:  \n \nThe Government will compare proposed rates to incumbent rates if available.  If necessary (for example, where comparison to incumbent rates is not feasible), the Government may validate the offeror\u2019s  Page 7 B-423341 et al.  supporting data and use a variety of resources and methods to evaluate \nthe realism of the offeror\u2019s Professional Compensation Plan.  This includes, but is not limited to:  comparing prices paid on prior or similar contracts, comparison of proposed pricing from multiple offerors, market data from one or multiple sources (e.g., Watson & Wyatt, Economic Research Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Salary.com, etc.), or a combination of the above.  \nId. at 20.  The FOPR further noted that for proposed compensation that was lower than \nthe incumbent prices, the agency would evaluate the proposed compensation on the basis of \u201cmaintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality work, and \navailability of required competent professional service employees.\u201d  Id.  \n The record shows that the agency reviewed Abacus\u2019s professional employee compensation plan and concluded:  \u201cAbacus\u2019s proposed fringe benefits were considered when evaluating total compensation, and the Government determined they proposed sufficient fringe benefits for recruitment and retention when compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.\u201d  AR, Tab 112, Abacus Evaluation at 25.   The record further shows that the agency computed average \ncompensation rates across all offerors by labor category and used this data along with market data from Economic Research Institute (ERI) and Salary.com to assess the labor category rates proposed by each offeror.  Id.   The agency also compared \nproposed rates to incumbent rates, and explained its evaluation, in pertinent part, as follows:  \n \nThe Government noted any incumbent rates that were significantly lower (more than 4 [percent] ) than market data and the competition average to \nassess the reliability of the incumbent rate for recruitment of new employees and retention of current employees.  The 4 [percent]  measure \nwas judgmentally determined by the Government considering the current employer cost index of 4.1 [percent] , meaning that a difference of more \nthan 4 [percent]  is not readily explained by fluctuations in the labor \nmarket.  For thos e labor categories where the incumbent was significantly \nlower than market and competition, the Government determined it would evaluate proposed rates further against the market and competition data, [in accordance with]  the FOPR and FAR 52.222- 46, to consider the \nimpact of the proposed rate on recruiting and retention, whether the rate is realistic, and to determine the offeror\u2019s ability to provide uninterrupted high- quality work.  . . .  Where the Government found the incumbent rate \nto be reliable, and the offeror\u2019s proposed rate was above the incumbent \ncompensation levels, the proposed rate was determined to be realistic.  \n \n* * * * * \n In many cases the incumbent evaluation rate was well above (between 4 [percent]  and 42 [percent] ) market and competition.  Where the proposed \nrate was below the incumbent rate (envisioning compensation levels  Page 8 B-423341 et al.  lower than the incumbent), the Government evaluated the proposed rate \n\u201con the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high- quality \nwork, and availability of required competent professional service employees \u201d by comparing to the competition average, Salary.com market \ndata, and ERI market data.  Proposed rates higher than 4 [percent]  below \nany of these data points were determined to be realistic.  \n For rates where the incumbent rate was potentially unreliable as described above or where no incumbent rate was available, the Government further evaluated against both market data points and the competitive average.  The Government determined a rate to be \nunrealistic if it was 4  [percent]  or more below all data points, including the \ncompetitive average, Salary.com market data, ERI market data, and the incumbent rate (if available and reliable).  \n Id. at 26- 27.   \n The record shows that two- thirds of Abacus\u2019s proposed rates were higher than the \nincumbent rates; the one- third of Abacus\u2019s rates that fell below the incumbent rates \nwere otherwise higher than at least one of the rates used by the agency for comparison (i.e., average competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  Id. at 28- 29.  The agency \nconcluded that the price proposal submitted by Abacus was complete, reasonable, and balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  Id.  at 30.   \n In contrast, in its evaluation of SMS, the agency identified six labor category rates that \nwere more than four percent below the rates used for comparison; in other words, SMS \nproposed rates below the incumbent rate, or where an incumbent rate was unavailable \nor unreliable, SMS proposed rates more than four percent below the average competition rate, ERI, and Salary.com.  The record does not support the protester\u2019s argument that Abacus\u2019s proposal should have been rejected because of its much lower price.  O n the contrary, the record shows that Abacus\u2019s proposed labor rates were all \nhigher than either the incumbent rates or the other data used by the agency ( i.e., \naverage competition rate, ERI, or Salary.com).  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s conclusion that Abacus\u2019s professional employee compensation plan was realistic and find that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the requirements of FAR provision 52.222- 46.\n3  \n \n3 The protester maintains that the agency\u2019s evaluation is flawed because the agency \ncompared base hourly salary rates rather than fully burdened rates that would include fringe benefits.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 4- 7.  However, as explained by the \nagency, rather than using fully burdened rates, its evaluation utilized incumbent payroll data because this information provided actual employee salary information.  COS at 11-12.  Our Office has previously found that an agency\u2019s use of burdened labor rates in an evaluation under FAR provision 52.222- 46 did not permit meaningful consideration of \nthe compensation to be paid to employees.   See MicroTechnologies, LLC , B-413091,  \n(continued...)   Page 9 B-423341 et al.   \nThe protester also argues that the agency performed a flawed analysis of Abacus\u2019s price under Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) provision 252.204- 7024 \nand would have found Abacus to be unacceptable if it compared Abacus\u2019s rates to historical pri ces paid.  Protest at 13- 14; 2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 7 -8.  SMS \ncontends that under this DFARS clause, the agency was required to evaluate the price risk of Abacus\u2019s total proposed price.  \n The DFARS provision 252.204- 7024 defines price risk as \u201ca measure of whether a \nproposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.\u201d  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(a).  The DFARS mandates that the \nsuppl ier performance risk system (SPRS) be used in the evaluation of an offeror\u2019s \nperformance and requires the contracting officer to \u201c consider SPRS risk assessments \nduring the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows:  . . . (2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is \nconsistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. \u201d  DFARS provision 252.204- 7024(c)(2).  \n The agency argues that it properly evaluated Abacus\u2019s price in accordance with this requirement, and consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  MOL at 18- 22.  The \ncontracting officer explains that SPRS functionality is currently limited to running a search based on a part number or other identification (such as a national item identification number or national stock number).  The contracting officer states that for 100 percent service contracts that are not associated with a part number or product code, the pr ice risk for that particular service is not available.  COS at 22- 23.  The \nrecord includes a declaration from the SPRS program manager, in which he confirms:  \n \nAt present time, if a service contract does not have an associated [Product Service Code (PSC)] or Manufacturer [Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE)] Code with a Part Number or [National Item Identification Number (NIIN)], the SPRS Item\/Price Risk Repo rt search will not be found \nwhich is equivalent to yielding a \u201cnot available\u201d result, indicating there is no performance risk information in SPRS for that particular PSC\/part number combination.  \n AR, Tab 130, Decl. of SPRS Program Manager at 2.   \n \n \nB-413091.2, Aug. 11, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 219 at 8- 14.  Further, as noted, the agency \nalso separately evaluated Abacus\u2019s proposed fringe benefits and determined they were sufficient for recruitment and retention \u201cwhen compared to incumbent fringe benefits offered and industry standards.\u201d  AR, Tab 112, Abacus  Evaluation at 25.  We find this \nexplanation is reasonable and that the evaluation satisfies the FAR requirement to evaluate each offeror\u2019s ability to provide uninterrupted, high- quality work, considering \nthe realism of the proposed professional compensati on and its impact upon recruiting \nand retention.   Page 10 B-423341 et al.  On this record, we find the agency\u2019s explanation of how it used the SPRS reasonable \nand consistent with the requirements of DFARS provision 252.204- 7024.  Accordingly, \nthis allegation is denied.4 \n After review of the initial agency report, the protester additionally contends that the agency failed to perform a proper price reasonableness analysis.  SMS argues that despite Abacus\u2019s lower price, Abacus proposed labor category rates that were well abov e the incumbent rate, and the record fails to document why these rates were found \nto be reasonable.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 3 -4.  The agency argues that this \nallegation fails to state a valid basis of protest because the FOPR did not require a pri ce \nreasonableness assessment of individual labor category rates, and it properly evaluated total evaluated prices for reasonableness, consistent with the terms of the FOPR.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 7 -9. \n We agree with the agency that the solicitation did not require that the agency assess whether individual labor category rates were too high.  As our decisions have stated, the purpose of a price reasonableness review is to determine whether the prices offered are too high, as opposed to too low.  Tetra Tech, Inc. , B-409095, B -409095.2, Jan. 17, \n2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 108 at 7.  The solicitation clearly stated that total evaluated price would be evaluated for price reasonableness.  ITO Amend. 1 at 14, 19.  There w as \nnothing in the solicitation that provided for the agency to analyze individual labor rates for reasonableness.  Accordingly, we dismiss this argument because it fails to state a valid basis of protest.  Eagle Hill Consulting, LLC , supra.  \n \nMisleading Discussions  \n The protester argues that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS because the agency informed SMS that some of its rates were unrealistically low and led SMS to increase its price yet made award to Abacus at a much lower evaluated price.  Pro test at 15.  The agency argues that exchanges were not misleading, and it \nreasonably  identified rates proposed by SMS that were found to be unrealistically low, \nbut did not require that SMS increase them.  The agency avers that SMS elected to \nincrease its price  rather than justify the rates it initially proposed and that SMS\u2019s \ndecision to raise its price fails to demonstrate that  the agency\u2019s exchanges were \nmisleading.   MOL at 22- 25. \n The regulations concerning discussions under FAR part 15, which pertain to negotiated procurements, do not, as a general rule, govern task and delivery order competitions conducted under FAR subpart 16.5, such as the procurement here.

In this regard, FAR \n \n4 The protester also alleged that the agency failed to determine whether Abacus had a \nscore in the SPRS as required by the FOPR and DFARS provision 252.204- 7019 and \nclause 252.204- 7020.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 2- 3.  After review of the \nsupplemental agency report, the protester withdrew this allegation.  Supp. Comments at 1.

In our decisions addressing an agency\u2019s obligations in conducting discussions under FAR part 15, we have stated that an agency may not mislead an offeror through the framing of a discussion question into responding in a manner that does not address the agency\u2019s actual concerns, or otherwise misinform the \nofferor concerning a problem with its proposal.  Refinery Assocs. of Texas, Inc. ,  \nB-410911.2, Mar. 18, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 116 at 6.  \n As discussed, the agency identified six labor category rates that it considered to be unrealistic and issued a notice to SMS.\n5  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation \nInterchange 003 at 2- 3.  That notice stated:  \n \nSMS may choose to revise all or some of the rates at their own discretion or provide adequate justification that the current proposed rates are realistic and meet the criteria in FAR 52.222- 46.  If SMS revises their \nproposal, please utilize an updated complete Professional Compensation Matrix (Attachment 7).  If necessary, the Subcontractors may provide this updated attachment to the Government directly.  The supporting information for the proposed professional compensation information shall be included in the Contractor Response section below.  \n AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.  The record shows that SMS increased its price, and its final proposal was found to be complete, \nreasonable, balanced, and its professional employee compensation plan was realistic.  \nAR, Tab 111, SMS Evaluation at 30.   \n The protester argues that blaming SMS for raising its price is not a fair response.  SMS contends that it had no choice but to raise its price and insists that making award at a lower price is evidence the discussions were misleading because it contradicts  the \ninformation given to SMS during exchanges.  2nd Supp. Protest & Comments at 8- 9.  \nHowever, the protester has not shown that following the price evaluation procedures, as discussed above, the agency\u2019s concerns that the specific rates identified in the notice were incorrect.  And rather than give SMS no choice but to raise its price, the notice \nalternatively afforded SMS the opportunity to provide adequate justification that the initially proposed rates were realistic and met the criteria in FAR provisio n 52.222- 46.  \nThe protester elected to increase its price rather than provide additional justification to substantiate its initial rates.  Thus, the agency did not mislead the protester during discussions and instead properly identified a concern with the protester\u2019s low rates.  In sum, the record does not support the protester\u2019s contention that the agency misled SMS into increasing its labor rates and price.  Accordingly, we deny this allegation.  \n \n \n5 The agency also identified rates proposed by SMS\u2019s subcontractors found to be \nunrealistic.  AR, Tab 99, SMS Professional Compensation Interchange 003 at 3.   Page 12 B-423341 et al.  Best-Value Tradeoff  \n \nFinally, SMS argues that t he agency  failed to perform and inadequately documented its  \nbest-value tradeoff .  The protester argues that the agency should have found Abacus\u2019s \nproposal unacceptable, and but for the misleading discussions, SMS would have been \nawarded the contract.   Protest at 16.  The agency argues that the best -value decision is \nreasonable and, consistent with the FOPR, award to SMS at an approximately $12 million price premium cannot be justified.  MOL at 27- 28. \n As noted, in its final evaluation of proposals, the agency concluded that both SMS and Abacus were technically acceptable with substantial confidence under the past performance factor, and Abacus proposed a lower price.  AR, Tab 120, FODD at 22.  The FOPR stated:  \n \nAll offerors judged to have a \u201cSubstantial Confidence\u201d past performance assessment will be considered equal and contract award will be made to the lowest price offerer whose Professional Compensation Plan is considered realistic.  The Decision Authority shall make an integrated assessment award decision to the offeror deemed as providing the best overall value to the Government.  \n ITO Amend. 1 at 14.  As discussed above, we find no merit to the protester\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of Abacus\u2019s price proposal or its argument that the agency engaged in misleading discussions with SMS.  Thus, given the solicitation language,  we \nfind no basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s determination that Abacus presented the \nbest value to the government is unreasonable.  \n The protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

The protester filed \nthis protest with our Office on April  7. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nDismissal of the Protest as Academic  \n On April 14, the agency requested dismissal of the protest, arguing that the protester is \nnot an interested party; the protest raises procurement integrity matters that are not \nproper protest issues for consideration by our Office; and the protest i s speculative and \nfails to state a detailed basis for protest.  See  Req. for Dismissal at  2-6.  On April  18, the \nintervenor also requested dismissal of the protest, raising arguments largely similar to \nthose advanced by the agency.  See Intervenor Req. for Dismissal .  The protester \nresponded to both of those requests for dismissal, opposing the arguments raised by \nthe agency and intervenor.  See  Resp. to Req. for Dismissal; Resp. to Intervenor Req. \nfor Dismissal.  \n \n1 The protester refers to its submission as an unsolicited proposal, see Protest at  2, \nwhile the agency refers to it as a capability statement, see  Req. for Dismissal at  1.

Page 3 B-423447   \nOn April 22, prior to our Office\u2019s  having the opportunity to decide the previously filed \nrequests for dismissal , the agency notified our Office that it had terminated the order on \nApril 18, and therefore requested that the protest be dismissed as academic .  Notice of \nTermination & Req. for Dismissal at  1.  The protester responded, opposing dismissal on \nthe basis that the termination was a pretext to avoid review of the agency\u2019s actions and \nwas not based on programmatic need, contending that \u201cthe timing of t he contract \ntermination--coming after the protest was filed and after [the agency] reviewed the substance of the allegations --raises a strong inference of bad faith. \u201d  Resp. to Notice of \nTermination & Req. for Dismissal at  1-2. \n The jurisdiction of our Office is established by the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551- 3557.

(Digital Force), of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of Small Business Innovation Research p rogram ( SBIR) phase III sole -source \nsolicitation  No. FA2381- 25-R- B004,  to Clear Align , LLC, of Nashua, New Hampshire, by \nthe Department of the Air Force.  Digital Force contends that the SBIR phase III \nsolicitation  was improper ly issued to Clear Align and that the agency is required to issue \na competitive solicitation for its requirement.    \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small business concerns in federally funded research or research and development (R\/R&D).

This version has been approved for public release without redactions. \n \n  Page 2     B-423319   agency\u2019s  R\/R&D effort is reserved for award to small business concerns.  See generally  \nid.   \n \nThe SBIR program has three phases.  Under phase I, firms competitively apply for an award to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of a concept.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 638(e)(4)(A).  If this is successful, a firm may be invited to appl y for a phase \nII award to further develop the concept.  Id. \u00a7 638(e)(4)(B).  A phase III award is defined \nas work that \u201cderives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 638(e)(4)(C).  Under thi s phase, firms are \nexpected to obtain funding from non- SBIR government sources or the private sector to \ndevelop the concept into a product for sale in private sector or military markets.  \n This protest involves the agency\u2019s requirement for a tactical security system (TSS).  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 2.  Put simply, a TSS is a security and \nsurveillance system.  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, July 2023 Requirements \nDocument at  2.  Specifically, t he agency\u2019s requirement is for an \u201cincrement 1\u201d TSS \nwhich is described as a \u201cmodular, scalable, tailorable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground- based security and surveillance system.\u201d   Id.; AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.    \n The contemplated TSS will provide ground- based tactical security and surveillance \ncapability to assist security forces defenders in protecting personnel and mission assets at remote deployment locations.  AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.  The TSS will provi de \n\u201csite situational awareness\u201d through a network including motion detection, video assessment, and other sensing technologies integrated with command and control capability and connectivity to patrolling defenders.  Id.  Key requirements for the \nincrement  1 TSS involve minimum coverage range, radar coverage, image assessment \nsensors, ability to operate in high winds, and a maximum weight.  COS at  2.   \n By way of background, in September of 2023, the agency sought to procure a different  \nTSS, called increment  0.  COS at 3.  Based on its market research, the agency \ndetermined that Digital Force offered an \u201c increment  0\u201d TSS, and on September 29, \n2023, the agency awarded Digital Force a sole- source contract for the increment  0 TSS.  \nId. at 3-4. \n Also in September of 2023, the agency published a request for information (RFI) for the instant requirement, the increment  1 TSS.  Id. at 4.  Fourteen vendors responded, \nincluding Digital Force and Anduril Industries (Anduril).\n1  Id. at 5.  Clear Align did not \nrespond to this  RFI.  Id.   \n Over the next several months, the Air Force continued its  market research for the \nincrement 1 TSS requirement .  On January  18, 2024, the agency published a second \nRFI on SAM.gov, the governmentwide point of entry  (GPE) .  Id.  Ten  vendors \nresponded, including Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align.  Id.  at 5-8.  Additionally, the \n \n1 As discussed later in this decision, Anduril  (of Costa Mesa, California) is relevant to \nthe procurement history .  Anduril is not a party to this protest.      Page 3     B-423319   agency published the same RFI to the General Services Administration (GSA) website.  \nId. at 7.  Four vendors responded to the RFI posted on GSA\u2019s website, none of which \nwere Digital Force, Anduril, or Clear Align .  Id.  The agency also directly contacted \ninterested vendors via  email to share its systems requirement document (SRD) with \nthose vendors and to solicit responses.  Id.  at 9.  \n Relevant here, the Air Force directly contacted Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align about  the increment 1 TSS requirement and provided them with the agency\u2019s SRD .  Id. \nat 9-11.  Each of these firms responded to the inquiry.  Id.   The agency  also provided \nanother RFI  to 16 small businesses  that had expressed interest in the increment 1 \nacquisition.  Id.  at 11.  Clear Align, a small business concern, received this RFI.  Id.  \nat 11-12. \n Over the course of conducting its market research, the agency learned information which suggested that both Clear Align and Anduril could be eligible to receive an  SBIR \nphase III award for the increment 1 TSS.  Id. at 6, 12.   On August  20, 2024, the agency \ndecided to fulfill the increment 1 TSS requirement via  an SBIR phase  III award , rather \nthan pursuing a competitive procurement such as a competition under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.  Id. at 17.  T he agency then issued two sole- source \nSBIR pha se III solicitations  for the  same increment 1 TSS  requirement ; one to Clear \nAlign and one to Anduril.  Id.    \n On September 3, Digital Force learned that the agency  would pursue its increment 1 \nTSS requirement  via an SBIR phase III award.  Id. at 21.  Ten days later, Digital Force \nfiled an agency -level protest challenging the agency\u2019s decision to pursue an  SBIR \nphase III award  rather than conducting a competition for the TSS requirement .\n2  Id. \nat 22; AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  11-20.   \n \nThe protester argued that the Air Force\u2019s  increment  1 TSS requirement was not eligible \nto be awarded through a sole-source SBIR p hase III solicitation because it did not \nderive from, extend, or complete efforts from a previous SBIR award,  as (according to \nthe protester) the requirement did not include original concepts, findings, ideas, or \nresearch results generated by a previous SBIR effort.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level \nProtest at  14-15.  Further, t he protester claimed  that the agency\u2019s use of SBIR authority \nwas inappropriate because the requirement was for existing capabilities available from Digital Force and the commercial marketplace, and therefore the requirement should be competed.  Id. at 15.  According to Digital Force, SBIR phase III authority was not \nintended to apply to a scenario (like here)  where competing technologies are available \n \n2 Digital Force also argued that the Air Force improperly failed to publish a notification of \nits sole -source justification to the GPE.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  18-19.  \nThe agency denied this protest ground, finding that it was not required  to publish to the \nGPE a justification and approval document for actions related to an  SBIR phase  III \naward.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at  6-7.  This protest ground is not \nincluded in the instant protest and therefore we do not address it further.   Page 4     B-423319   to meet the agency\u2019s need.  Id. at 17.  On September 23, the Air Force denied the \nagency -level protest.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at 7.  \n \nOn October 3, Digital Force filed a protest with our Office, challenging the SBIR phase III solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril for the increment 1 TSS.  COS \nat 23.  In that protest, Digital Force challenged the Air Force\u2019s authority to procure the \nincrement 1 TSS via  an SBIR phase  III award rather than a competitive acquisition.   AR, \nTab 23, First GAO Protest at  18-27.  In response, the Air Force filed a notice of \ncorrective action, stating that the agency would cancel the solicitations issued to Clear \nAlign and Anduril, and issue a new solicitation that \u201cmore clearly addresses competition issues and best meets the needs of the Air Force.\u201d  AR, Tab 26, Notice of Corrective Action at  2.  On November 21, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Digital \nForce Techs., Inc. , B-423029, Nov.  21, 2024 (unpublished decision).  \n As part of its corrective action, the Air Force canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril.  COS at  24.  The Air Force concluded that issuing a single SBIR \nphase III solicitation to Clear Align for the increment 1 TSS would address the identified \ncompetition concerns, as \u201cthere would not be any further confusion associated with the release of simultaneous sole source SBIR Phase III solicitations[.]\u201d   Id. at 25.  On \nDecember 9, the Air Force decided to pursue the increment 1 TSS requirement via  a \nsingle SBIR phase  III solicitation issued to Clear Ali gn.  Id.  On December 20, Clear \nAlign submitted its proposal.  Id.  at 25- 26.   \n On January 22, 2025, Digital Force requested a status update on the corrective action.  AR, Tab 36, Email from Digital Force to Agency, Jan. 22, 2025.  In response, the Air \nForce stated that it had canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril, reassessed its market research, and decided to issue a single SBIR phase III \nsolicitation for the increment 1 TSS requirement.  Id. , Email from Agency to Digital \nForce, Jan. 27, 2025.  The agency subsequently confirmed that the new solicitation had \nbeen issued to Clear Align .  Id., Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 30, 2025.  The \nagency further stated that  Clear Align\u2019s proposed solution derives from, extends, and \ncompletes work from two prior SBIR phase II awards ; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 \nand contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069.   Id.  The record reflects that no award has been \nmade.   AR, Tab 36, Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 27, 2025; Memorandum of \nLaw ( MOL ) at 6.  On February 6, Digital Force filed the instant protest with our Office.  \n DISCUSSION  Digital Force challenges the Air F orce\u2019s issuance of  an SBIR phase  III solicitation  to \nClear Align , arguing that  the agency\u2019s requirement for an increment 1 TSS does not \nderive from, extend, or complete the relevant  SBIR phase  II efforts .  The protester \nfurther argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an SBIR phase III award because the relevant SBIR phase II contracts were awarded to a firm called Computer \nOptics, not Clear Align , and Clear Align does not qualify as a successor -in-interest  entity  \nto Computer Optics .  As relief, Digital Force requests the Air Force rescind the SBIR \nphase III solicitation and issue a competitive solicitation under which Digital Force can  Page 5     B-423319   compete.   The Air Force defends its procurement on all grounds.  As discussed below, \nwe deny the protest.3  \n \nContracting agencies have broad discretion to determine their needs and the best way \nto meet them.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. , B-402530, B -402530.2, May 17, \n2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6  117 at 3.  We have recognized this discretion with respect to the \nSBIR program, and in reviewing the propriety of a phase I or II SBIR award, we have found that our review is limited to determining whether the agency violated any applicable regulations or solicitation provisions or acted in bad faith.  Wang Electro- Opto \nCorp. , B-418523, June 4, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 187 at 5; U S Positioning Grp., LLC , \nB-294027, June 21, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 133 at 3.   \n With respect to SBIR phase III,  the SBIR statute and policy guidance provide relatively \nlimited requirements to justify an award.   The relevant portion of the statute states that \nthe SBIR program will include, \u201cwhere appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program in which commercial applications of SBIR -funded research or research \nand development are funded by non- Federal sources of capital or, for products or \nservices intended for use by the Federal Government, by follow -on non- SBIR Federal \nfunding awards[.]\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7  638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that \u201c[t]o the \ngreatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that  developed the technology.  Id.  \u00a7 (r)(4).    \n The policy directive  defines SBIR phase III work in a similar manner .  SBIR\/Small \nbusiness Technology Transfer (STTR)  Policy Directive ( May 2023)  \u00a7 4(c)  (\u201cPhase III \nrefers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR\/STTR Funding Agreements\u201d).   The policy directive clarifies that a federal agency \nmay enter an  SBIR phase III agreement at any time with an  SBIR phase II awardee and \nexplains that an  SBIR phase III awardee may be a party that  received an  SBIR phase I \nor phase II award, been novated a phase I or phase II award, or is  a \nsuccessor -in-interest entity.  Id. \n Given these limited requirements and the significant discretion afforded to agencies in this area, the core issue s we must resolve are whether the Air Force reasonabl y \nconcluded that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS derives from, extend s, or complet es \nefforts made under prior SBIR awards  and whether Clear Align qualifies as a successor \nin interest entity to Computer Optics, which completed the prior SBIR efforts .  As \ndiscussed below, we deny the protest.  \n \n \n3 Digital Force raises other collateral arguments.  Although our decision does not \naddress each argument raised, we have reviewed them all and find that none provide a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6     B-423319   Eligibility for  an SBIR Phase III Award  \n \nThe protester first contends that the relevant authority requires the agency to define its \nSBIR phase III requirement to derive from, extend, or complete prior SBI R effort s and \nthat here, the Air Force\u2019s requirement as described in the solicitation and market research documents does not derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  Second, Digital Force contends that Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS  is \nineligible for an SBIR phase III award because it allegedly does not derive from, extend, \nor complete a prior SBIR effort .   \n  \n Challenge to the Agency\u2019s Requirement   \n As stated above, the protester argues the agency\u2019s requirement must derive from, \nextend, or complete prior SBIR efforts , and that just because a proposed solution may \nderive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort, that does not mean the requirements qualify for a SBIR phase III acquisition.  Protest at  22-25; Comments at  4.  \nIn this context, the protester  asserts that the solicitation states  general requirements for \nan increment 1 TSS solution that were developed separately from and without reference to prior SBIR efforts.  Protest  at 24.  As a result, Digital Force maintains that the \nrequirements themselves do not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  In other words, Digital Force  contends that the requirement as described by the \nagency --as opposed to the solution proposed by Clear Align--must show that it derives \nfrom, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort.  \n The Air Force disagrees.   As an initial note, the agency does not contest the protester\u2019s \ncontention that its requirement does not derive from a prior SBIR effort.   However, the \nagency  asserts  the protester incorrectly focus es the analysis on the agency\u2019s \nrequirements rather than on the work to be acquired.  COS at  28; MOL at 14.   The Air \nForce argues that the SBIR statute and the SBIR\/STTR policy directive  require SBIR \nphase III awards to be for work  that derives from, extends, or completes  prior SBIR \nefforts, not for requirements  that derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  \nMOL at  14; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  638 (e)(4)(C)  (phase III is \u201cfor work that derives from, \nextends, or completes efforts[.]\u201d ); SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023)  \u00a7 4(c) \n(\u201cPhase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort\u201d).   As \ndiscussed below, we agree with the Air Force.  \n Our analysis begins with the interpretation of the relevant statute.  See Curtin Mar. Corp. , B-417175.2, Mar. 29, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 117 at 9.  In construing the statute, t he \nfirst step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.   PublicRelay , B-421154, \nB-421154.2, Jan.  17, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  23 at  5.  In this regard, we begin with the \nlanguage employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that langu age accurately expresses the legislative purpose.   Id.  If the statutory language is \nclear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.  Id.  Our Office \nlikewise applies the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule of statutory interpretation.  Id. \n  Page 7     B-423319   The SBIR statute explains that the SBIR program includes a phased structure including: \n\u201cwhere appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes \nefforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program .\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that \u201c[t]o the greatest extent practicable, \nFederal agencies . . . shall . . . consider an award under the SBIR program . . . to satisfy \n[relevant competition requirements]; and . . . issue, without further justificat ion, Phase III \nawards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that developed the technology.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 (r)(4).  \n While not a regulation, t he SBIR\/STTR policy directive provides interpretive guidance \nand states in relevant part : \n \n(c) Phase III. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR\/STTR Funding Agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR\/STTR programs.  Phase III \nwork is typically oriented towards C ommercialization of SBIR\/STTR \nresearch or technology, including through further R\/R&D work.    \n \n(1) Phase III work:   Each of the following types of activity \nconstitutes SBIR\/STTR Phase III work:  \n \n(i) Commercial application . . . of SBIR\/STTR funded \nR\/R&D that is financed by non- Federal sources of \ncapital. . . .    \n \n(ii) SBIR\/STTR- derived products or services intended \nfor use by the Federal Government, funded by non-\nSBIR\/STTR sources of Federal funding.    \n \n(iii) Continuation of SBIR\/STTR work, funded by non-SBIR\/STTR sources of Federal funding including R\/R&D.   \n SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) \u00a7 4(c) .  Further, the policy directive states that \n\u201c[p]hase III work may be for products, production, services, R\/R&D, or any such combination.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 4(c)(4).  \n Based on the authority and guidance cited above, we find that SBIR phase III  \nunambiguously refers to  the work to be acquired,  not the agency\u2019s requirement.  Indeed, \nthe statute and the policy directive each expressly use the word \u201cwork\u201d when explaining SBIR phase III ; they do not mention the agency\u2019s requirement.  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 638(e)(4)(C); SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) \u00a7 4(c).  Therefore, we agree \nwith the Air Force\u2019s interpretation of the SBIR phase III authority ; a proper SBIR phase  Page 8     B-423319   III award is for work  that derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .4  \nAccordingly, we deny the protest ground arguing that the Air Force improperly issued an  \nSBIR phase III solicitation to Clear Align because the agency\u2019s requirement  does not \nderive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  Digital Force\u2019s protest ground \nmisapplies  the relevant law and policy directive and therefore does not provide a basis \nto sustain the protest.5  \n \n Challenge to the Work to be Procured:  Clear Align\u2019s Proposed Increment 1 TSS   \n Digital Force argues that the Air Force has not properly determined that  Clear Align\u2019s \nproposed increment 1 TSS in fact derives from, extends, or completes the prior relevant \nSBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32- 38.  First, the protester  \nargues that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS does not qualify for  an SBIR phase III award \nbecause the record does not demonstrate the required link between the prior SBIR efforts and the proposed increment 1 TSS.  Protest at  28-29; Comments at  24-29.  In \nsupport of this argument, t he protester asserts that the Air Force did not  review the prior \nSBIR phase II efforts  to understand what was developed, nor did  the Air Force review \nthe proposed increment 1 TSS to ensure it derived from, extended, or completed those SBIR phase II efforts.  Comments at  21-29.  Second, Digital Force argues that the Air \nForce is improperly using SBIR phase III authority because only a single component of \nthe system to be acquired could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant \nprior SBIR efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  Prior to discussing the \narguments, for context, we provide a brief explanation o f the solicitation and Clear \nAlign\u2019s  proposed increment 1 TSS.   \n \n \n4 We note that Digital Force recognizes this distinction in other areas of its pleadings.  \nSee e.g. , Comments at 21 (\u201cThe Air Force does not dispute that . . . the acquisition must \ninvolve \u2018work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts\u2019\u201d) . \n5 The protester\u2019s focus on the agency\u2019s requirements, as opposed to Clear Align\u2019s work, \nmay be a distinction without a difference.  In this regard, an agency\u2019s requirements are \nnot necessarily irrelevant to the determination of whether a procurement can properly be awarded as a n SBIR phase III.  Indeed, in some cases we have analyzed the \nagency\u2019s requirements in SBIR p hase III  matters .  See, e.g. , Toyon Research \nCorporation, B -409765, Aug. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6  235 ( Toyon) ; PublicRelay , supra.  In \nthose cases, the protester s argued that the agency\u2019s requirements actually required the \naward of SBIR phase III agreements  on sole- source bases to the respective protester , \nand therefore we necessarily focused our analysis on the agency\u2019s requirements.  \nHowever, as explained above, the statute and policy directive clearly state that SBIR phase III refers to the work that will be performed.  Therefore, while an agency\u2019s \nrequirements may be relevant to the analysis of whether a procurement constitutes an  \nSBIR phase III procurement , the requirements themselves do not need to derive from, \nextend, or complete a prior phase I or II effort in order for an agency to properly use SBIR phase III.   Page 9     B-423319   As noted above, the agency issued a solicitation to Clear Align requesting a proposal to \ndeliver the TSS, \u201cwhich shall contain SBIR -derived technology.\u201d  AR, Tab 34, \nSolicitation at 5.  The solicitation instructed Clear Align to submit three volumes.   Id.  As \nrelevant here, the third volume had to contain \u201call information regarding Clear Align\u2019s SBIR- derived technology in its [] -TSS solution.\u201d  Id. at 8.  This volume had to identify the \nSBIR- derived components and relevant SBIR awards, explain how the ident ified \ncomponents derived from the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards, and include any test or production documentation associated with the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards.  Id.  \n In its proposal, Clear Align  stated that it s proposed increment 1 TSS system is called \nthe Mamba.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Clear Align describe d the Mamba \nas a \u201c turnkey \u201d solution meet ing all of the Air Force\u2019s operational and technical \nrequirements  as described in the SRD  and statement of work .  Id.  The Mamba includes \nan image assessment sensor on a pan tilt unit  based on Clear Align\u2019s Z 320 medium \nwave infrared (MWIR) camera.  Id.  According to Clear Align, t he Z 320 MWIR camera \nimplements technology from two prior SBIR efforts, SBIR topic No.  N-01-016 and SBIR \ntopic No.  AF071- 280, resulting in contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. \nFA9453- 08-C0069, respectively .\n6  Id. at 103-104; see also COS at  31. \n Under SBIR topic No. N01 -016, Clear Align developed optical fabrication processes for \ninfrared materials  (specifically , germanium ).  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  104.  \nUnder this topic, optical polishing techniques were developed which enabled accurate polishing of large optical components.  Id.  Clear Align a lso developed optical coating \nremoval processes, and optical coatings with increased optical efficiency and durability.  \nId.   \n Under SBIR topic No. AF071- 280, Clear Align designed a broadband image optic using \na high performance opto- mechanism design to receive information using a multi -band \nsensor.  Id.  at 105.  Under this topic, engineering principles and designs were \ndeveloped to allow smaller and more cost -effective optical systems to be designed and \nbuilt which would maintain imaging performance over a wide temperature range.  Id.  \n Clear Align\u2019s proposal stated  that following its prior SBIR efforts, it continued to invest in \nzoom lens design and fabrication methods to further advance zoom lens technology to create higher -performance infrared zoom cameras.  Id. at 107.  Clear Align explained \nthat its current generation of zoom cameras  are high- definition systems that use small \npixel pitch technology to offer  image clarity and range performance.  Id.  The firm further \nstate d that key design concepts from the prior SBIR efforts have been refined and are \nembedded into its current generation of cameras.  Id. at 107. \n \n \n6 There is no dispute that the prior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics, \nnot Clear Align.  However, for simplicity and because Clear Align was issued the solicitation as a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, our discussion in this \narea references the prior SBIR efforts as completed by Clear Align.    Page 10     B-423319   Digital Force argues  that Clear Align\u2019s proposed TSS solution does not qualify for  an \nSBIR phase III award because it does not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR \neffort  and that the record does not support the Air Force\u2019s  conclusion that an  SBIR \nphase III award is proper .  As previously noted, the Air Force issued the instant SBIR \nphase III solicitation to Clear Align based on two prior SBIR phase II efforts completed \nby a firm called Computer Optics, under a theory that Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Co mputer Optics.  COS at 31 -34.   \n Digital Force argues the record does not support a conclusion that the Air Force reviewed the relevant SBIR phase II efforts before determining that Clear Align\u2019s proposed SBIR phase III increment 1 TSS derived from, extended, or completed those prior SBIR efforts.  Comments at  21-24.  Rather, Digital Force contends that the agency \nsimply accepted--without any scrutiny --Clear Align\u2019s explanation in its proposal that its \nincrement 1 TSS solution derives from, extends, or completes work from its prior SBIR efforts.   \n Digital Force  also argues that the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III to \nacquire a system where only a single component of the system could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant prior SBIR efforts --the Z 320 MWIR camera.  \nProtest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  The protester argues that even if the Z 320 \nMWIR camera qualifies  as deriving from a prior SBIR effort (which it contests) , the Air \nForce cannot properly use SBIR phase III authority to procure its entire TSS s ystem  \nwhere the only component of the system deriving from the SBIR program might be the \nZ 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 32.  \n \nIn raising  this challenge,  Digital Force contends  that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS  is \nnot an  SBIR- derived produc t because it  consists of several  discrete components, many \nof which are commercially available off -the-shelf (COTS) items  available from multiple \nsources , and that the only components provided by  Clear Align itself are the Z 320 \nMWIR camera and an electro- optic camera.  Id.  at 32-33.  For example, Digital Force \nhighlights  Clear Align \u2019s proposed use of  COTS components  in its overall system  \ninclud ing a ruggedized laptop, a ruggedized tablet, radios, cables, ancillary equipment, \nand a lift mast.  Id.  at 33.    \n According to the protester, here, the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III authority to procure work ( i.e., the COTS items included in the TSS) which does not \nderive from, extend, or complete the prior SBIR effort.  Id.  at 34.  As a hypothetical \nexample to illustrate its point, Digital Force argues that under the Air Force\u2019s interpretation of the SBIR statute, a large defense contractor could purchase the rights to Clear Align\u2019s Z 320 MWIR camera, install the camera on a  C-40 aircraft, and win an  \nSBIR phase III award for the Air Force\u2019s C -40 fleet expansion program.  Id. at 36-37 \nn.115.    \n The Air Force defends its procurement.   MOL at 17- 21.  According to the agency, the \nrecord clearly demonstrates that the SBIR phase III solicitation was properly issued to  Page 11     B-423319   Clear Align for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts.  Id. \nat 18.   \n The Air Force notes that the SBIR statue describes the SBIR program as including a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts, but argues that the statute does not \u201cdefine or explain\u201d the meaning of that language.  Id.  \nat 18.  Based on the statutory language, t he Air Force asserts  that procuring agencies \nhave broad discretion to assess how an underlying SBIR effort is \u201cessential to the goal of a SBIR Phase III contract [,]\u201d and that, contrary to the protest ground, nothi ng in the \nrelevant authority suggests that \u201can entire solution or set of requirements must be wholly derived from the underlying effort. \u201d  Id. at 20.  Furthermore, the Air Force argues \nthat the record contains sufficient documentation explaining how Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS was considered and how it was determined that SBIR phase III authority properly  applies to the instant procurement.  Id.  at 21.  As discussed below, we \nfind no basis to sustain the protest.  \n With respect to an  SBIR phase III award, our Office has previously found that to show \none effort derives from, extends, or completes another, \u201cit must be evident that the requirements for the second effort incorporated original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results  that were generated in the first.\u201d  ASRC Federal Data Network \nTechnologies, LLC , B-418765, Aug.  28, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  339 at  6 (citing  Toyon at 16 \nn.15; see also PublicRelay , supra at 9 n.7.   As discussed more below, we find that the \n\u201coriginal concepts, findings, ideas, or research results\u201d language is not , however,  the \nappropriate test for the instant protest given its posture.   That is, here, we are examining \nwhether proposed work derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts; we are \nnot examining whether the agency\u2019s  stated requirement derives from prior SBIR efforts.  \n Relying on the language in Toyon and PublicRelay , Digital Force argues that this \nprocurement does not qualify for  SBIR phase III because the agency\u2019s requirement \ndoes  not incorporate original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were \ngenerated in Clear Align\u2019s prior SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at 23- 27; Comments \nat 30-32.  However, as explained above, SBIR phase III refers to work that derives from, \nextends, or completes efforts performed under prior SBIR phase I or II awards.  An agency\u2019 s requirements are not dispositive as to whether a procurement can utilize  SBIR \nphase III.   \n Moreover, in Toyon and PublicRelay , our Office was analyzing protests arguing that  the \nagency was required to award SBIR phase III agreements to the respective protesters . \nThe protesters  argued that they should have received sole- source awards because the \nagency  sought contractors to perform requirements that the protesters argued were \nderived from the work the protesters had completed under prior SBIR efforts , or that the \nagency was requiring the contractor s to extend or complete the work they had \npreviously done.  Accordingly, our focus was on whether the government \u2019s \nrequirements  were based on work previously done by the protesters .   \n  Page 12     B-423319   In contrast, here,  the agency  is making a sole- source award to Clear Align  for its  \nproposed TSS solution , which is based on work Clear  Align has proposed in order  to \nmeet the agency\u2019s operational requirement .  In this context, t he relevant  question is \nwhether that proposed solution derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed \nunder the relevant  SBIR phase II awards.   Accordingly, we do not agree with the \nprotester  that the litmus test for determining whether this solicitation  is properly issued \nusing SBIR phase III is whether the agency\u2019s requirements incorporate original \nconcepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were generated in prior SBIR phase I \nor II efforts.7   \n In this posture,  and given the broad language used by the SBIR statute and the \nSBIR\/STTR policy directive  to describe SBIR phase III and the lack of  a precise \nexplanation as to what qualifies as work der iving from , extending , or complet ing a prior \nSBIR effort , we will review the record to determine whether the agency reasonably \nconcluded that this procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III in a manner that is \nconsistent with all applicable laws  and regulations.\n8  \n As detailed above, the instant solicitation was issued to Clear Align following several months of market research.  The contracting officer explains that in determining whether \nSBIR phase III authority could be used for the instant procurement, the agency  \nconcluded that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS constituted work deriving from two prior \nSBIR- funded efforts; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. \nFA9453- 08-C-0069.   COS at  28.  As part of this analysis, the agency prepared an SBIR \nphase III determi nation and findings (D&F) , and a commercial item D&F, on Clear \nAlign\u2019s increment 1 TSS.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F; AR, Tab 32 Commercial \nItem D&F.  \n \nIn the SBIR phase III D&F, the agency concluded that Clear Align\u2019s TSS derives from prior SBIR efforts and that Clear Align is therefore eligible for a sole- source contract \n \n7 Moreover, we clarify that the test in Toyon represented one potential approach to \ndetermine whether a procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III when analyzing an \nagency\u2019s requirements .  That is, whether those requirements incorporate original \nconcepts, findings, ideas, or research results.  We think such an approach provides a \nreasonable assessment of whether the agency intends to procure a solution from contractors that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR phase I or II efforts \nbased on a review of the agency\u2019s requirements.  Here, the analysis is focused on whether the agency reasonably concluded that Clear Align\u2019s proposed work --the \nTSS--derived from, extended, or completed efforts performed under prior SBIR awards.  \n8 We note that the SBIR\/STTR policy directive provides three \u201ctypes of activit [ies]\u201d that \nconstitute SBIR phase III work , but no precise explanation.  SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive \n(May 2023) \u00a7\u00a7 4(c)(1)(i)- (iii).  For example, the policy directive lists as a type of activity \nconstituting SBIR\/STTR phase III work, \u201cSBIR\/STTR- derived products or services \nintended for  use by the Federal Government, funded by non- SBIR\/STTR sources of \nFederal funding.\u201d Id.  \u00a7 (4)(c)(1)(ii).

AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  4; see 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7  638(r)(4)  (stating that to the greatest extent practicable, federal agencies shall \nissue, without further justification, phase III awards relating to technology, including \nsole-source awards, to the SBIR award recipient that developed the technology).   \nIncluded as attachments in the SBIR phase III D&F a re copies of the prior SBIR efforts \nperformed by Computer Optics , the firm subsequently acquired by Clear Align .  AR, \nTab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 \n(contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404).          \n The SBIR phase III D&F memorialized the agency\u2019s consideration of the relevant SBIR phase II efforts and explained their relevance to the instant procurement.  Id. at 2-4.  \nFirst, the D&F explained that work performed under contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069 \nfacilitated the development of engineering principles and designs that enabled a smaller and more cost -effective Z 320 MWIR camera system that will be provided in Clear \nAlign\u2019s TSS.  Id.  at 2-3, 220.   Second, the D&F explained that contract \nNo. N68335- 02-C-0404 resulted in three developments which were incorporated into \nClear Align\u2019s TSS:  accurate polishing of infrared materials, enhanced durability of optical anti -reflection infrared coatings, and optical fabrication of infrared components \nwith challenging geometries and high levels of curvature.   Id. at 4.  The agency \nultimately concluded that Clear Align\u2019s proposed TSS \u201cdirectly benefits from the work performed under the two SBIR Phase II awards\u201d because those prior SBIR efforts \u201cenhanced the performance, manufacturability, and environmental res istance of the \nZ 320 MWIR camera[.]\u201d  Id.  \n In the commercial item D&F, the agency determined that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS \nmet the definition of a commercial product with minor modifications.  AR, Tab 32, Commercial Item D&F at  2.  In reaching this conclusion, the agency found that Clear \nAlign \u2019s TSS was assigned commercial part number VZ320HD -3000, the TSS included \nClear Align\u2019s Z 320 MWIR camera,  which has been commercialized since 2023, the \nZ 320 MWIR camera used for the TSS included a minor modification to meet size and \nweight requirements established in the agency\u2019s SRD, and that the minor modification did not alter the essential characteristics of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Id. at 2-3.  The \nagency found that the SBIR -derived component of the TSS, the Z 320 MWIR camera, \naccounted for 32 percent of the total cost per TSS unit, and that the TSS included other major components that are COTS items.  Id.  at 3-4. \n As discussed above, Digital Force argues that the Air Force unreasonably concluded (and insufficiently documented its conclusion)  that Clear Align\u2019s solution qualified for  an \nSBIR phase III  award.   The protester also argues  that the agency is improperly using \nSBIR phase III authority to acquire a system largely composed of COTS components \nwhere only a single component of the system , the Z 320 MWIR camera,  could have \npossibly derive d from, extended, or completed  the relevant prior SBIR efforts .  Protest \nat 27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32-38.  We have reviewed these challenges and find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.   Based on our review of the record, we decline to disturb \nthe Air Force\u2019s conclusion that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS derives from, extends, or  Page 14     B-423319   completes prior SBIR efforts.  The record shows that the agency reasonably concluded \nClear Align\u2019s proposed solution derives from work developed under prior SBIR efforts.    \n \nContrary to Digital Force\u2019s arguments, t he record includes  sufficient evidence and \nsupport showing how the  Air Force reached its conclusion that the proposed increment \n1 TSS derived from a prior SBIR effort.  This includes  copies of the prior SBIR \ncontracts , which list the details of the work to be completed under those contracts, a \ncopy of the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS, a copy of Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS, an explanation of the SBIR -derived technology in Clear \nAlign\u2019s  proposed solution, and D&F documents evaluating the proposed increment 1 \nTSS against the prior SBIR efforts.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at 1- 4 \n(analysis),  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 (contract \nNo. N68335- 02-C-0404); AR, Tab 34, Solicitation; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal.    \n As previously discussed, the SBIR statute and policy directive set forth very limited requirements to justify a n SBIR phase III solicitation or award.  The record here contains \nample documentation and evidentiary support showing how the Air Force reasonably concluded that Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS derives from the relevant prior \nSBIR phase  II contracts.   \n To the extent that Digital Force criticizes the agency\u2019s review of the prior SBIR phase II efforts or its review of Clear Align\u2019s proposal, we find that such criticism amounts to disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgments which does not provide a basis to sustain this protest.   See MiMoCloud , B-419482, Mar.  25, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  157 at  7.  While \nthe protester may wish the agency had done more independent research or analysis by \ngoing outside of the contents of Clear Align\u2019s proposal in some way, the protester cites no authority requiring such an effort.\n9     \n In addition, we find no basis to sustain the protester\u2019s argument that the agency is improperly using SBIR phase III to procure a system that is made up of COTS components and only a single component could qualify for  an SBIR phase III  award.  In \nthis regard, Digital Force points to no statue, regulation, or other legal authority stating that an agency may not use SBIR phase III authority to procure a system where only a \ncomponent of the overall system derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .  Here, the agency is procuring a security system that requires, for example, \nsurveillance capability, motion detection, video assessment, and sensing technologies, and Clear Align is providing within its overall system, an  SBIR- derived camera.  AR, \nTab 34, Solicitation at  39; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Thus, the \nSBIR- derived component is reasonably related to the overall objective of the system the \nagency seeks to procure.  Accordingly, this procurement is not similar to Digital Force\u2019s hypot hetical example and cautionary tale involving the Air Force\u2019s C -40 fleet expansion \nprogram .   \n \n9 For example, Digital Force opines that the Air Force could have produced evidence \nthat engineers \u201cperformed a technical analysis\u201d of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 26.   Page 15     B-423319    \nIn sum, there simply is no requirement in statute or the policy directive that the entirety \nof a phase III solution must be derived from prior SBIR efforts.   As such , we find that the \nAir Force reasonably concluded Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS derived from the relevant SBIR phase II efforts, and that the record sufficiently supports the agency\u2019s conclusion.   This protest ground is denied.  \n SBIR Phase III Successor -in-Interest Entities  \n Digital Force argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an  SBIR phase III contract \nbecause Clear Align is not a proper successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, the \nfirm that completed the prior  SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  20 n.61; Comments \nat 16-21.  In this regard, Digital Force argues that Clear  Align does not meet the \ndefinition of a successor -in-interest entity , as defined by the SBIR\/STTR policy directive.  \nComments at  19-21.  Digital Force alleges that the record does not support a conclusion \nthat Clear Align acquired Computer Optics and that Clear Align\u2019s proposal misrepresents the merger of the relevant companies.  Id. at 16-18.  As discussed below, \nwe deny the protest.\n10  \n Relevant here, t he SBIR statue includes the following language:  \n \nIn general.  In the case of a small business concern that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR program, a Federal agency m ay enter into a Phase III agreement with that business concern \nfor additional work to be performed during or after the Phase II period.  \n \n* * * * * \n To the greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients  that \ndeveloped the technology.  \n \n \n10 Digital Force also challenges the agency\u2019s reliance on the SBIR\/STTR policy \ndirective\u2019s guidance for successor -in-interest firms.  Comments at 18 -19.  According to \nthe protester, the SBIR\/STTR policy directive conflicts with the SBIR statute, which, accor ding to the protester, does not contemplate SBIR phase III awards to any business \nconcern other than the concern that completed the prior SBIR effort.  Id. (citing \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7  638(r)(1)) ; see SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) \u00a7 6(a)(5) .  We \ndismiss this protest ground as untimely.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(2).  In the protest , Digital \nForce recognized t he relevance of  Clear Align \u2019s status as a successor -in-interest  entity  \nto Computer Optics  but did not  challenge the SBIR\/STTR policy directive\u2019s guidance on \nsuccess- in-interest firms as inconsistent with the SBIR statut e.  Protest at 20 n.61.  \nBecause the challenge appear s for the first time in Digital Force\u2019s comments on the \nagency report, it is untimely.   4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(2).   Page 16     B-423319   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  638(r)(1), (4).  \n \nIn implementing the SBIR statute, the SBIR\/STTR policy directive explains that:  \n \nAn SBIR\/STTR Awardee may include, and SBIR\/STTR work may be performed by, those identified via a \u201cnovated\u201d or \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d or similarly -revised Funding Agreement.  For example, a Phase III Awardee \nmay have either received a prior Phase I or Phas e II award or been \nnovated a Phase I or Phase II award (or received a revised Phase I or Phase II award if a grant or cooperative grant) or be a successor -in-interest entity.  \n SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) \u00a7  6(a)(5).\n11   \n As previously  discussed, the agency determined that Clear Align\u2019s proposed \nincrement  1 TSS included  work deriv ing from two prior SBIR efforts .  See AR, Tab 35, \nClear Align Proposal at  103-104; see also COS at  31.  There is no dispute that these \nprior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics.  See AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase \nIII D&F at  165 ( showing contract No. FA9453- 08-C-0069 issued to Computer Optics ); \nId. at 221 ( showing contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 issued to Computer Optics ).  \nAccordingly, the question we must answer is whether Clear Align properly qualifies as an eligible  SBIR phase III awardee on the theory that it is a successor -in-interest entity \nto Computer Optics.   \n Clear Align\u2019s proposal explained that Clear Align acquired the assets of Computer \nOptics on March 26, 2013.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  The proposal \nstate d that all \u201cintellectual property including, without limitation, patents, computer \nsoftware, data, trademarks, trade secrets, know -how, processes, formulae, designs, \ndrawings, and technical data were assigned to Clear Align, LLC at the closing of the sale.\u201d   Id.  Included as an attachment to the proposal wa s an excerpt of the asset \npurchase agreement entered into between Clear Align and Computer Optics.\n12  Id. \nat 109-110. \n \n \n11 When the SBA updated this language regarding a successor -in-interest , it stated that \n\u201c[a]n entity may be considered a successor -in-interest, if it has secured the transfer of: \n(1) All the small business concern\u2019s assets; or (2) the entire portion of the assets involved in performing the award.\u201d  Small Business Innovation Research Program and \nSmall Business Technology Transfer Program Policy Directive, 85 Fed. Reg. 50062, 50063 (Aug., 17, 2020) .  However, we note that this language does not appear in the \ncurrent version of the SBIR\/STTR policy directive.   In fact, the SBIR\/STTR policy \ndirective does not provide a definition of, or any examples of what qualifies as, a successor -in-interest entity.  See SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) \u00a7  6(a)(5).    \n12 A full copy of the asset purchase agreement is included as part of the record.  AR, \nTab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216.

The Air Force also recognized the relevant SBIR \nphase II awards were performed by Computer Optics.  Id. at 2-3.  Based on its review of \nthe above referenced asset purchase agreement, the Air Force concluded that Clear Align was properly considered a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics  \nbecause Clear Align had acquired the assets of Computer Optics, to include all of \nComputer Optics\u2019 intellectual property , and that Clear Align was eligible for an  SBIR \nphase III award based on the prior SBIR efforts completed by Computer Optics.  Id.  \nat 2-4. \n Digital Force challenges the agency\u2019s conclusion that Clear Align is an eligible SBIR phase III awardee under a successor -in-interest theory.  Comments at 16- 21.  The \nprotester raises multiple challenges in this regard but the gravamen is that Clear Align\u2019s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the record do not sufficiently establish that Clear Align acquired Computer Optics or the relevant SBIR phase II awards.  See id.   For example, Digital Force argues that Computer Optics still exists as \na discrete business concern and therefore Clear Align could not have acquired Computer Optics .  Id. at 17.  As another exam ple, Digital Force contends that the asset \npurchase agreement does not clearly define what intellectual property was conveyed \nfrom Computer Optics to Clear Align in the 2013 transaction because the agreement \nstated that Clear Align acquired intellectual property used in connection with \u201cthe Business\u201d but did not specify which business .  Id.  \n  Page 18     B-423319   The Air Force argues that the record supports its conclusion that Clear Align is a \nsuccessor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of SBIR phase III \neligibility.  Supp. COS at  2-4.  The agency argues that the record shows Computer \nOptics \u201cn o longer exists as a separate entity, but began operating as a division under \nClear Align upon completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement. \u201d  Id. at 3.  The agency \nfurther argues that Clear Align acquired substantially all of Computer Optics\u2019 assets relatin g to \u201cthe Business ,\u201d which include d all of Computer Optics\u2019 intellectual property.  \nId. at 3-4.  The agency maintains that it properly reviewed and relied upon the asset \npurchase agreement  executed between Clear Align and Computer Optics, and \nreasonably concluded that based on that agreement, Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of the instant SBIR \nphase III solicitation.  Id. at 4.  \n Based on our review of the record, we agree with the Air Force.  We find no basis to question the agency\u2019s conclusion that Clear Align is a proper successor -in-interest entity \nto Computer Optics.  Here, the agency reasonably relied on Clear Align\u2019s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the proposal to find that Clear Align had \nacquired Computer Optics .  The proposal states that Clear Align acquired Computer \nOptics on March 26, 2013, and that as part of this acquisition, Clear Align acquired all of Computer Optics\u2019 intellectual property.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  This \nassertion is supported by the contents of the asset purchase agreement.  See id. \nat 109-110; see also AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216 (complete copy of the \nasset purchase agreement).   \n While Digital Force disagrees that the agency properly recognized Clear Align as a \nsuccessor -in-interest  entity , it has not demonstrated that the agency acted \nunreasonably.  Other than challenging the legal sufficiency of the asset purchase \nagreement, Digital Force provides no support for its contention that Computer Optics \nstill exists as a discrete business concern or why this would disqualify Clear Align as a successor -in-interest even if it did.   See e.g. , Comments at  17, 20; Resp. to Supp. \nBriefing at  5-7.   \n To the extent Digital Force contends that the asset purchase agreement did not specify from which business or intellectual property would be acquired, the protester attempts to \nintroduce ambiguity where there is none.

Given that the asset agreement defined only one \n\u201cBusiness,\u201d we have no reason to believe that  \u201call intellectual property\u201d did not include \nComputer Optic\u2019s intellectual property resulting from the prior SBIR efforts.  \n In sum, in  accordance with the SBIR\/STTR policy directive, we find that the Air Force \nproperly issued the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS to Clear Align as  Page 19     B-423319   the successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics.

(Digital Force), of San Diego, California, protests the issuance of Small Business Innovation Research p rogram ( SBIR) phase III sole -source \nsolicitation  No. FA2381- 25-R- B004,  to Clear Align , LLC, of Nashua, New Hampshire, by \nthe Department of the Air Force.  Digital Force contends that the SBIR phase III \nsolicitation  was improper ly issued to Clear Align and that the agency is required to issue \na competitive solicitation for its requirement.    \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small business concerns in federally funded research or research and development (R\/R&D).  See  SBIR \nProgram Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 638 (the \u201cSBIR statute\u201d).  Pursuant to this authority, \ncertain federal agencies are required to provide a program under which a portion of the DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release without redactions. \n \n  Page 2     B-423319   agency\u2019s  R\/R&D effort is reserved for award to small business concerns.  See generally  \nid.   \n \nThe SBIR program has three phases.  Under phase I, firms competitively apply for an award to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of a concept.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 638(e)(4)(A).  If this is successful, a firm may be invited to appl y for a phase \nII award to further develop the concept.  Id. \u00a7 638(e)(4)(B).  A phase III award is defined \nas work that \u201cderives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 638(e)(4)(C).  Under thi s phase, firms are \nexpected to obtain funding from non- SBIR government sources or the private sector to \ndevelop the concept into a product for sale in private sector or military markets.  \n This protest involves the agency\u2019s requirement for a tactical security system (TSS).  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement (COS) at 2.  Put simply, a TSS is a security and \nsurveillance system.  See Agency Report (AR), Tab 3, July 2023 Requirements \nDocument at  2.  Specifically, t he agency\u2019s requirement is for an \u201cincrement 1\u201d TSS \nwhich is described as a \u201cmodular, scalable, tailorable, lightweight, rapidly deployable, ground- based security and surveillance system.\u201d   Id.; AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.    \n The contemplated TSS will provide ground- based tactical security and surveillance \ncapability to assist security forces defenders in protecting personnel and mission assets at remote deployment locations.  AR, Tab 34, Solicitation at 39.  The TSS will provi de \n\u201csite situational awareness\u201d through a network including motion detection, video assessment, and other sensing technologies integrated with command and control capability and connectivity to patrolling defenders.  Id.  Key requirements for the \nincrement  1 TSS involve minimum coverage range, radar coverage, image assessment \nsensors, ability to operate in high winds, and a maximum weight.  COS at  2.   \n By way of background, in September of 2023, the agency sought to procure a different  \nTSS, called increment  0.  COS at 3.  Based on its market research, the agency \ndetermined that Digital Force offered an \u201c increment  0\u201d TSS, and on September 29, \n2023, the agency awarded Digital Force a sole- source contract for the increment  0 TSS.  \nId. at 3-4. \n Also in September of 2023, the agency published a request for information (RFI) for the instant requirement, the increment  1 TSS.  Id. at 4.  Fourteen vendors responded, \nincluding Digital Force and Anduril Industries (Anduril).\n1  Id. at 5.  Clear Align did not \nrespond to this  RFI.  Id.   \n Over the next several months, the Air Force continued its  market research for the \nincrement 1 TSS requirement .  On January  18, 2024, the agency published a second \nRFI on SAM.gov, the governmentwide point of entry  (GPE) .  Id.  Ten  vendors \nresponded, including Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align.  Id.  at 5-8.  Additionally, the \n \n1 As discussed later in this decision, Anduril  (of Costa Mesa, California) is relevant to \nthe procurement history .  Anduril is not a party to this protest.      Page 3     B-423319   agency published the same RFI to the General Services Administration (GSA) website.  \nId. at 7.  Four vendors responded to the RFI posted on GSA\u2019s website, none of which \nwere Digital Force, Anduril, or Clear Align .  Id.  The agency also directly contacted \ninterested vendors via  email to share its systems requirement document (SRD) with \nthose vendors and to solicit responses.  Id.  at 9.  \n Relevant here, the Air Force directly contacted Digital Force, Anduril, and Clear Align about  the increment 1 TSS requirement and provided them with the agency\u2019s SRD .  Id. \nat 9-11.  Each of these firms responded to the inquiry.  Id.   The agency  also provided \nanother RFI  to 16 small businesses  that had expressed interest in the increment 1 \nacquisition.  Id.  at 11.  Clear Align, a small business concern, received this RFI.  Id.  \nat 11-12. \n Over the course of conducting its market research, the agency learned information which suggested that both Clear Align and Anduril could be eligible to receive an  SBIR \nphase III award for the increment 1 TSS.  Id. at 6, 12.   On August  20, 2024, the agency \ndecided to fulfill the increment 1 TSS requirement via  an SBIR phase  III award , rather \nthan pursuing a competitive procurement such as a competition under Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.  Id. at 17.  T he agency then issued two sole- source \nSBIR pha se III solicitations  for the  same increment 1 TSS  requirement ; one to Clear \nAlign and one to Anduril.  Id.    \n On September 3, Digital Force learned that the agency  would pursue its increment 1 \nTSS requirement  via an SBIR phase III award.  Id. at 21.  Ten days later, Digital Force \nfiled an agency -level protest challenging the agency\u2019s decision to pursue an  SBIR \nphase III award  rather than conducting a competition for the TSS requirement .\n2  Id. \nat 22; AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  11-20.   \n \nThe protester argued that the Air Force\u2019s  increment  1 TSS requirement was not eligible \nto be awarded through a sole-source SBIR p hase III solicitation because it did not \nderive from, extend, or complete efforts from a previous SBIR award,  as (according to \nthe protester) the requirement did not include original concepts, findings, ideas, or \nresearch results generated by a previous SBIR effort.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level \nProtest at  14-15.  Further, t he protester claimed  that the agency\u2019s use of SBIR authority \nwas inappropriate because the requirement was for existing capabilities available from Digital Force and the commercial marketplace, and therefore the requirement should be competed.  Id. at 15.  According to Digital Force, SBIR phase III authority was not \nintended to apply to a scenario (like here)  where competing technologies are available \n \n2 Digital Force also argued that the Air Force improperly failed to publish a notification of \nits sole -source justification to the GPE.  AR, Tab 21, Agency -Level Protest at  18-19.  \nThe agency denied this protest ground, finding that it was not required  to publish to the \nGPE a justification and approval document for actions related to an  SBIR phase  III \naward.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at  6-7.  This protest ground is not \nincluded in the instant protest and therefore we do not address it further.   Page 4     B-423319   to meet the agency\u2019s need.  Id. at 17.  On September 23, the Air Force denied the \nagency -level protest.  AR, Tab 22, Agency -Level Protest Decision at 7.  \n \nOn October 3, Digital Force filed a protest with our Office, challenging the SBIR phase III solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril for the increment 1 TSS.  COS \nat 23.  In that protest, Digital Force challenged the Air Force\u2019s authority to procure the \nincrement 1 TSS via  an SBIR phase  III award rather than a competitive acquisition.   AR, \nTab 23, First GAO Protest at  18-27.  In response, the Air Force filed a notice of \ncorrective action, stating that the agency would cancel the solicitations issued to Clear \nAlign and Anduril, and issue a new solicitation that \u201cmore clearly addresses competition issues and best meets the needs of the Air Force.\u201d  AR, Tab 26, Notice of Corrective Action at  2.  On November 21, our Office dismissed the protest as academic.  Digital \nForce Techs., Inc. , B-423029, Nov.  21, 2024 (unpublished decision).  \n As part of its corrective action, the Air Force canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril.  COS at  24.  The Air Force concluded that issuing a single SBIR \nphase III solicitation to Clear Align for the increment 1 TSS would address the identified \ncompetition concerns, as \u201cthere would not be any further confusion associated with the release of simultaneous sole source SBIR Phase III solicitations[.]\u201d   Id. at 25.  On \nDecember 9, the Air Force decided to pursue the increment 1 TSS requirement via  a \nsingle SBIR phase  III solicitation issued to Clear Ali gn.  Id.  On December 20, Clear \nAlign submitted its proposal.  Id.  at 25- 26.   \n On January 22, 2025, Digital Force requested a status update on the corrective action.  AR, Tab 36, Email from Digital Force to Agency, Jan. 22, 2025.  In response, the Air \nForce stated that it had canceled the solicitations issued to Clear Align and Anduril, reassessed its market research, and decided to issue a single SBIR phase III \nsolicitation for the increment 1 TSS requirement.  Id. , Email from Agency to Digital \nForce, Jan. 27, 2025.  The agency subsequently confirmed that the new solicitation had \nbeen issued to Clear Align .  Id., Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 30, 2025.  The \nagency further stated that  Clear Align\u2019s proposed solution derives from, extends, and \ncompletes work from two prior SBIR phase II awards ; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 \nand contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069.   Id.  The record reflects that no award has been \nmade.   AR, Tab 36, Email from Agency to Digital Force, Jan. 27, 2025; Memorandum of \nLaw ( MOL ) at 6.  On February 6, Digital Force filed the instant protest with our Office.  \n DISCUSSION  Digital Force challenges the Air F orce\u2019s issuance of  an SBIR phase  III solicitation  to \nClear Align , arguing that  the agency\u2019s requirement for an increment 1 TSS does not \nderive from, extend, or complete the relevant  SBIR phase  II efforts .  The protester \nfurther argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an SBIR phase III award because the relevant SBIR phase II contracts were awarded to a firm called Computer \nOptics, not Clear Align , and Clear Align does not qualify as a successor -in-interest  entity  \nto Computer Optics .  As relief, Digital Force requests the Air Force rescind the SBIR \nphase III solicitation and issue a competitive solicitation under which Digital Force can  Page 5     B-423319   compete.   The Air Force defends its procurement on all grounds.  As discussed below, \nwe deny the protest.3  \n \nContracting agencies have broad discretion to determine their needs and the best way \nto meet them.  Crewzers Fire Crew Transport, Inc. , B-402530, B -402530.2, May 17, \n2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6  117 at 3.  We have recognized this discretion with respect to the \nSBIR program, and in reviewing the propriety of a phase I or II SBIR award, we have found that our review is limited to determining whether the agency violated any applicable regulations or solicitation provisions or acted in bad faith.  Wang Electro- Opto \nCorp. , B-418523, June 4, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6 187 at 5; U S Positioning Grp., LLC , \nB-294027, June 21, 2004, 2004 CPD \u00b6 133 at 3.   \n With respect to SBIR phase III,  the SBIR statute and policy guidance provide relatively \nlimited requirements to justify an award.   The relevant portion of the statute states that \nthe SBIR program will include, \u201cwhere appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program in which commercial applications of SBIR -funded research or research \nand development are funded by non- Federal sources of capital or, for products or \nservices intended for use by the Federal Government, by follow -on non- SBIR Federal \nfunding awards[.]\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7  638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that \u201c[t]o the \ngreatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that  developed the technology.  Id.  \u00a7 (r)(4).    \n The policy directive  defines SBIR phase III work in a similar manner .  SBIR\/Small \nbusiness Technology Transfer (STTR)  Policy Directive ( May 2023)  \u00a7 4(c)  (\u201cPhase III \nrefers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR\/STTR Funding Agreements\u201d).   The policy directive clarifies that a federal agency \nmay enter an  SBIR phase III agreement at any time with an  SBIR phase II awardee and \nexplains that an  SBIR phase III awardee may be a party that  received an  SBIR phase I \nor phase II award, been novated a phase I or phase II award, or is  a \nsuccessor -in-interest entity.  Id. \n Given these limited requirements and the significant discretion afforded to agencies in this area, the core issue s we must resolve are whether the Air Force reasonabl y \nconcluded that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS derives from, extend s, or complet es \nefforts made under prior SBIR awards  and whether Clear Align qualifies as a successor \nin interest entity to Computer Optics, which completed the prior SBIR efforts .  As \ndiscussed below, we deny the protest.  \n \n \n3 Digital Force raises other collateral arguments.  Although our decision does not \naddress each argument raised, we have reviewed them all and find that none provide a basis to sustain the protest.   Page 6     B-423319   Eligibility for  an SBIR Phase III Award  \n \nThe protester first contends that the relevant authority requires the agency to define its \nSBIR phase III requirement to derive from, extend, or complete prior SBI R effort s and \nthat here, the Air Force\u2019s requirement as described in the solicitation and market research documents does not derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  Second, Digital Force contends that Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS  is \nineligible for an SBIR phase III award because it allegedly does not derive from, extend, \nor complete a prior SBIR effort .   \n  \n Challenge to the Agency\u2019s Requirement   \n As stated above, the protester argues the agency\u2019s requirement must derive from, \nextend, or complete prior SBIR efforts , and that just because a proposed solution may \nderive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort, that does not mean the requirements qualify for a SBIR phase III acquisition.  Protest at  22-25; Comments at  4.  \nIn this context, the protester  asserts that the solicitation states  general requirements for \nan increment 1 TSS solution that were developed separately from and without reference to prior SBIR efforts.  Protest  at 24.  As a result, Digital Force maintains that the \nrequirements themselves do not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  In other words, Digital Force  contends that the requirement as described by the \nagency --as opposed to the solution proposed by Clear Align--must show that it derives \nfrom, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort.  \n The Air Force disagrees.   As an initial note, the agency does not contest the protester\u2019s \ncontention that its requirement does not derive from a prior SBIR effort.   However, the \nagency  asserts  the protester incorrectly focus es the analysis on the agency\u2019s \nrequirements rather than on the work to be acquired.  COS at  28; MOL at 14.   The Air \nForce argues that the SBIR statute and the SBIR\/STTR policy directive  require SBIR \nphase III awards to be for work  that derives from, extends, or completes  prior SBIR \nefforts, not for requirements  that derive from, extend, or complete prior SBIR efforts.  \nMOL at  14; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  638 (e)(4)(C)  (phase III is \u201cfor work that derives from, \nextends, or completes efforts[.]\u201d ); SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023)  \u00a7 4(c) \n(\u201cPhase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort\u201d).   As \ndiscussed below, we agree with the Air Force.  \n Our analysis begins with the interpretation of the relevant statute.  See Curtin Mar. Corp. , B-417175.2, Mar. 29, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 117 at 9.  In construing the statute, t he \nfirst step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.   PublicRelay , B-421154, \nB-421154.2, Jan.  17, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6  23 at  5.  In this regard, we begin with the \nlanguage employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that langu age accurately expresses the legislative purpose.   Id.  If the statutory language is \nclear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.  Id.  Our Office \nlikewise applies the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule of statutory interpretation.  Id. \n  Page 7     B-423319   The SBIR statute explains that the SBIR program includes a phased structure including: \n\u201cwhere appropriate, a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes \nefforts made under prior funding agreements under the SBIR program .\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 638(e)(4)(C).   The statute further states that \u201c[t]o the greatest extent practicable, \nFederal agencies . . . shall . . . consider an award under the SBIR program . . . to satisfy \n[relevant competition requirements]; and . . . issue, without further justificat ion, Phase III \nawards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR . . . award recipients that developed the technology.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 (r)(4).  \n While not a regulation, t he SBIR\/STTR policy directive provides interpretive guidance \nand states in relevant part : \n \n(c) Phase III. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR\/STTR Funding Agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR\/STTR programs.  Phase III \nwork is typically oriented towards C ommercialization of SBIR\/STTR \nresearch or technology, including through further R\/R&D work.    \n \n(1) Phase III work:   Each of the following types of activity \nconstitutes SBIR\/STTR Phase III work:  \n \n(i) Commercial application . . . of SBIR\/STTR funded \nR\/R&D that is financed by non- Federal sources of \ncapital. . . .    \n \n(ii) SBIR\/STTR- derived products or services intended \nfor use by the Federal Government, funded by non-\nSBIR\/STTR sources of Federal funding.    \n \n(iii) Continuation of SBIR\/STTR work, funded by non-SBIR\/STTR sources of Federal funding including R\/R&D.   \n SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) \u00a7 4(c) .  Further, the policy directive states that \n\u201c[p]hase III work may be for products, production, services, R\/R&D, or any such combination.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 4(c)(4).  \n Based on the authority and guidance cited above, we find that SBIR phase III  \nunambiguously refers to  the work to be acquired,  not the agency\u2019s requirement.  Indeed, \nthe statute and the policy directive each expressly use the word \u201cwork\u201d when explaining SBIR phase III ; they do not mention the agency\u2019s requirement.  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 638(e)(4)(C); SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive  (May 2023) \u00a7 4(c).  Therefore, we agree \nwith the Air Force\u2019s interpretation of the SBIR phase III authority ; a proper SBIR phase  Page 8     B-423319   III award is for work  that derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .4  \nAccordingly, we deny the protest ground arguing that the Air Force improperly issued an  \nSBIR phase III solicitation to Clear Align because the agency\u2019s requirement  does not \nderive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR effort.  Digital Force\u2019s protest ground \nmisapplies  the relevant law and policy directive and therefore does not provide a basis \nto sustain the protest.5  \n \n Challenge to the Work to be Procured:  Clear Align\u2019s Proposed Increment 1 TSS   \n Digital Force argues that the Air Force has not properly determined that  Clear Align\u2019s \nproposed increment 1 TSS in fact derives from, extends, or completes the prior relevant \nSBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32- 38.  First, the protester  \nargues that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS does not qualify for  an SBIR phase III award \nbecause the record does not demonstrate the required link between the prior SBIR efforts and the proposed increment 1 TSS.  Protest at  28-29; Comments at  24-29.  In \nsupport of this argument, t he protester asserts that the Air Force did not  review the prior \nSBIR phase II efforts  to understand what was developed, nor did  the Air Force review \nthe proposed increment 1 TSS to ensure it derived from, extended, or completed those SBIR phase II efforts.  Comments at  21-29.  Second, Digital Force argues that the Air \nForce is improperly using SBIR phase III authority because only a single component of \nthe system to be acquired could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant \nprior SBIR efforts.  Protest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  Prior to discussing the \narguments, for context, we provide a brief explanation o f the solicitation and Clear \nAlign\u2019s  proposed increment 1 TSS.   \n \n \n4 We note that Digital Force recognizes this distinction in other areas of its pleadings.  \nSee e.g. , Comments at 21 (\u201cThe Air Force does not dispute that . . . the acquisition must \ninvolve \u2018work that derives from, extends, or completes efforts\u2019\u201d) . \n5 The protester\u2019s focus on the agency\u2019s requirements, as opposed to Clear Align\u2019s work, \nmay be a distinction without a difference.  In this regard, an agency\u2019s requirements are \nnot necessarily irrelevant to the determination of whether a procurement can properly be awarded as a n SBIR phase III.  Indeed, in some cases we have analyzed the \nagency\u2019s requirements in SBIR p hase III  matters .  See, e.g. , Toyon Research \nCorporation, B -409765, Aug. 5, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6  235 ( Toyon) ; PublicRelay , supra.  In \nthose cases, the protester s argued that the agency\u2019s requirements actually required the \naward of SBIR phase III agreements  on sole- source bases to the respective protester , \nand therefore we necessarily focused our analysis on the agency\u2019s requirements.  \nHowever, as explained above, the statute and policy directive clearly state that SBIR phase III refers to the work that will be performed.  Therefore, while an agency\u2019s \nrequirements may be relevant to the analysis of whether a procurement constitutes an  \nSBIR phase III procurement , the requirements themselves do not need to derive from, \nextend, or complete a prior phase I or II effort in order for an agency to properly use SBIR phase III.   Page 9     B-423319   As noted above, the agency issued a solicitation to Clear Align requesting a proposal to \ndeliver the TSS, \u201cwhich shall contain SBIR -derived technology.\u201d  AR, Tab 34, \nSolicitation at 5.  The solicitation instructed Clear Align to submit three volumes.   Id.  As \nrelevant here, the third volume had to contain \u201call information regarding Clear Align\u2019s SBIR- derived technology in its [] -TSS solution.\u201d  Id. at 8.  This volume had to identify the \nSBIR- derived components and relevant SBIR awards, explain how the ident ified \ncomponents derived from the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards, and include any test or production documentation associated with the relevant SBIR phase I or II awards.  Id.  \n In its proposal, Clear Align  stated that it s proposed increment 1 TSS system is called \nthe Mamba.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Clear Align describe d the Mamba \nas a \u201c turnkey \u201d solution meet ing all of the Air Force\u2019s operational and technical \nrequirements  as described in the SRD  and statement of work .  Id.  The Mamba includes \nan image assessment sensor on a pan tilt unit  based on Clear Align\u2019s Z 320 medium \nwave infrared (MWIR) camera.  Id.  According to Clear Align, t he Z 320 MWIR camera \nimplements technology from two prior SBIR efforts, SBIR topic No.  N-01-016 and SBIR \ntopic No.  AF071- 280, resulting in contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. \nFA9453- 08-C0069, respectively .\n6  Id. at 103-104; see also COS at  31. \n Under SBIR topic No. N01 -016, Clear Align developed optical fabrication processes for \ninfrared materials  (specifically , germanium ).  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  104.  \nUnder this topic, optical polishing techniques were developed which enabled accurate polishing of large optical components.  Id.  Clear Align a lso developed optical coating \nremoval processes, and optical coatings with increased optical efficiency and durability.  \nId.   \n Under SBIR topic No. AF071- 280, Clear Align designed a broadband image optic using \na high performance opto- mechanism design to receive information using a multi -band \nsensor.  Id.  at 105.  Under this topic, engineering principles and designs were \ndeveloped to allow smaller and more cost -effective optical systems to be designed and \nbuilt which would maintain imaging performance over a wide temperature range.  Id.  \n Clear Align\u2019s proposal stated  that following its prior SBIR efforts, it continued to invest in \nzoom lens design and fabrication methods to further advance zoom lens technology to create higher -performance infrared zoom cameras.  Id. at 107.  Clear Align explained \nthat its current generation of zoom cameras  are high- definition systems that use small \npixel pitch technology to offer  image clarity and range performance.  Id.  The firm further \nstate d that key design concepts from the prior SBIR efforts have been refined and are \nembedded into its current generation of cameras.  Id. at 107. \n \n \n6 There is no dispute that the prior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics, \nnot Clear Align.  However, for simplicity and because Clear Align was issued the solicitation as a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, our discussion in this \narea references the prior SBIR efforts as completed by Clear Align.    Page 10     B-423319   Digital Force argues  that Clear Align\u2019s proposed TSS solution does not qualify for  an \nSBIR phase III award because it does not derive from, extend, or complete a prior SBIR \neffort  and that the record does not support the Air Force\u2019s  conclusion that an  SBIR \nphase III award is proper .  As previously noted, the Air Force issued the instant SBIR \nphase III solicitation to Clear Align based on two prior SBIR phase II efforts completed \nby a firm called Computer Optics, under a theory that Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Co mputer Optics.  COS at 31 -34.   \n Digital Force argues the record does not support a conclusion that the Air Force reviewed the relevant SBIR phase II efforts before determining that Clear Align\u2019s proposed SBIR phase III increment 1 TSS derived from, extended, or completed those prior SBIR efforts.  Comments at  21-24.  Rather, Digital Force contends that the agency \nsimply accepted--without any scrutiny --Clear Align\u2019s explanation in its proposal that its \nincrement 1 TSS solution derives from, extends, or completes work from its prior SBIR efforts.   \n Digital Force  also argues that the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III to \nacquire a system where only a single component of the system could possibly derive from, extend, or complete the relevant prior SBIR efforts --the Z 320 MWIR camera.  \nProtest at  27-31; Comments at  32-38.  The protester argues that even if the Z 320 \nMWIR camera qualifies  as deriving from a prior SBIR effort (which it contests) , the Air \nForce cannot properly use SBIR phase III authority to procure its entire TSS s ystem  \nwhere the only component of the system deriving from the SBIR program might be the \nZ 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 32.  \n \nIn raising  this challenge,  Digital Force contends  that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS  is \nnot an  SBIR- derived produc t because it  consists of several  discrete components, many \nof which are commercially available off -the-shelf (COTS) items  available from multiple \nsources , and that the only components provided by  Clear Align itself are the Z 320 \nMWIR camera and an electro- optic camera.  Id.  at 32-33.  For example, Digital Force \nhighlights  Clear Align \u2019s proposed use of  COTS components  in its overall system  \ninclud ing a ruggedized laptop, a ruggedized tablet, radios, cables, ancillary equipment, \nand a lift mast.  Id.  at 33.    \n According to the protester, here, the Air Force is improperly using SBIR phase III authority to procure work ( i.e., the COTS items included in the TSS) which does not \nderive from, extend, or complete the prior SBIR effort.  Id.  at 34.  As a hypothetical \nexample to illustrate its point, Digital Force argues that under the Air Force\u2019s interpretation of the SBIR statute, a large defense contractor could purchase the rights to Clear Align\u2019s Z 320 MWIR camera, install the camera on a  C-40 aircraft, and win an  \nSBIR phase III award for the Air Force\u2019s C -40 fleet expansion program.  Id. at 36-37 \nn.115.    \n The Air Force defends its procurement.   MOL at 17- 21.  According to the agency, the \nrecord clearly demonstrates that the SBIR phase III solicitation was properly issued to  Page 11     B-423319   Clear Align for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts.  Id. \nat 18.   \n The Air Force notes that the SBIR statue describes the SBIR program as including a third phase for work that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts, but argues that the statute does not \u201cdefine or explain\u201d the meaning of that language.  Id.  \nat 18.  Based on the statutory language, t he Air Force asserts  that procuring agencies \nhave broad discretion to assess how an underlying SBIR effort is \u201cessential to the goal of a SBIR Phase III contract [,]\u201d and that, contrary to the protest ground, nothi ng in the \nrelevant authority suggests that \u201can entire solution or set of requirements must be wholly derived from the underlying effort. \u201d  Id. at 20.  Furthermore, the Air Force argues \nthat the record contains sufficient documentation explaining how Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS was considered and how it was determined that SBIR phase III authority properly  applies to the instant procurement.  Id.  at 21.  As discussed below, we \nfind no basis to sustain the protest.  \n With respect to an  SBIR phase III award, our Office has previously found that to show \none effort derives from, extends, or completes another, \u201cit must be evident that the requirements for the second effort incorporated original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results  that were generated in the first.\u201d  ASRC Federal Data Network \nTechnologies, LLC , B-418765, Aug.  28, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  339 at  6 (citing  Toyon at 16 \nn.15; see also PublicRelay , supra at 9 n.7.   As discussed more below, we find that the \n\u201coriginal concepts, findings, ideas, or research results\u201d language is not , however,  the \nappropriate test for the instant protest given its posture.   That is, here, we are examining \nwhether proposed work derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR efforts; we are \nnot examining whether the agency\u2019s  stated requirement derives from prior SBIR efforts.  \n Relying on the language in Toyon and PublicRelay , Digital Force argues that this \nprocurement does not qualify for  SBIR phase III because the agency\u2019s requirement \ndoes  not incorporate original concepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were \ngenerated in Clear Align\u2019s prior SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at 23- 27; Comments \nat 30-32.  However, as explained above, SBIR phase III refers to work that derives from, \nextends, or completes efforts performed under prior SBIR phase I or II awards.  An agency\u2019 s requirements are not dispositive as to whether a procurement can utilize  SBIR \nphase III.   \n Moreover, in Toyon and PublicRelay , our Office was analyzing protests arguing that  the \nagency was required to award SBIR phase III agreements to the respective protesters . \nThe protesters  argued that they should have received sole- source awards because the \nagency  sought contractors to perform requirements that the protesters argued were \nderived from the work the protesters had completed under prior SBIR efforts , or that the \nagency was requiring the contractor s to extend or complete the work they had \npreviously done.  Accordingly, our focus was on whether the government \u2019s \nrequirements  were based on work previously done by the protesters .   \n  Page 12     B-423319   In contrast, here,  the agency  is making a sole- source award to Clear Align  for its  \nproposed TSS solution , which is based on work Clear  Align has proposed in order  to \nmeet the agency\u2019s operational requirement .  In this context, t he relevant  question is \nwhether that proposed solution derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed \nunder the relevant  SBIR phase II awards.   Accordingly, we do not agree with the \nprotester  that the litmus test for determining whether this solicitation  is properly issued \nusing SBIR phase III is whether the agency\u2019s requirements incorporate original \nconcepts, findings, ideas, or research results that were generated in prior SBIR phase I \nor II efforts.7   \n In this posture,  and given the broad language used by the SBIR statute and the \nSBIR\/STTR policy directive  to describe SBIR phase III and the lack of  a precise \nexplanation as to what qualifies as work der iving from , extending , or complet ing a prior \nSBIR effort , we will review the record to determine whether the agency reasonably \nconcluded that this procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III in a manner that is \nconsistent with all applicable laws  and regulations.\n8  \n As detailed above, the instant solicitation was issued to Clear Align following several months of market research.  The contracting officer explains that in determining whether \nSBIR phase III authority could be used for the instant procurement, the agency  \nconcluded that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS constituted work deriving from two prior \nSBIR- funded efforts; contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 and contract No. \nFA9453- 08-C-0069.   COS at  28.  As part of this analysis, the agency prepared an SBIR \nphase III determi nation and findings (D&F) , and a commercial item D&F, on Clear \nAlign\u2019s increment 1 TSS.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F; AR, Tab 32 Commercial \nItem D&F.  \n \nIn the SBIR phase III D&F, the agency concluded that Clear Align\u2019s TSS derives from prior SBIR efforts and that Clear Align is therefore eligible for a sole- source contract \n \n7 Moreover, we clarify that the test in Toyon represented one potential approach to \ndetermine whether a procurement qualifies under  SBIR phase III when analyzing an \nagency\u2019s requirements .  That is, whether those requirements incorporate original \nconcepts, findings, ideas, or research results.  We think such an approach provides a \nreasonable assessment of whether the agency intends to procure a solution from contractors that derives from, extends, or completes prior SBIR phase I or II efforts \nbased on a review of the agency\u2019s requirements.  Here, the analysis is focused on whether the agency reasonably concluded that Clear Align\u2019s proposed work --the \nTSS--derived from, extended, or completed efforts performed under prior SBIR awards.  \n8 We note that the SBIR\/STTR policy directive provides three \u201ctypes of activit [ies]\u201d that \nconstitute SBIR phase III work , but no precise explanation.  SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive \n(May 2023) \u00a7\u00a7 4(c)(1)(i)- (iii).  For example, the policy directive lists as a type of activity \nconstituting SBIR\/STTR phase III work, \u201cSBIR\/STTR- derived products or services \nintended for  use by the Federal Government, funded by non- SBIR\/STTR sources of \nFederal funding.\u201d Id.  \u00a7 (4)(c)(1)(ii).   Page 13     B-423319   pursuant to 15 U.S.C. section 638(r)(4) .  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  4; see 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7  638(r)(4)  (stating that to the greatest extent practicable, federal agencies shall \nissue, without further justification, phase III awards relating to technology, including \nsole-source awards, to the SBIR award recipient that developed the technology).   \nIncluded as attachments in the SBIR phase III D&F a re copies of the prior SBIR efforts \nperformed by Computer Optics , the firm subsequently acquired by Clear Align .  AR, \nTab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 \n(contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404).          \n The SBIR phase III D&F memorialized the agency\u2019s consideration of the relevant SBIR phase II efforts and explained their relevance to the instant procurement.  Id. at 2-4.  \nFirst, the D&F explained that work performed under contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069 \nfacilitated the development of engineering principles and designs that enabled a smaller and more cost -effective Z 320 MWIR camera system that will be provided in Clear \nAlign\u2019s TSS.  Id.  at 2-3, 220.   Second, the D&F explained that contract \nNo. N68335- 02-C-0404 resulted in three developments which were incorporated into \nClear Align\u2019s TSS:  accurate polishing of infrared materials, enhanced durability of optical anti -reflection infrared coatings, and optical fabrication of infrared components \nwith challenging geometries and high levels of curvature.   Id. at 4.  The agency \nultimately concluded that Clear Align\u2019s proposed TSS \u201cdirectly benefits from the work performed under the two SBIR Phase II awards\u201d because those prior SBIR efforts \u201cenhanced the performance, manufacturability, and environmental res istance of the \nZ 320 MWIR camera[.]\u201d  Id.  \n In the commercial item D&F, the agency determined that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS \nmet the definition of a commercial product with minor modifications.  AR, Tab 32, Commercial Item D&F at  2.  In reaching this conclusion, the agency found that Clear \nAlign \u2019s TSS was assigned commercial part number VZ320HD -3000, the TSS included \nClear Align\u2019s Z 320 MWIR camera,  which has been commercialized since 2023, the \nZ 320 MWIR camera used for the TSS included a minor modification to meet size and \nweight requirements established in the agency\u2019s SRD, and that the minor modification did not alter the essential characteristics of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Id. at 2-3.  The \nagency found that the SBIR -derived component of the TSS, the Z 320 MWIR camera, \naccounted for 32 percent of the total cost per TSS unit, and that the TSS included other major components that are COTS items.  Id.  at 3-4. \n As discussed above, Digital Force argues that the Air Force unreasonably concluded (and insufficiently documented its conclusion)  that Clear Align\u2019s solution qualified for  an \nSBIR phase III  award.   The protester also argues  that the agency is improperly using \nSBIR phase III authority to acquire a system largely composed of COTS components \nwhere only a single component of the system , the Z 320 MWIR camera,  could have \npossibly derive d from, extended, or completed  the relevant prior SBIR efforts .  Protest \nat 27-31; Comments at  21-29, 32-38.  We have reviewed these challenges and find no \nbasis to sustain the protest.   Based on our review of the record, we decline to disturb \nthe Air Force\u2019s conclusion that Clear Align\u2019s increment 1 TSS derives from, extends, or  Page 14     B-423319   completes prior SBIR efforts.  The record shows that the agency reasonably concluded \nClear Align\u2019s proposed solution derives from work developed under prior SBIR efforts.    \n \nContrary to Digital Force\u2019s arguments, t he record includes  sufficient evidence and \nsupport showing how the  Air Force reached its conclusion that the proposed increment \n1 TSS derived from a prior SBIR effort.  This includes  copies of the prior SBIR \ncontracts , which list the details of the work to be completed under those contracts, a \ncopy of the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS, a copy of Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS, an explanation of the SBIR -derived technology in Clear \nAlign\u2019s  proposed solution, and D&F documents evaluating the proposed increment 1 \nTSS against the prior SBIR efforts.  AR, Tab 33, SBIR Phase III D&F at 1- 4 \n(analysis),  165-194 (contract No.  FA9453- 08-C-0069), 221- 264 (contract \nNo. N68335- 02-C-0404); AR, Tab 34, Solicitation; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal.    \n As previously discussed, the SBIR statute and policy directive set forth very limited requirements to justify a n SBIR phase III solicitation or award.  The record here contains \nample documentation and evidentiary support showing how the Air Force reasonably concluded that Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS derives from the relevant prior \nSBIR phase  II contracts.   \n To the extent that Digital Force criticizes the agency\u2019s review of the prior SBIR phase II efforts or its review of Clear Align\u2019s proposal, we find that such criticism amounts to disagreement with the agency\u2019s judgments which does not provide a basis to sustain this protest.   See MiMoCloud , B-419482, Mar.  25, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  157 at  7.  While \nthe protester may wish the agency had done more independent research or analysis by \ngoing outside of the contents of Clear Align\u2019s proposal in some way, the protester cites no authority requiring such an effort.\n9     \n In addition, we find no basis to sustain the protester\u2019s argument that the agency is improperly using SBIR phase III to procure a system that is made up of COTS components and only a single component could qualify for  an SBIR phase III  award.  In \nthis regard, Digital Force points to no statue, regulation, or other legal authority stating that an agency may not use SBIR phase III authority to procure a system where only a \ncomponent of the overall system derives from, extends, or completes a prior SBIR effort .  Here, the agency is procuring a security system that requires, for example, \nsurveillance capability, motion detection, video assessment, and sensing technologies, and Clear Align is providing within its overall system, an  SBIR- derived camera.  AR, \nTab 34, Solicitation at  39; AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  4.  Thus, the \nSBIR- derived component is reasonably related to the overall objective of the system the \nagency seeks to procure.  Accordingly, this procurement is not similar to Digital Force\u2019s hypot hetical example and cautionary tale involving the Air Force\u2019s C -40 fleet expansion \nprogram .   \n \n9 For example, Digital Force opines that the Air Force could have produced evidence \nthat engineers \u201cperformed a technical analysis\u201d of the Z 320 MWIR camera.  Comments at 26.   Page 15     B-423319    \nIn sum, there simply is no requirement in statute or the policy directive that the entirety \nof a phase III solution must be derived from prior SBIR efforts.   As such , we find that the \nAir Force reasonably concluded Clear Align\u2019s proposed increment 1 TSS derived from the relevant SBIR phase II efforts, and that the record sufficiently supports the agency\u2019s conclusion.   This protest ground is denied.  \n SBIR Phase III Successor -in-Interest Entities  \n Digital Force argues that Clear Align is not eligible to receive an  SBIR phase III contract \nbecause Clear Align is not a proper successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics, the \nfirm that completed the prior  SBIR phase II efforts.  Protest at  20 n.61; Comments \nat 16-21.  In this regard, Digital Force argues that Clear  Align does not meet the \ndefinition of a successor -in-interest entity , as defined by the SBIR\/STTR policy directive.  \nComments at  19-21.  Digital Force alleges that the record does not support a conclusion \nthat Clear Align acquired Computer Optics and that Clear Align\u2019s proposal misrepresents the merger of the relevant companies.  Id. at 16-18.  As discussed below, \nwe deny the protest.\n10  \n Relevant here, t he SBIR statue includes the following language:  \n \nIn general.  In the case of a small business concern that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR program, a Federal agency m ay enter into a Phase III agreement with that business concern \nfor additional work to be performed during or after the Phase II period.  \n \n* * * * * \n To the greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies . . . shall . . . issue, without further justification, Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients  that \ndeveloped the technology.  \n \n \n10 Digital Force also challenges the agency\u2019s reliance on the SBIR\/STTR policy \ndirective\u2019s guidance for successor -in-interest firms.  Comments at 18 -19.  According to \nthe protester, the SBIR\/STTR policy directive conflicts with the SBIR statute, which, accor ding to the protester, does not contemplate SBIR phase III awards to any business \nconcern other than the concern that completed the prior SBIR effort.  Id. (citing \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7  638(r)(1)) ; see SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) \u00a7 6(a)(5) .  We \ndismiss this protest ground as untimely.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(2).  In the protest , Digital \nForce recognized t he relevance of  Clear Align \u2019s status as a successor -in-interest  entity  \nto Computer Optics  but did not  challenge the SBIR\/STTR policy directive\u2019s guidance on \nsuccess- in-interest firms as inconsistent with the SBIR statut e.  Protest at 20 n.61.  \nBecause the challenge appear s for the first time in Digital Force\u2019s comments on the \nagency report, it is untimely.   4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(2).   Page 16     B-423319   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  638(r)(1), (4).  \n \nIn implementing the SBIR statute, the SBIR\/STTR policy directive explains that:  \n \nAn SBIR\/STTR Awardee may include, and SBIR\/STTR work may be performed by, those identified via a \u201cnovated\u201d or \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d or similarly -revised Funding Agreement.  For example, a Phase III Awardee \nmay have either received a prior Phase I or Phas e II award or been \nnovated a Phase I or Phase II award (or received a revised Phase I or Phase II award if a grant or cooperative grant) or be a successor -in-interest entity.  \n SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) \u00a7  6(a)(5).\n11   \n As previously  discussed, the agency determined that Clear Align\u2019s proposed \nincrement  1 TSS included  work deriv ing from two prior SBIR efforts .  See AR, Tab 35, \nClear Align Proposal at  103-104; see also COS at  31.  There is no dispute that these \nprior SBIR efforts were completed by Computer Optics.  See AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase \nIII D&F at  165 ( showing contract No. FA9453- 08-C-0069 issued to Computer Optics ); \nId. at 221 ( showing contract No.  N68335- 02-C-0404 issued to Computer Optics ).  \nAccordingly, the question we must answer is whether Clear Align properly qualifies as an eligible  SBIR phase III awardee on the theory that it is a successor -in-interest entity \nto Computer Optics.   \n Clear Align\u2019s proposal explained that Clear Align acquired the assets of Computer \nOptics on March 26, 2013.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  The proposal \nstate d that all \u201cintellectual property including, without limitation, patents, computer \nsoftware, data, trademarks, trade secrets, know -how, processes, formulae, designs, \ndrawings, and technical data were assigned to Clear Align, LLC at the closing of the sale.\u201d   Id.  Included as an attachment to the proposal wa s an excerpt of the asset \npurchase agreement entered into between Clear Align and Computer Optics.\n12  Id. \nat 109-110. \n \n \n11 When the SBA updated this language regarding a successor -in-interest , it stated that \n\u201c[a]n entity may be considered a successor -in-interest, if it has secured the transfer of: \n(1) All the small business concern\u2019s assets; or (2) the entire portion of the assets involved in performing the award.\u201d  Small Business Innovation Research Program and \nSmall Business Technology Transfer Program Policy Directive, 85 Fed. Reg. 50062, 50063 (Aug., 17, 2020) .  However, we note that this language does not appear in the \ncurrent version of the SBIR\/STTR policy directive.   In fact, the SBIR\/STTR policy \ndirective does not provide a definition of, or any examples of what qualifies as, a successor -in-interest entity.  See SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May 2023) \u00a7  6(a)(5).    \n12 A full copy of the asset purchase agreement is included as part of the record.  AR, \nTab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216.

The asset purchase agreement stated  that \n\u201cBuyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Buy er, substantially \nall of the assets of Seller relating to the Business, and Buyer intends to thereafter \noperate the Business as a division of Buyer (the \u2018 Computer Optics Division \u2019).\u201d  Id.

The Air Force also recognized the relevant SBIR \nphase II awards were performed by Computer Optics.  Id. at 2-3.  Based on its review of \nthe above referenced asset purchase agreement, the Air Force concluded that Clear Align was properly considered a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics  \nbecause Clear Align had acquired the assets of Computer Optics, to include all of \nComputer Optics\u2019 intellectual property , and that Clear Align was eligible for an  SBIR \nphase III award based on the prior SBIR efforts completed by Computer Optics.  Id.  \nat 2-4. \n Digital Force challenges the agency\u2019s conclusion that Clear Align is an eligible SBIR phase III awardee under a successor -in-interest theory.  Comments at 16- 21.  The \nprotester raises multiple challenges in this regard but the gravamen is that Clear Align\u2019s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the record do not sufficiently establish that Clear Align acquired Computer Optics or the relevant SBIR phase II awards.  See id.   For example, Digital Force argues that Computer Optics still exists as \na discrete business concern and therefore Clear Align could not have acquired Computer Optics .  Id. at 17.  As another exam ple, Digital Force contends that the asset \npurchase agreement does not clearly define what intellectual property was conveyed \nfrom Computer Optics to Clear Align in the 2013 transaction because the agreement \nstated that Clear Align acquired intellectual property used in connection with \u201cthe Business\u201d but did not specify which business .  Id.  \n  Page 18     B-423319   The Air Force argues that the record supports its conclusion that Clear Align is a \nsuccessor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of SBIR phase III \neligibility.  Supp. COS at  2-4.  The agency argues that the record shows Computer \nOptics \u201cn o longer exists as a separate entity, but began operating as a division under \nClear Align upon completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement. \u201d  Id. at 3.  The agency \nfurther argues that Clear Align acquired substantially all of Computer Optics\u2019 assets relatin g to \u201cthe Business ,\u201d which include d all of Computer Optics\u2019 intellectual property.  \nId. at 3-4.  The agency maintains that it properly reviewed and relied upon the asset \npurchase agreement  executed between Clear Align and Computer Optics, and \nreasonably concluded that based on that agreement, Clear Align is a successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics for the purpose of the instant SBIR \nphase III solicitation.  Id. at 4.  \n Based on our review of the record, we agree with the Air Force.  We find no basis to question the agency\u2019s conclusion that Clear Align is a proper successor -in-interest entity \nto Computer Optics.  Here, the agency reasonably relied on Clear Align\u2019s proposal and the asset purchase agreement included in the proposal to find that Clear Align had \nacquired Computer Optics .  The proposal states that Clear Align acquired Computer \nOptics on March 26, 2013, and that as part of this acquisition, Clear Align acquired all of Computer Optics\u2019 intellectual property.  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at  108.  This \nassertion is supported by the contents of the asset purchase agreement.  See id. \nat 109-110; see also AR, Tab 33, SBIR phase III D&F at 195- 216 (complete copy of the \nasset purchase agreement).   \n While Digital Force disagrees that the agency properly recognized Clear Align as a \nsuccessor -in-interest  entity , it has not demonstrated that the agency acted \nunreasonably.  Other than challenging the legal sufficiency of the asset purchase \nagreement, Digital Force provides no support for its contention that Computer Optics \nstill exists as a discrete business concern or why this would disqualify Clear Align as a successor -in-interest even if it did.   See e.g. , Comments at  17, 20; Resp. to Supp. \nBriefing at  5-7.   \n To the extent Digital Force contends that the asset purchase agreement did not specify from which business or intellectual property would be acquired, the protester attempts to \nintroduce ambiguity where there is none.  Id.  at 7-10.  The asset purchase agreement \ndefined Computer Optics\u2019 \u201c high- tech optics business \u201d as \u201cthe Business.\u201d  T here is no \nother business referenced in the agreement or reason to believe that this definition did not encompass all of Computer Optics\u2019 business.   Further, as detailed above, the asset \npurchase agreement stated that the \u201cBuyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller . . . \nall intellectual property used or usable in connection with the Business[.]\u201d  AR, Tab 35, Clear Align Proposal at 109- 110.  Given that the asset agreement defined only one \n\u201cBusiness,\u201d we have no reason to believe that  \u201call intellectual property\u201d did not include \nComputer Optic\u2019s intellectual property resulting from the prior SBIR efforts.  \n In sum, in  accordance with the SBIR\/STTR policy directive, we find that the Air Force \nproperly issued the SBIR phase III solicitation for the increment 1 TSS to Clear Align as  Page 19     B-423319   the successor -in-interest entity to Computer Optics.  SBIR\/STTR Policy Directive (May \n2023) \u00a7 6(a)(5).  While Digital Force contests the Air Force\u2019s conclusion that the asset \npurchase agreement demonstrate d Clear Align\u2019s acquisition of Computer Optics, the \nprotester has not established that the agency\u2019s conclusion was erroneous or otherwise \ncontrary to relevant law or regulation.  Absent such a clear showing, we decline to sustain the protest on this basis.   The protest is denied.   Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n  "

        "Summary":"Protest challenging solicitation provisions as unduly restrictive of competition is denied where the provisions are reasonably related to the agency\u2019s requirements.  \nDECISION  \n K&K JL Services, Inc., a small business of Concord, California, challenges the terms and conditions of request for proposals (RFP) No. FA480025R0009, issued by the Department of the Air Force for grounds maintenance at Joint Base Langley -Eustis \n(JBLE), Vir ginia.  The protester contends that the solicitation is unduly restrictive of \ncompetition.  \n We deny the protest.  \n BACKGROUND  \n \nOn February 11, 2025, the Air Force issued the RFP as a total small business set -aside \npursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) parts 12 and 15.  Agency Report \n(AR), Tab  9, RFP at 1.\n1  The solicitation contemplates the award of a single fixed- price \ncontract for grounds maintenance at JBLE with a base period of 8 months and two 1-year option periods.

K&K is the incumbent provider of the services, currently performing under a contract awarded in May 2024.  Protest  \nat 5. \n The RFP provides for award to be made on a lowest -price, technically acceptable \n(LPTA) basis, considering the following evaluation factors:  (1) price; (2) technical; and (3) past performance.  RFP at 73.  The technical and past performance factors will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis.  Id. at 74- 75.  With respect to past \nperformance, the solicitation states that offerors \u201cshall provide at least two (2) references . . . for recent past performance of similar size and scope requirements \nas detailed\u201d in the PWS.  Id.  at 75.  Here, the RFP defined relevant size of a past project \nas a contract \u201cwith a value of at least $1M per year.\u201d\n2  Id. \n Past performance will be evaluated as \u201cacceptable\u201d if, based \u201con the offeror\u2019s performance record,\u201d the agency has \u201ca reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort,\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d if the agency does not.  Id.  \nat 74.  The solicitation provides that \u201can offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned\u201d shall be determined to have a rating of unknown, which will be considered acceptable.  Id.  at 75.  \n Proposals were due by March 7, and the agency received four proposals, including one from K&K.  RFP at 1; COS at 7.  K&K filed this protest of the solicitation prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester challenges the solicitation\u2019s past performance evaluation factor as unduly restrictive of competition.  The protester does not object to the solicitation\u2019s definitions of relevant past performance with respect to recency (within the past five years) or scope \n(similar depth and breadth of grounds maintenance).  See  RFP at 75.  Instead, t he \nprotester focuses its challenge on two issues:  (1) requiring two past performance \nreferences; and (2) defining relevant size as a project with a value of at least $1 million per year .  Protest at 7.  According to K&K, these requirements are unduly restrictive of \ncompetition because they effectively exclude a number of small businesses that are capable of the work.\n3  Id. at 7-8 (\u201cQuite simply, the past performance criteria outlined \n \n2 The RFP also defined recent performance as \u201coccurring within the last 5 years\u201d and \nrelevant scope as a project that \u201cinvolves the depth and breadth of work described in this PWS (i.e. mowing, trimming, edging, mulch, flower bed maintenance, and tractor operations to present a neat, clean, and professional appearance).\u201d  RFP at 75.  \n3 While we do not discuss every premutation of every argument raised by the protester, \nwe have considered them all thoroughly and conclude that none provides a basis to sustain the protest.

Columbia Imaging, Inc. , \nB-286772.2, B -287363, Apr. 13, 2001, 2001 CPD \u00b6 78 at 2.  Our Office will not sustain a \nprotest challenging an agency\u2019s determination of its needs unless the protester presents  \nclear and convincing evidence that the specifications are in fact impossible to meet or unduly restrict competition.

To the extent a protester \nchallenges a specification as unduly restrictive, that is, challenges both the restrictive nature of the requirement as well as the agency\u2019s need for the restriction, the procuring agency has the responsibility of establishing that the specification is reasonably necessary to meet its needs.  Smith & Nephew, Inc. , B-410453, Jan. 2, 2015, \n2015 CPD \u00b6 90 at 5.  The adequacy of the agency\u2019s justification is ascertained through \nexamining whether the agency\u2019s explanation is reasonable,  in other words,  whether it \ncan withstand logical scrutiny.   Id. \n As an initial matter, the protester attempts to elide a fundamental element with respect to our review of solicitation requirements that are alleged to be unduly restrictive of competition.  It is true that our Office has sustained challenges to solicitati on \nrequirements that restrict competition and are not reasonably related to the agency\u2019s needs.  See, e.g. , Pitney Bowes, Inc. , B-413876.2, Feb. 13, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 56.  In \nthose instances, however, the challenged solicitation requirements generally restr icted \ncompetition by preventing the protester from competing.  Pitney Bowes, Inc., supra.  \n Here, the protester has, in fact, submitted a proposal --in response to the current \nRFP--that identifies two past performance references for grounds maintenance work with dollar values of more than $1 million per year.  AR, Tab 38, K&K Proposal Vol. 3 at 3-5.  Although the protester asserts that \u201cit is not sure whether the references it \nsubmitted will be considered relevant,\u201d K&K\u2019s concerns in that regard are not based on the number of past performance references required or the size of either reference.  See Comments at  3.  Accordingly, because the protester has demonstrated the ability to \nsubmit --and has, in fact, submitted--a proposal that met the number and size \nrequirements for past performance under the RFP as written, the protester has not demonstrated competitive prejudice.  McGoldrick Constr . Servs . Corp ., B-419327,  \nJan. 15, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 53 at 12 (finding that \u201c because the protester clearly believed \nit was able to make a responsive offer to the RFP as written and has not argued to the contrary, the protester has not demonstrated competitive prejudice with respect to the bonding requirement \u201d).   \n Competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest, and, where a prospective offeror has not shown competitive prejudice stemming from a solicitation provision, the offeror is not an interested party to challenge that provision.  See DNC Parks & Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. , B-410998, April 14, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 127 at 12- 13 \n(concluding that an offeror that did not demonstrate that it was competitively prejudiced  Page 4 B-423367  by a solicitation provision was not an interested party to challenge that provision); see \nalso Government & Mil .

Here, the protester has submitted a \nproposal and has not otherwise alleged or demonstrated that it is unable to compete based on the solicitation criteria it challenges in this protest.   \n In any event , even disregarding the fact that the protester has not demonstrated \ncompetitive prejudice with respect to the past performance criteria, this protest ground is also substantively without merit.   Preliminarily, we note that nowhere in the solicitation \ndoes it provide that offerors without two relevant past performance references will be deemed ineligible for award.  RFP at 75.  To the contrary, the RFP explicitly advises:  \n \nIn the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonable assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favor ably or unfavorably on past \nperformance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have \u201cUnknown\u201d past performance.  In the context of  \nacceptability\/unacceptability, \u201cUnknown\u201d shall be considered \u201cAcceptable.\u201d  \n Id.  Therefore, under this solicitation--which provides for selection on an LPTA basis --an \nofferor without a record of relevant past performance remains eligible for award.\n4  See \nid. at 75.  \n Furthermore, the record reflects that the contract here is expected to have a value in excess of $1 million per year.  The Air Force prepared an independent government cost \n \n4 K&K objects to the solicitation in this regard.  Comments at 5- 8.  Although K&K frames \nits objection as an issue of an ambiguity in the solicitation, it is apparent that K&K\u2019s real objection is to the agency\u2019s reservation of the right to consider \u201cinformation available in the Contractor Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and any other sources identified by the offeror or the Government\u201d in the evaluation of past performance.  See id.; RFP at 75.  That is, K&K asserts that, if an offeror submits past performance \nreferences, the agency should be limited to evaluating only those submitted references, and the agency should not be permitted to consider CPARS or other information about any contract that the offeror does not identify as a reference in its proposal.  Comments \nat 8.  There is, however, nothing inherently improper or unreasonable with the agency \nretaining the discretion to look to sources of past performance outside of those specifically submitted by the offeror, provided all offers  are evaluated on the same basis \nand the evaluation is consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Cf. J. Squared Inc. , \nd\/b\/a Univ. Loft Co., B -417010, B -417010.2, B -417010, Jan. 22, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 65 \nat 4 (discussing agency discretion to consider information beyond that submitted in a \nproposal in evaluating past performance).  As such, we find no basis to sustain K&K\u2019s objection here.   Page 5 B-423367  estimate of approximately $[DELETED] for the overall potential 2- year and 8- month \nperiod of performance being competed under this solicitation.  COS at 4.  This is \nconsistent with the protester\u2019s incumbent contract for this work, which has a base- year \nprice of approximately $2.4 million.   Id. at 2.  According to the Air Force, the grounds \nmaintenance work \u201cis critical because controlling vegetation near air strips reduces the \nlikelihood that wildlife (e.g., birds) will strike Air Force planes in transit.\u201d  COS at 5.  As a \nresult of \u201cdocumented\u201d performance issues with the last two contractors performing \ngrounds maintenance at JBLE, the agency considers \u201c[r]eliable contractor performance [to be] necessary to meet this essential mission.\u201d  Memorandum of Law at  2, 4.   \n \nIn short, the Air Force\u2019s requirement that offerors submit at least two past performance \nreferences with a yearly value over $1 million are reasonably related to the agency\u2019s \nrequirements here.  Cf. WILLCOR Inc. , B-422358, May 22, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 122 \nat 5-6 (finding agency\u2019s minimum requirements for corporate experience were \nreasonably explained by reference to the expected contract value and performance requirements).

The Air Force prepared an independent government cost \n \n4 K&K objects to the solicitation in this regard.  Comments at 5- 8.  Although K&K frames \nits objection as an issue of an ambiguity in the solicitation, it is apparent that K&K\u2019s real objection is to the agency\u2019s reservation of the right to consider \u201cinformation available in the Contractor Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and any other sources identified by the offeror or the Government\u201d in the evaluation of past performance.  See id.; RFP at 75.  That is, K&K asserts that, if an offeror submits past performance \nreferences, the agency should be limited to evaluating only those submitted references, and the agency should not be permitted to consider CPARS or other information about any contract that the offeror does not identify as a reference in its proposal.  Comments \nat 8.  There is, however, nothing inherently improper or unreasonable with the agency \nretaining the discretion to look to sources of past performance outside of those specifically submitted by the offeror, provided all offers  are evaluated on the same basis \nand the evaluation is consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Cf. J. Squared Inc. , \nd\/b\/a Univ. Loft Co., B -417010, B -417010.2, B -417010, Jan. 22, 2019, 2019 CPD \u00b6 65 \nat 4 (discussing agency discretion to consider information beyond that submitted in a \nproposal in evaluating past performance).  As such, we find no basis to sustain K&K\u2019s objection here.   Page 5 B-423367  estimate of approximately $[DELETED] for the overall potential 2- year and 8- month \nperiod of performance being competed under this solicitation.  COS at 4.  This is \nconsistent with the protester\u2019s incumbent contract for this work, which has a base- year \nprice of approximately $2.4 million.   Id. at 2.  According to the Air Force, the grounds \nmaintenance work \u201cis critical because controlling vegetation near air strips reduces the \nlikelihood that wildlife (e.g., birds) will strike Air Force planes in transit.\u201d  COS at 5.  As a \nresult of \u201cdocumented\u201d performance issues with the last two contractors performing \ngrounds maintenance at JBLE, the agency considers \u201c[r]eliable contractor performance [to be] necessary to meet this essential mission.\u201d  Memorandum of Law at  2, 4.   \n \nIn short, the Air Force\u2019s requirement that offerors submit at least two past performance \nreferences with a yearly value over $1 million are reasonably related to the agency\u2019s \nrequirements here.  Cf. WILLCOR Inc. , B-422358, May 22, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 122 \nat 5-6 (finding agency\u2019s minimum requirements for corporate experience were \nreasonably explained by reference to the expected contract value and performance requirements).  On this record, we find no basis to sustai n the protest that the \nevaluation requirement s are unduly restrictive of competition.  \n The protest is denied.

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the scope of the agency\u2019s corrective action that includes amending \nthe solicitation to include a provision for a price realism  evaluation is denied where the \nagency acted within its discretion to reasonably determine what corrective action is \nappropriate to remedy a flaw in the procurement process.   \nDECISION  \n Catalyst Solutions, LLC  (Catalyst), a service- disabled veteran- owned small business \n(SDVOSB) located in Stafford, Virginia, protests the corrective action undertaken by the \nUnited States Marine Corps  (USMC) , in response to Catalyst \u2019s protest challenging the \nagency\u2019s issuance of a competitive task order to Alexandria Insights, Inc. (Alexandria \nInsights), located in Stafford, Virginia,  pursuant to request for proposals (RFP) \nNo. M67854- 24-R- 3014, to provide program management support services.  The \nprotester alleges that the agency\u2019s proposed corrective action is unreasonable.    \n We deny the protest.   \n BACKGROUND  \n The RFP, issued o n September 16, 2024, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation \nsection 16.505 to SDVOSB firms in the National Capital Zone 2 under the Department \nof the Navy\u2019s  SeaPort  indefinite- delivery, indefinite -quantity contract , sought proposals \nfor a contractor to provide support services for the USMC\u2019s Program Manager \nExpeditionary Radars portfolio to include both the ground\/air task oriented radar \nprogram management and product manager future radar systems.  The solicited DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This version has been approved for public release. \n \n  Page 2    B-423269.2   support services include program management; acquisition and scheduling; business \nand finance; logistics, fielding and training; and engineering, manufacturing and testing-\nrelated activities to include acquisition policy and program documentation development .  \nB-423269, Protest exh. 1, RFP at  8.1   \n \nThe RFP anticipated issuance of a single, fixed -price task order on a best -value tradeoff \nbasis  for a 5- year period of performance.  Id.  at 80.  The best -value decision was to be \nbased on t he following evaluation factors :  technical ; past performance;  and price.  Id.   \nUnder the solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria, the technical factor was more important than \npast performance,  and both non- price factors , when combined,  were more important \nthan price.  Id.  The solicitation also established that the agency m ight issue the task \norder to other than the lowest -priced or highest -rated offeror.  Id.   \n The technical factor was comprised of three task elements:  technical approach and \nunderstanding;  management approach;  and transition plan.  Id.  at 80- 81.  Under these \ntask elements , proposals would be assigned ratings of significant strengths, strengths, \nweaknesses, significant weaknesses, or deficiencies  as defined in the solicitation and \nproposals would be assigned overall ratings of either outstanding, good, acceptable, \nmarginal, or unacceptable under the technical factor .  Id. at 81-82.   \n Two offerors submitted t imely proposals in response to the solicitation--Catalyst and \nAlexandria Insights .  Following the evaluation of proposals , the agency assigned \nCatalyst\u2019s technical proposal an overall rating of acceptable with an evaluated total price \nof $35,431,630.  See  B-423269, Protest exh. 3a, Technical and Past Performance Eval .  \nat 1; exh. 3b, Price Eval. Report at 2.  The agency assigned Alexandria Insights\u2019 \ntechnical proposal an overall rating of outstanding with an evaluated total price of \n$53,917,708.  Id., exh. 3b, Price Eval. Report at 2; Protest exh. 3, Post-Award Debrief \nat 2.  The agency determined that Alexandria Insights\u2019 higher -rated, higher -priced \nproposal represented the best value to the government  and issued the task order to \nAlexandria Insights  on December 20, 2024.   \n On January 7, 2025, after receipt of the award notice and a debriefing, Catalyst filed a protest challenging the issuance of the task order to Alexandria Insights, which our \nOffice docketed as B -423269.  In that protest, Catalyst alleged that the agency \nunreasonably evaluated its technical proposal  as acceptable, raising a number of \nchallenges to the agency\u2019s assessment of significant weaknesses and weaknesses in \nits proposal.  Additionally, Catalyst alleged that the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff \nanalysis was unreasonable, arguing that USMC failed to reasonably explain or \ndocument why the 52 percent price premium associated with selecting Alexandria \nInsights\u2019 higher -priced proposal was justified.   \n \n \n1 Citations to the RFP are to amendment 0002, which was  provided in Catalyst\u2019s prior \nprotest B -423269,  as Protest exhibit 1.

Page 3    B-423269.2   On January 27, after reviewing Catalyst\u2019s protest, USMC advised our Office of its intent \nto take voluntary corrective action.  Specifically, the agency would:  (1) amend the \nsolicitation to i nclude a provision to evaluate proposals for price realism; (2) request and \nevaluate revised price proposal s for realism ; (3) conduct a new evaluation of technical \nproposal s; and (4) conduct a new tradeoff analysis and source selection decision.  See  \nB-423269, Notice of Corrective Action at  1.  As a result  of the agency\u2019s proposed \ncorrective action, o ur Office dismissed the protest as academic .  Catalyst Solutions, \nLLC, B-423269, Jan. 29, 2025 (unpublished decision).    \n \nThereafter, Catalyst filed this protest challenging the scope of the proposed corrective \naction, which our Office docketed as B -423269.2.2   \n DISCUSSION  Catalyst objects to the scope of the agency\u2019s corrective action.  S pecifically, Catalyst \nargues that it is unreasonable for the agency to amend the solicitation to include a provision for price realism  because,  in its prior protest, it did not allege that the agency \nfailed to evaluate proposals for realism.  Therefore, the protester asserts, USMC cannot \njustify this aspect of the proposed corrective action on the basis of any need to remedy \na perceived defect that did not exist.  See generally , Protest at 4 -6.  According to the \nprotester , the corrective action notice \u201cpres ents no explanation of how a price realism \nanalysis is related to a revised best value tradeoff decision\u201d id.  at 4, alleging that the \nagency\u2019s corrective action should be limited to the defects it is intended to remedy.   \n In support of its position, the protester relies on prior decisions of our Office, including \nKupono Gov\u2019t Servs., LLC; Akima Sys. Eng\u2019g, LLC , B-421392.9 et al., June  5, 2023, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 136, in which we sustained a protest of a corrective action on the basis that \nthere was no explanation in the contemporaneous record related to the supposed flaw \nin the procurement  that support ed that agency\u2019s decision to take corrective action.  \nAmong other findings, we stated that  when an agency undertakes corrective action, the \nunderlying reasons for the agency decision must be meaningfully explained so that our \nOffice can assess whether the proposed corrective action is appropriate to remedy the \ndefects identified by the agency in the procurement  process .  Kupono Gov\u2019t Servs., \nLLC; Akima Sys. Eng\u2019g, LLC , supra at 3.   \n \nUSMC responds that it s decision to a mend the solicitation to include a provision for \nevaluation of price realism was to address additional concerns identified in this \nprocurement process.  In this regard, the contracting officer explained that any concerns with unrealistic pricing during the initial evaluation was mitigated by the fact that the agency ultimately selected Alexandria Insights\u2019 higher -rated, higher -priced proposal.  \nAccording to t he agency :  \n \n2 As noted, t he awarded value of the previously awarded task order exceeded  \n$35 million.  Accordingly, this protest is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to \nthe issuance of orders under multiple- award IDIQ contracts that were awarded under \nthe authority of title 10 of the United States Code.  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3406(f)(1)(B ).  Page 4    B-423269.2    \nDuring price evaluation, the Agency noted wide pricing discrepancies in \nthe proposals it received from all offerors.   After concluding the \ntechnical and past performance evaluations, I determined that the \naddition of a price realism provision and new round of price evaluation was not necessary as, pursuant to the relative importance of the three evaluation factors, [Alexandria Insights\u2019] proposal was the most \nadvantageous to the Government and its offer price was in line with the Government\u2019s Independent Government Cost Estimate.  \n Contracting Officer \u2019s Statement at 2- 3 (internal citation omitted) . \n The agency represents that  after reviewing Catalyst\u2019s initial protest challenging the \naward decision, the contracting officer determined that taking corrective action t o amend \nthe solicitation to include a provision for price realism was in the best interest s of the \ngovernment.  In this regard,  to the extent that the agency\u2019s reevaluation could result in \nthe consideration of  significantly lower -priced proposal s for award , the agency believed \nit was important to assess whether the prices of such proposals were realistic  during the \nreevaluation.   Specifically, the contracting officer stated :   \n \nGiven that some pricing received from the original proposals was so drastically low, I am reasonably concerned that it demonstrates a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements.   If an \nofferor were to receive the award, and subsequently be unable to perform at the award price, the disruption to [ Program Manager]  \nExpeditionary Radars would be significant . . . .  \n Id. at 3.   \n Given these identified concerns, the agency argues that amending the solicitation to \ninclude a provision for price realism and allowing offerors to submit revised price proposals, would allow the agency to assess whether the selected contractor can perform the entirety of the solicited services at its offered price.  Memorandum of Law \nat 6-7.  USMC therefore asserts that this aspect of the agency\u2019s proposed corrective \naction is reasonable to address the concerns that it identified.  Id.    \n Contracting agencies have broad discretion to take corrective action where the agency \ndetermines that such action is necessary to ensure a fair and impartial competition, and, \ngenerally, the details of a corrective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the contracting agency.

Our Office will not object to any particular corrective action so long as it is \nappropriate to remedy the reasonable concern that caused the agency to take \ncorrective action.  See  e.g., 360 IT Integrated Solutions; VariQ Corp. , B-414650.19  \net al. , Oct. 15, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 359 at 6 citing  MSC Indus.

Page 5    B-423269.2    \nMoreover, our review is generally limited to whether the agency\u2019s corrective action is appropriate to remedy the flaw which the agency believes exists in its procurement process, see On\u00e9simus Def., LLC , B-411123.3, B -411123.4, July 24, 2015, 2015 CPD \n\u00b6 224 at  5, and not whether the agency\u2019s corrective action remedies the flaws alleged in \na prior protest where no decision on the merits was issued by our Office.  Sealift, Inc. , \nB-412041.2, Dec. 30, 2015, 2016 CPD \u00b6 9 at 4.    \n Here, based on the record presented, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s \nproposed corrective action.  USMC\u2019s judgment that amending the solicitation to include \na provision for price realism as part of its corrective action was necessary to address  \nadditional concerns with  the procurement, is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion and \none that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the agency\u2019s judgment was unreasonable.  As noted, the agency has explained that because of the significant spread between the proposed prices in the initial proposals , \nwhere at least one appeared relatively  low, the contracting officer believ es that some of \nthe initial proposed prices may reflect the offerors \u2019 failure to comprehend the complexity \nand risks associated with the solicited requirements.  The agency also has explained that because the task order will be issued on a fixed- price basis, the agency wants to \navoid a scenario where the selected contractor is unable to perform the contract requirements at the awarded price .  In this regard, amending the solicitation to put \nofferors on notice that USMC will perform a price realism evaluation  would allow the \nagency to address these risks when making its award decision.  \n Our Office has explained that an agency may conduct a price realism evaluation in \nconnection with the issuance of a fixed- price task order for the limited purpose s of \nmeasuring an offeror\u2019s understanding of the solicitation\u2019s requirements  or to assess the \nrisk inherent in an offeror\u2019s proposal.  See , e.g., R3 Gov\u2019t Sols., LLC , B-404863.2,  \nSept. 28, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  284 at  5; Puglia Eng\u2019g of California, Inc. , B-297413 et al. , \nJan. 20, 2006, 2006 CPD \u00b6 33 at  6.  While Catalyst disagrees with the agency\u2019s \njudgment, the protester fails to show that amending the solicitation to includ e a provision \nfor price realism as part of USMC\u2019s proposed corrective action is unreasonable or \notherwise violates appli cable procurement law or regulation.   \n To the extent the protester alleges that amending the solicitation to include a price \nrealism provision and request ing revised price proposals  will cause Catalyst competitive \nharm  because its price has been exposed, we have recognized that the possibility that a \ncontract may not have been awarded based on a fair determination of the most advantageous proposal has a more harmful effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system than does the possibility that a competing offeror w ill be at a \ndisadvantage in a reopened procurement because its price has been exposed.  See \nNorthrop Grumman Info. Tech., Inc ., B-404263.6, Mar.  1, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 65 at 3.  \n Accordingly, under these circumstances, we find the agency\u2019s proposed corrective  \n  Page 6    B-423269.2   actions were a reasonable means of remedying the identified agency concerns to \nensure a fair and impartial competition.  \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel",

Id.    \n Contracting agencies have broad discretion to take corrective action where the agency \ndetermines that such action is necessary to ensure a fair and impartial competition, and, \ngenerally, the details of a corrective action are within the sound discretion and judgment of the contracting agency.

Our Office will not object to any particular corrective action so long as it is \nappropriate to remedy the reasonable concern that caused the agency to take \ncorrective action.

Sealift, Inc. , \nB-412041.2, Dec. 30, 2015, 2016 CPD \u00b6 9 at 4.    \n Here, based on the record presented, we find no basis to object to the agency\u2019s \nproposed corrective action.  USMC\u2019s judgment that amending the solicitation to include \na provision for price realism as part of its corrective action was necessary to address  \nadditional concerns with  the procurement, is a matter within the agency\u2019s discretion and \none that we will not disturb where the protester has failed to demonstrate that the agency\u2019s judgment was unreasonable.  As noted, the agency has explained that because of the significant spread between the proposed prices in the initial proposals , \nwhere at least one appeared relatively  low, the contracting officer believ es that some of \nthe initial proposed prices may reflect the offerors \u2019 failure to comprehend the complexity \nand risks associated with the solicited requirements.  The agency also has explained that because the task order will be issued on a fixed- price basis, the agency wants to \navoid a scenario where the selected contractor is unable to perform the contract requirements at the awarded price .  In this regard, amending the solicitation to put \nofferors on notice that USMC will perform a price realism evaluation  would allow the \nagency to address these risks when making its award decision.  \n Our Office has explained that an agency may conduct a price realism evaluation in \nconnection with the issuance of a fixed- price task order for the limited purpose s of \nmeasuring an offeror\u2019s understanding of the solicitation\u2019s requirements  or to assess the \nrisk inherent in an offeror\u2019s proposal.  See , e.g., R3 Gov\u2019t Sols., LLC , B-404863.2,  \nSept. 28, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6  284 at  5; Puglia Eng\u2019g of California, Inc. , B-297413 et al. , \nJan. 20, 2006, 2006 CPD \u00b6 33 at  6.  While Catalyst disagrees with the agency\u2019s \njudgment, the protester fails to show that amending the solicitation to includ e a provision \nfor price realism as part of USMC\u2019s proposed corrective action is unreasonable or \notherwise violates appli cable procurement law or regulation.   \n To the extent the protester alleges that amending the solicitation to include a price \nrealism provision and request ing revised price proposals  will cause Catalyst competitive \nharm  because its price has been exposed, we have recognized that the possibility that a \ncontract may not have been awarded based on a fair determination of the most advantageous proposal has a more harmful effect on the integrity of the competitive procurement system than does the possibility that a competing offeror w ill be at a \ndisadvantage in a reopened procurement because its price has been exposed.  See \nNorthrop Grumman Info. Tech., Inc ., B-404263.6, Mar.  1, 2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6 65 at 3.  \n Accordingly, under these circumstances, we find the agency\u2019s proposed corrective  \n  Page 6    B-423269.2   actions were a reasonable means of remedying the identified agency concerns to \nensure a fair and impartial competition.  \n \nThe protest is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

The requester argued that the agency\u2019s evaluation of Mission Analytics\u2019s  technical approach \nwas unreasonabl e and the agency\u2019s price analysis was flawed.  We denied the protest \nbecause the record support ed the agency\u2019s  evaluation of Mission Analytics\u2019s quotation \nas technically unaccept able and the agency\u2019s price evaluation of the awardee\u2019s \nquotation as fair and reasonable.   The requester argues that our decision contained \nerrors of fact and law that warrant modification of our prior decision.   \n We deny the request for reconsideration.   \n BACKGROUND  \n The agency issued the solicitation on August 6, 2024, as a small business set -aside, \nunder the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation parts 12 and 13.  Agency  Page 2 B-423198.2  Report (AR), Tab 4, RFQ at 1.1  The RFQ contemplated the award of a fixed- price \nservice contract to upgrade the audio- visual technology of the auditorium used by the \n9th Air Refueling Squadron on Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California.

Award would be made to the \u201c responsible offeror whose offer . . . will be most \nadvantageous\u201d to the government, considering the following evaluation factors:  technical capability and price.  Id.  at 3.  For technical capability, quotations would be \nevaluated as acceptable or unacceptable.  Id.   Price would be evaluated for \nreasonableness .  Id.  \n As relevant here, t he solicitation required the installation of a modernized audio -visual \nsystem , including a 55-inch \u201cconfidence monitor \u201d intended to hang from the ceiling of \nthe auditorium.

In \nthis regard, t he requester asserts  that our decision  \u201cignore[d]\u201d  the allegation that Mission \nAnalytics\u2019s agency -level protest was  improperly dismissed.  Id.   The requester further  \nargues  that our decision erred by affirming the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s  \nevaluation of Mission Analytics\u2019s  quotation as technically unacceptable for not includ ing \na detailed plan to install the confidence monitor .  Id. at 4-6.  Finally, Mission Analytics  \nstates  that our  decision failed to address the requester\u2019s argument that  the agency  \nunreasonably relied on a comparison to a project  that was \u201c not similar in scope \u201d to the \ninstant requirement , when analyzing Thundercat\u2019s price quotation .

For the \nreasons discussed below, we find that none of the arguments presented by the requester provide a basis to grant the request for reconsideration.  \n Under our Bid Protest Regulations, to obtain reconsideration, the requesting party must set out the factual and legal grounds upon which reversal or modification of the decision is deemed warranted, specifying any errors of law made or information not prev iously \nconsidered.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.14(a).

The repetition of arguments made during our consideration of the original \nprotest and disagreement with our decision do not meet this standard.  Id. at 5 -7. \n \nAs an initial matter , Mission Analytics argues that our decision did not acknowledge that \nthe agency erred when it dismissed Mission Analytics\u2019s agency -level protest  as \nuntimely .2  As noted above,  however,  after the agency dismissed the requester\u2019 s \nagency -level protest, Mission Analytics filed a timely protest with our Office.  Our Office \nthen considered and denied Mission Analytics\u2019s protest .  See Mission Analytics  LLC, \nsupra.  By assigning fault to the agency for dismissing the requester\u2019s agency -level \nprotest --and ignoring the fact that our Office considered and denied these same \nallegations  in the subsequent protest filed with our Office--the requester fails to identify \na legal or factual error in our decision supporting reconsideration.   As a result, we \ndismiss this argument . \n \n2 The agency acknowledged, in the agency report filed in response to Mission \nAnalytics\u2019s protest, that it  \u201cerred in determining that the entire agency -level protest was \nuntimely.\u201d  MOL  at 4 n.2.  Nevertheless, the agency explained that \u201cthose timely \nallegations are raised for GAO\u2019s consideration on the merits of the subject protest,\u201d which the agency \u201caddressed [] in its report .\u201d  Id.   \n  Page 4 B-423198.2   \nMission Analytics also argues that the agency improperly evaluated the requester\u2019s \nquotation as  unacceptable for failing to explain where and how Mission Analytics \nintended to install the confidence monitor in the auditorium.  Req. for Recon. at  4-6.  In \nthis regard, the requester  argues that because the agency provided photographic \nexamples of an exi sting confidence monitor mounted in another auditorium, the agency \nshould have understood that Mission Analytics  intended to mount the confidence \nmonitor in the same location,  and in the same manner , as in the solicitation\u2019s reference \nphotos.  See i d. at 4-6.  Mission Analytics raised this same argument in its protes t, \nwhich our Office considered and rejected when we found that the agency reasonably \ndetermined that  Mission Analytics failed to adequately  specify where and how Mission \nAnalytics intended to install the confidence monitor .  See  Protest at 6, 12; Comments \nat 2; Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 4-5.  Neither the requester\u2019 s repetition of its \nprevious argument nor its disagreement with our conclusion provide a basis  for \nreconsideration.   Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  As such, we deny this \nargument.  \n Finally, Mission Analytics contends  that our decision  erred by finding the agency\u2019s price \nevaluation to be reasonable.  Req. for Recon. at 7- 8.  In this regard, the requester  \nopenly repeats  its argument  that the agency\u2019s price analysis  was flawed because the \nagency compared the awardee\u2019s proposed prices  to contract prices for a requirement  \nthe requester maintains was \u201cnot similar in scope, and in fact, was almost exactly twice \nthe scope\u201d of the instant requirement.  Id. at 7.  In the requester\u2019s view, our Office erred \nby not addressing this argument when we concluded that the agency\u2019s price evaluation \nwas reasonable.   Id. at 7 -8.   \n We see no basis to reconsider our prior decision.  First,  we note that  Mission Analytics \nincorrectly implies that our Office ignored or otherwise failed to consider  this challenge \nof the agency\u2019s price evaluation.  Although our decisions may not necessarily address \nevery argument raised, our Office reviews and decides all issues raised by protesters  \nconsistent with our mandate to provide for the \u201cinexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests .\u201d  Gunnison Consulting Grp., Inc. --Recon., B -418876.5, Feb. 4, 2021, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 101 at 5 (quoting 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(a)(1)) .  Accordingly, t he fact that our decision \ndid not address Mission Analytics\u2019s specific argument about the alleged difference in scope between these two requirements does not  mean the argument was not \nconsidered  by our Office.  Nor does the lack of specific discussion provide a basis to \nreconsider our decision.  See Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, B -417161.3, July 11, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 398 at 4 (noting that \u201ca lack of discussion is not indicative of  an error of fact \nor law\u201d).    Second, as noted above, Mission Analytics raised the same argument in the underlying \nprotest.  Compare Comments at 11- 12 with Req. for Recon. at 6- 8.  By repeating this \nargument in its request, Mission Analytics fails to meet our standard for reconsideration.    Page 5 B-423198.2  Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  Accordingly, this argument is likewise \ndenied.3 \n \nThe request is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n3 In any event, we note that our conclusion that the agency\u2019s price evaluation was \nreasonable did not rest exclusively on the comparison between the awardee\u2019s prices to the specific contract that the requester alleges was \u201ctwice the scope\u201d of the requirement being solicited.  Instead,  our decision assessed the agency\u2019s overall price analysis, \nwhich relied on multiple methods, such as comparing the awardee\u2019s price to an independent government cost estimate and to the prices of the quotations submitted in response to the solicitation.  Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 6-7.  Our Office weighed \nthe entire record, and all aspects of the agency\u2019s documented price analysis, and on this basis we concluded that the agency reasonably determined the awardee\u2019s price to be fair and reasonable.

In this regard, the requester  \nopenly repeats  its argument  that the agency\u2019s price analysis  was flawed because the \nagency compared the awardee\u2019s proposed prices  to contract prices for a requirement  \nthe requester maintains was \u201cnot similar in scope, and in fact, was almost exactly twice \nthe scope\u201d of the instant requirement.  Id. at 7.  In the requester\u2019s view, our Office erred \nby not addressing this argument when we concluded that the agency\u2019s price evaluation \nwas reasonable.   Id. at 7 -8.   \n We see no basis to reconsider our prior decision.  First,  we note that  Mission Analytics \nincorrectly implies that our Office ignored or otherwise failed to consider  this challenge \nof the agency\u2019s price evaluation.  Although our decisions may not necessarily address \nevery argument raised, our Office reviews and decides all issues raised by protesters  \nconsistent with our mandate to provide for the \u201cinexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests .\u201d  Gunnison Consulting Grp., Inc. --Recon., B -418876.5, Feb. 4, 2021, 2021 \nCPD \u00b6 101 at 5 (quoting 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(a)(1)) .  Accordingly, t he fact that our decision \ndid not address Mission Analytics\u2019s specific argument about the alleged difference in scope between these two requirements does not  mean the argument was not \nconsidered  by our Office.  Nor does the lack of specific discussion provide a basis to \nreconsider our decision.  See Analytical Sols. by Kline, LLC, B -417161.3, July 11, 2019, \n2019 CPD \u00b6 398 at 4 (noting that \u201ca lack of discussion is not indicative of  an error of fact \nor law\u201d).    Second, as noted above, Mission Analytics raised the same argument in the underlying \nprotest.  Compare Comments at 11- 12 with Req. for Recon. at 6- 8.  By repeating this \nargument in its request, Mission Analytics fails to meet our standard for reconsideration.    Page 5 B-423198.2  Alion Sci. & Tech. Corp. --Recon. , supra at 7.  Accordingly, this argument is likewise \ndenied.3 \n \nThe request is denied.  \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  \n \n3 In any event, we note that our conclusion that the agency\u2019s price evaluation was \nreasonable did not rest exclusively on the comparison between the awardee\u2019s prices to the specific contract that the requester alleges was \u201ctwice the scope\u201d of the requirement being solicited.  Instead,  our decision assessed the agency\u2019s overall price analysis, \nwhich relied on multiple methods, such as comparing the awardee\u2019s price to an independent government cost estimate and to the prices of the quotations submitted in response to the solicitation.  Mission Analytics  LLC, supra at 6-7.  Our Office weighed \nthe entire record, and all aspects of the agency\u2019s documented price analysis, and on this basis we concluded that the agency reasonably determined the awardee\u2019s price to be fair and reasonable.

        "Summary":"Protest challenging the evaluation of the protester\u2019s quotation as technically unacceptable is denied where the agency\u2019s evaluation w as reasonable and consistent \nwith the terms of the solicitation.   \nDECISION  \n Sanitz Enterprises, Inc., a small business of Fredericksburg, Texas, protests the \nissuance of a delivery order to Containment Corporation, a small business of Murrieta, California, under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 1742203, issued by the General Services Administration  (GSA) , Federal Acquisition Service, for steel spill containment \nberms.  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably evaluated its quotation.\n1   \n We deny the protest.  \n  \nBACKGROUND  \n \nOn February 3, 2025, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the \nagency issued the RFQ to vendors holding GSA multiple award schedule contracts with \nSpecial Identification Number  (SIN)  332999P , for spill containment units, containment \n \n1 This protest is not subject to a GAO protective order because Sanitz  opted to proceed \nwithout outside counsel.

More \nspecifically, the RFQ contemplated the issuance of a single firm-fixed -price delivery \norder for 22 steel spill containment berms for Joint Base Lewis -McChord in Washington.  \nId.  The agency explains that Joint Base Lewis -McChord uses drive- in steel \ncontainment systems to prevent hazardous substances from leaking into the \nenvironment.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and Memorandum of Law (COS\/MOL)  \nat 1.   \n The solicitation provided for award on a lowest -priced, technically acceptable basis, \nconsidering the following factors:  technical and price.  RFQ at 26.  With regard to the \nprice factor, the solicitation stated that once evaluators determined a quotation to be technically acceptable, the agency would evaluate the quoted price for fairness and reasonableness.\n2  Id. at 30.  Under the technical factor, the RFQ advised that the \nagency would review vendors\u2019 technical packages on a pass\/fail basis for the completion of a technical compliance document and for the submission of supporting \nliterature demonstrating that vendors\u2019 products \u201c meet all required salient characteristics , \nspecifications , and can deliver at least a portion of the requirement 30 days [a] fter \n[r]eceipt of [o]rder (ARO) and fulfill the rest by 90 days ARO .\u201d  Id. at 26.   \n As relevant here, regarding the brand name or equal requirement for vendors to submit a product meeting all required salient characteristics and specifications, the solicitation\u2019s required documentation included a technical compliance document  for vendors to \ncomplete.  Id. at 30.  This attachment asked vendors to either confirm that their product \nwas the brand name item listed in the solicitation--the Containment Corporation TriStar \nOPS Containment System --or that the product had trilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, \nand the ability to \u201crelocate [the] filtration system on all four corners of the containment system.\u201d  Id.  Finally, the solicitation incorporated the full text of a FAR provision \nconcerning \u201cdescriptive literature,\u201d defined as \u201cinformation furnished by a bidder, such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures, that shows a product\u2019s characteristics or cons truction or explains its operation.\u201d  Id.  at 25; see FAR provision 52.214- 21.  The \nsolicitation cautioned that if \u201cthe descriptive literature fails to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the bid.\u201d  RFQ at 25; see FAR provision 52.214- 21. \n \nTwo vendors, Sanitz and Containment Corporation, submitted quotations by the February 18 closing date for receipt of quotations.\n3  COS\/MOL  at 1.  Containment \nCorporation\u2019s quoted price was $807,000, and Sanitz\u2019s quoted price was $659,999.  Id . \nat 4.

Page 3 B-423374  technical quotation based on its lack of sufficient supporting literature and its failure  to \nprovide a brand name or equal item.4  Id. at 3.  Sanitz did not quote the brand name \ncontainment system and instead quoted an \u201cequal\u201d product  purporting to meet the \ntechnical requirements of the solicitation.  With regard to Sanitz\u2019s failing rating, the \nagency  documented its finding that  Sanitz completed the technical compliance \ndocument --indicating that the equipment offered met the solicitation\u2019s required salient \ncharacteristics --but \u201cdid not provide supporting literature demonstrating that their \nproducts meet all required salient characteristics and specifications. \u201d  AR, Tab E2, \nAward Decision Document at 4.  As relevant here, because the agency found that  \nSanitz\u2019s technical compliance document conflicted with its supporting literature, the agency emailed Sanitz on February 18, prior to award,  with the opportunity to submit \nany clarifications necessary to support its completed technical compliance document  by \nclose of business on February 19.  AR, Tab F8, Email to Sanitz for More Technical Information at 1 .  Specifically, the agency sent the email to the contact listed in Sanitz\u2019s \nquotation and requested further information regarding Sanitz\u2019s product and its compliance with the solicitation\u2019s \u201cor equal\u201d requirements for trilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, and a movable filtration system.  Id .  Sanitz did not respond to this \nemail.\n5  \n The agency evaluated and assigned a passing rating to Containment Corporation\u2019s technical quotation under all factors ; noted that the vendor could deliver all \n22 containment berms within 30 days after receipt of the order ; and further found the \nprice to be fair and reasonable.  COS\/MOL  at 3-4.  On March 5, the agency posted a \nnotice of its award to Containment Corporation on the GSA eBuy website.   Id. at 4.   On \nMarch 7, this protest followed.  \n DISCUSSION  The protester argues that the agency unreasonably assigned its quotation a failing \nrating and asserts that the containment product it offered met all required technical \nspecifications.  Protest at 1.  In support of this argument, Sanitz contends that its submission materials included the completed technical compliance document, which confirmed that its product included the thr ee salient characteristics required for a brand \nname or equal item:  ( 1) trilinear sidewalls, ( 2) fiberglass coating, and ( 3) a filtr ation \nsystem capable of being relocated to all four corners of the containment system.  \nComments at 2; AR, Tab  B4, Sanitz Technical Compliance Document at 1.  The \nprotester also argues the agency should not have considered communications between the agency and the customer for the procurement, Joint Base Lewis -McChord, in \nevaluating the firm\u2019s quotation.  In this context, the protester asserts the customer \n \n4 The agency\u2019s evaluators also noted that Sanitz could deliver 6 of the 22 containment \nberms within 30 days after receipt of the order  and would provide the remaining items \nwithin 90 days .  COS\/MOL  at 3.   \n5 Sanitz asserts that this email was sent to an employee who was out of the office.  \nProtest at 1.    Page 4 B-423374  improperly  raised concerns about the technical specifications of Sanitz\u2019s offered \ncontainment system  based upon an image illustrating that containment system in \nSanitz\u2019s quotation.   Comments at 3.  Ultimately, the protester argues that the agency \nshould not have allowed its reservations concerning Sanitz\u2019s product based on the \nvendor\u2019s supporting literature to influence its evaluation of the protester\u2019s quotation, \ngiven that Sanitz expressly stated its product met the solicitation\u2019s technical specifications  in the submitted technical compliance document.  Id. at 3 -4.   \n The agency responds that Sanitz was responsible for providing all the information \nrequired by the solicitation and argues that Sanitz failed to provide sufficient technical information for the agency to determine that its  containment system  had the three \ncharacteristics required of an \u201cequal\u201d item.  COS\/MOL  at 4.  GSA notes that , as a \ncourtesy,  it gave the protester an opportunity to clarify the technical specifications of its \nproduct on February 18, and the protester did not respond.  Id .  Subsequently, on \nFebruary 20, the agency sent the technical quotations of both vendors to the customer, Joint Base Lewis -McChord, for review.  Id . at 5.   \n The customer reviewed Sanitz\u2019s technical documentation and stated that the image in \nthe supporting literature provided \u201cis just a computer drawing, not an actual containment \nsystem in use in a military environment.\u201d  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11; see AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications.  The customer also explained that the \nimage made it difficult to determine whether the filtration system could be moved to different corners of the containment berm , and whether the container sidewall included \na rubber insert  rather than the required trilinear sidewall .\n6  AR, Tab  F5, Technical \nReview Emails at 11.  In sum, the agency argues that its evaluation of Sanitz\u2019s technical \ndocumentation, including its communications with Joint Base Lewis -McChord, called \ninto question the compliance of the protester\u2019s product with the three salient \ncharacteristics required by the solicitation.  As a result, the agency asserts that it properly determined that Sanitz\u2019s quotation did not meet the RFQ\u2019s requirements.    \nIn reviewing a protest challenging an agency\u2019s  technical evaluation, our Office will not \nreevaluate the quotations ; rather , we will examine the record to determine whether the \nagency \u2019s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

Deloitte Consulting, LLP , B-416882.4,  Jan. 6,  2020,  2020 CPD \u00b6 21 at 6.  A \nvendor risks having its quotation evaluated unfavorably where it fails to submit an adequately  written quotation.   Logmet LLC , supra.   \n We have considered the record and all of the protester\u2019s arguments, including those that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed here, and find no basis to sustain the protest.  We disagree with the protester\u2019s argument that its quotation clearly \naddressed the solicitation\u2019s technical specifications.  The record shows that the solicitation required \u201cequal\u201d containment systems to include certain characteristics:  \ntrilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, and a filtration system capable of being moved to \nany of the containment system\u2019s  four corners.  RFQ at 26, 30.  The record also shows \nthat both GSA and the customer of the procurement at issue, upon review of the graphic Sanitz provided, could not determine with certainty that the offered product met these three technical specifications.  For example, the page in the protester\u2019s quotation with \nthe graphic illustrating the containment system described it as having \u201cupgraded \ncoating.\u201d  AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications at 1.  We note the agency \u2019s \ncontemporaneous statement that Sanitz did not respond to the February 18 email to verify if this \u201cupgraded coating\u201d was a fiberglass coating, as required by the solicitation.  AR, Tab E2, Award Decision Document at 8.  We also note the customer\u2019s concer n that \nthe graphic depicting Sanitz\u2019s containment system  was a computer drawing and \u201cnot an \nactual containment system in use in a military environment ,\u201d and raised questions about \nwhether the system had compliant sidewalls  and a movable filter , as re quired by the \nsolicitation .  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11.   \n While Sanitz  argues that any questions the agency had regarding its product\u2019s \ncompliance with the solicitation should have been resolved by the technical compliance document it completed, we disagree.  Comments at 3 -4.  Sanitz\u2019s completed technical \ncompliance document  \u201cchecked the boxes\u201d for all three salient characteristics required \nby the solicitation.  However, the record shows that the ambiguous nature of the image \nSanitz provided in its quotation called into question the protester\u2019s  ability to comply with \nthe solicitation\u2019s \u201cequal\u201d  product technical specifications.   AR, Tab E2, Award Decision \nDocument at 7.  Specifically, we note the agency\u2019s finding that the literature the \nprotester provided \u201cdid not fully support that the product they are offering meets all of the three salient characteristics required to meet the needs of the [c]ustomer. \u201d  Id.  We \nalso note the RFQ  provided for reviewing submitted supporting literature on a pass\/fail \nbasis and further put vendors on notice that if \u201cthe descriptive literature fail s to show that \nthe product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the bid.\u201d  RFQ at 2 5-26.   \n As a result, we agree that the agency reasonably determined that the protester\u2019s quotation did not clearly demonstrate conformance with the solicitation\u2019s technical \nrequirements .  To the extent the protester  disagrees, it  was Sanitz\u2019s responsibility to \nsubmit an adequately written quotation establishing its technical capability.  See Deloitte  Page 6 B-423374  Consulting, LLP, supra.  The protester\u2019s disagreement with GSA\u2019s judgment does not \nestablish t hat the agency\u2019s judgment was unreasonable.    \n The protest is denied.

The customer also explained that the \nimage made it difficult to determine whether the filtration system could be moved to different corners of the containment berm , and whether the container sidewall included \na rubber insert  rather than the required trilinear sidewall .\n6  AR, Tab  F5, Technical \nReview Emails at 11.  In sum, the agency argues that its evaluation of Sanitz\u2019s technical \ndocumentation, including its communications with Joint Base Lewis -McChord, called \ninto question the compliance of the protester\u2019s product with the three salient \ncharacteristics required by the solicitation.  As a result, the agency asserts that it properly determined that Sanitz\u2019s quotation did not meet the RFQ\u2019s requirements.    \nIn reviewing a protest challenging an agency\u2019s  technical evaluation, our Office will not \nreevaluate the quotations ; rather , we will examine the record to determine whether the \nagency \u2019s evaluation conclusions were reasonable and consistent with the terms of the \nsolicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.

A \nvendor risks having its quotation evaluated unfavorably where it fails to submit an adequately  written quotation.   Logmet LLC , supra.   \n We have considered the record and all of the protester\u2019s arguments, including those that are in addition to, or variations of, those discussed here, and find no basis to sustain the protest.  We disagree with the protester\u2019s argument that its quotation clearly \naddressed the solicitation\u2019s technical specifications.  The record shows that the solicitation required \u201cequal\u201d containment systems to include certain characteristics:  \ntrilinear sidewalls, fiberglass coating, and a filtration system capable of being moved to \nany of the containment system\u2019s  four corners.  RFQ at 26, 30.  The record also shows \nthat both GSA and the customer of the procurement at issue, upon review of the graphic Sanitz provided, could not determine with certainty that the offered product met these three technical specifications.  For example, the page in the protester\u2019s quotation with \nthe graphic illustrating the containment system described it as having \u201cupgraded \ncoating.\u201d  AR, Tab B6, Sanitz Technical Specifications at 1.  We note the agency \u2019s \ncontemporaneous statement that Sanitz did not respond to the February 18 email to verify if this \u201cupgraded coating\u201d was a fiberglass coating, as required by the solicitation.  AR, Tab E2, Award Decision Document at 8.  We also note the customer\u2019s concer n that \nthe graphic depicting Sanitz\u2019s containment system  was a computer drawing and \u201cnot an \nactual containment system in use in a military environment ,\u201d and raised questions about \nwhether the system had compliant sidewalls  and a movable filter , as re quired by the \nsolicitation .  AR, Tab F5, Technical Review Emails at 11.   \n While Sanitz  argues that any questions the agency had regarding its product\u2019s \ncompliance with the solicitation should have been resolved by the technical compliance document it completed, we disagree.  Comments at 3 -4.  Sanitz\u2019s completed technical \ncompliance document  \u201cchecked the boxes\u201d for all three salient characteristics required \nby the solicitation.  However, the record shows that the ambiguous nature of the image \nSanitz provided in its quotation called into question the protester\u2019s  ability to comply with \nthe solicitation\u2019s \u201cequal\u201d  product technical specifications.   AR, Tab E2, Award Decision \nDocument at 7.  Specifically, we note the agency\u2019s finding that the literature the \nprotester provided \u201cdid not fully support that the product they are offering meets all of the three salient characteristics required to meet the needs of the [c]ustomer. \u201d  Id.  We \nalso note the RFQ  provided for reviewing submitted supporting literature on a pass\/fail \nbasis and further put vendors on notice that if \u201cthe descriptive literature fail s to show that \nthe product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the bid.\u201d  RFQ at 2 5-26.   \n As a result, we agree that the agency reasonably determined that the protester\u2019s quotation did not clearly demonstrate conformance with the solicitation\u2019s technical \nrequirements .  To the extent the protester  disagrees, it  was Sanitz\u2019s responsibility to \nsubmit an adequately written quotation establishing its technical capability.

Protests challenging the technical evaluation of first call order are denied where the record shows that the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation.  \n 2.  Protests of the evaluation of the second call order are dismissed where protester\u2019s quotation was technically unacceptable, and, as a result, protester is not an interested party to challenge the agency\u2019s evaluation or issuance of the second call order . \nDECISION  \n Sancorp Consulting, LLC , a small business of Falls Church, Virginia, protests the \nissuance of orders  to Premier Enterprise Solutions, LLC , a small business of Upper \nMarlboro, Maryland, and Arlo Solutions, LLC, a small business of Washington, D.C., under request for quotations  (RFQ) No. HQ003424R0178, issued by the Department of \nDefense, Washington Headquarters Service (WHS) , for technical, administrative, and \nprofessional support services.   The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of \nquotations and the best -value tradeoff decisions for each call order.  \n We deny the protest.  \n DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE  \nThe decision issued on the date below was subject to \na GAO Protective Order.  This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  BACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the RFQ on May 23, 2024, under the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Services -  Business \nServices multiple award schedule contract.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 14, RFQ at 3.\n1  \nThe RFQ, set aside for 8(a) small businesses and issued under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, sought quotations to establish multiple award blanket purchase agreement (BPAs) with vendors to provide technical, administrative, and profess ional support services to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligent & Security (OUSD(I&S)) enterprise.\n2  Id. at 3, 76.  The solicitation anticipated \nestablishing BPAs consisting of a base year and four 1 -year option periods, and \ncontemplated issuing orders against those BPAs on a fixed- price, labor -hour, or time -\nand-materials basis.  Id.  at 3.  The \u201cgood faith estimate amount\u201d for all BPAs is $856 \nmillion.  Id.  \n \nThe RFQ provided a performance work statement (PWS) for the BPA\u2019s general \nrequirements, and specific PWSs for the two initial call orders that would be awarded \nconcurrently with the establishment of the BPAs.  AR, Tab 2a, BPA PWS; AR, Tab 11a, \nCall Order 1 (EXDIR) PWS; AR, Tab 11b, Call Order 2 (SASP) PWS.  Under call \norder  1, the awardee is to provide services to the I&S Executive Directorate (EXDIR).  \nAR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR Call Order PWS at 1.  With call order 2, the awardee will provide \nservices to the Sens itive Activities & Special Programs (SASP) Office.

Call orders would be \nissued individually on a best -value tradeoff basis, considering the following evaluation \nfactors:  (1) technical; (2) past performance; and (3) price.  Id. at 30-31.  The possible \nadjectival ratings for the technical factor were outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, \nand unacceptable.  Id.  at 89- 90.  Past performance would be evaluated and assessed a \nconfidence rating of substantial, satisfactory, neutral, limited, or no, confidence.  Id.  \nat 90-91. \n \nThe technical factor was more important than the past performance factor, and the non-\nprice factors, when combined, were significantly more important than price.

In September, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 1 (EXDIR) to, \nCompr ehensive Approach LLC d\/b\/a Comprehensive Approach Solutions.  COS\/MOL \nat 5.  At the same time, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 2 (SASP) \nto, Sancorp.  Id.  Following notification of the awards, Arlo and Premier filed protests \nwith our Off ice, challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decisions.  Arlo Sols., \nLLC, B-422985, B -422985.2, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision); Premier Enter. \nSols., LLC , B-422985.3, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision).  In response, the agency \nadvised our office that it intended to take corrective action; specifically, the agency stated that it would terminate the BPAs and call orders, reevaluate quotations, and make new award decisions.  Id .  We dismissed the protests as academic on \nOctober  16.  Id. \n The agency summarized the results of the reevaluation as follows:  \n \nCall Order 1 (EXDIR)  Sancorp  Premier  \nTechnical  Good  Outstanding  \nPast performance  Satisfactory Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  \nPrice  $99,312,935  $94,819,501  \n \nCall Order 2 (SASP)  Sancorp  Arlo \nTechnical  Outstanding  Outstanding  \nPast performance  Satisfactory Confidence  Satisfactory Confidence  \nPrice  $91,450,294  $87,748,037  \n AR, Tab 45, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) at 21, 36.\n3  The contracting \nofficer, who was the source selection authority (SSA), determined that WHS would \nestablish BPAs with four vendors, including Sancorp, Premier, and Arlo.  COS\/MOL \nat 6.  Relevant here, the SSA found that Premier\u2019s quotation represented the best value \nfor the EXDIR call order, and that Arlo\u2019s quotation represented the best value for the \nSASP call order, and the agency issued the orders accordingly.  AR, Tab 45, SSDD \nat 35, 45.  This protest followed.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the firm\u2019s quotations for the EXDIR \nand SASP call orders, Premier\u2019s quotation for the EXDIR call order, and Arlo\u2019s quotation \n \n3 The final adjectival rating for Sancorp for the SASP call order is reflected in the \ntechnical evaluation report.  AR, Tab 26,  Sancorp SASP Technical Evaluation Board \n(TEB) Report at 1.

Specifically, the protester contests the agency\u2019s assessment of a weakness in \nSancorp\u2019s quotation under the technical factor for the EXDIR call order and contends \nthat the agency should have identified technical weaknesses in Premier\u2019s quotation.   \nComments & Supp. Protest at 11 -15.  Sancorp also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation \nunder the technical and past performance evaluation factors and the agency\u2019s best -\nvalue tradeoff for the SASP call order.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 8-10, 15- 18.  Although we do not specifically address  every issue raised,  we have \nconsidered all of Sancorp\u2019s arguments , and we find no basis on which to sustain the \nprotest.  \n Call Order 1 (EXDIR)  \n Sancorp\u2019s protest of the EXDIR call order is focused on the agency\u2019s evaluation, under the technical factor, of its own, as well as Premier\u2019s, quotation.   \n  Sancorp\u2019s Quotation \n First, Sancorp contends that the agency \u201cfailed to consider parts of Sancorp\u2019s\u201d technical quotation or \u201cfailed to adequately document the bases for their evaluation conclusions\u201d in assigning a weakness in the evaluation.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13- 15.  The \nagency defends its evaluation of Sancorp\u2019s technical quotation as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  COS\/MOL at 9- 19. \n Under the technical factor, vendors were required to address, among other things, \u201can \neffective method to accomplish the critical tasks identified\u201d from the PWS for the EXDIR \ncall order.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  The RFQ specified three critical task areas for this call order, including task 5.1 (professional, policy, consulting, technical and analytical support).  Id.   Task 5.1 consisted of six support subtasks:  \n(1) legislative research analysis; (2) policy analysis and technical servic es; (3) strategy \nand performance assessments; (4) data analysis; (5) research and business analysis; and (6) all source intelligence analysis.  AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 14 -18. \n The evaluators assessed a weakness in Sancorp\u2019s quotation for its technical approach to this critical PWS task.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 2.  The evaluators found that Sancorp\u2019s quotation met the requirements for five of the six subtasks.  Id. \nat 2-4.  For the research and business analysis subtask, however, the evaluators were \nconcerned that Sancorp\u2019s quotation \u201cspecifically [did] not clearly address the requirements to engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S).\u201d  Id. at 3. \n The evaluation of a vendor \u2019s quotation is a matter within the agency \u2019s discretion.  \nOBXtek, Inc., B -415258, Dec. 12, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  381 at 6.

AllWorld Language Consultants, Inc. , \nB-414244, B -414244.2, Apr. 3, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  111 at 3.  A protester \u2019s disagreement \nwith the agency \u2019s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was \nunreasonable.   Technology & Telecomms. Consultants, Inc. , B-413301, B -413301.2, \nSept. 28,  2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  276 at 4.  \n The protester maintains that the solicitation requires the contractor to \u201cinterface with experts across the Intelligence Community, U.S. Government, and external organizations to expand understanding of critical issues relevant to Great Power Competition, to include travel\u201d and that its quotation addressed this requirement.\n5  See  \nAR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 17.  Sancorp asserts that its quotation \u201cexplained its \napproach to coordination across various stakeholders external to the OUSD(I&S).\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The protester invokes two passages from its quotation that refer to Sanc orp\u2019s work \u201censuring the viability and reliability of the US \nDefense Industrial Base\u201d and \u201chow it had accomplished similar cross -collaboration on \nprior contracts.\u201d  Id.  Alternatively, the protester argues that the evaluators should have \nfound that Sancorp\u2019s approach to a separate subtask --all source intelligence analysis --\nmitigated the effect of failing to address the interface required for research and business analysis.  Id.  at 15.  \n \nThe agency explains that the protester\u2019s quotation--including the paragraphs invoked \nduring the protest --sets forth Sancorp\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d that cross -collaboration is \nrequired, but that the quotation did not actually describe a specific method to \naccomplish this critical task.  COS\/MOL at 14 -15; AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB \nReport at 3 -4 (finding quotation \u201cspecifically does not clearly address the requirements \nto engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S)\u201d).  Although, the agency acknowledged \nthat Sanc orp\u2019s quotation \u201cpartially cover[ed]\u201d an approach to cross -collaboration under \nits response to another subtask (all source intelligence analysis), the evaluators found \nthat this did not entirely mitigate the weakness from the missing detail in Sancorp\u2019s \nquotation.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 3- 4.  According to the \nevaluators, that portion of Sancorp\u2019s quotation only addressed the intelligence \ncommunity rather than the broader universe of stakeholders, and it was \u201cnot clear to the \nGovernment how  Sancorp would fully apply\u201d the approach to research and business \nanalysis.  Id.  at 4.   \n \nAs our decisions have explained, i t is a vendor \u2019s burden to submit a well -written \nquotation with adequately detailed information to meet  the solicitation requirements, and \nto allow for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Innovative M gmt. Concepts, \n \n5 Great Power Competition refers to an era of \u201cintensified U.S. competition with China \nand Russia, as well as challenges by those two countries and others to elements of the \nU.S.-led international order established after World War II.\u201d  Congressional Resear ch \nService, R43848, Great Power Competition:  Implications for Defense--Issues for Congress 38 (2024).

While the \nprotester expresses its opinion that its quotation adequately responded to the \nsolicitation, the evaluators found otherwise, and disagreement with the evaluators \u2019 \nconclusions, without more, provides no reason for us to question the agency \u2019s \nevaluative judgments.  Id.  Further, although the protester asserts that the two cited \nportions of its quotation address the approach to broad- based cross -collaboration that \nthe evaluators determined was missing, Sancorp does not explain how the quotation specified an approach rather than simply reiterating the firm\u2019s claims to experience.   \n Indeed, the only reference to cross -collaboration methods in this part of Sancorp\u2019s \nquotation is not a complete thought:  \u201cTeam Sancorp will cooperate across EXDIR support efforts to ensure that contract support.\u201d  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 20.  Nor does the protester identify any flaw in the evaluators\u2019 conclusion \nthat Sancorp\u2019s specific discussion of interfacing with the intelligence community did not in fact expressly address similar interaction with the broader universe of stakeholders  as \nrequired by the solicitation.  Accordingly, we deny the protester \u2019s challenges to the \nevaluation of a weakness in the firm\u2019s quotation.  See, e.g., CACI, Inc. --Fed. , \nB-420729.2, Mar. 1, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 51 at 9 (denying evaluation challenge where the \nprotester simply held \u201c a different opinion from the evaluators about the information in \n[the protester \u2019s] proposal \u201d); Innovative M gmt. Concepts, Inc. , supra . \n Next, the protester contends that the agency should have assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding, rather than good, to Sancorp\u2019s quotation under the technical evaluation factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10.  According to the protester, WHS was obligated to assign a rating of outstanding to Sancorp\u2019s technical quotation because the \nagency had identified multiple strengths --and only a single weakness --during the \nevaluation.  Id.  \n We have consistently stated that the essence of an agency \u2019s evaluation is reflected in \nthe evaluation record itself, not the adjectival ratings.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , \nB-400670.2, B -400670.3, May 28, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 120 at 9.  Moreover, as a general \nmatter, adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and not a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Science Applications Int \u2019l Corp. , B-407105, B -407105.2, \nNov. 1, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 310 at 9.  The relevant question here is not what adjectival \nrating should have been assigned by the agency, but whether the underlying evaluation is reasonable and supports the source selection decision.  See INDUS Tech., Inc. , \nB-411702 et al. , Sept. 29, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 304 at 4.    \n In support of this challenge, the protester simply quotes the solicitation\u2019s definition of the pertinent adjectival ratings and argues that the strengths assessed to Sancorp\u2019s quotation \u201cclearly aligned with the Outstanding rating criteria in the RFQ, rather than the Good rating that the [evaluators]  assigned Sancorp.\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10. \nThe protester does not otherwise argue why the substance of its quotation merited a higher rating.  In sum, the essence of Sancorp\u2019s challenge is not to the underlying evaluation but to the resulting adjectival rating.  On this record, Sancorp\u2019s disagreement  Page 7 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  with its rating does not provide a basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s evaluation was \nunreasonable.  As such, this challenge is also denied.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , supra.  \n  Premier\u2019s Quotation \n Sancorp also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of Premier\u2019s technical quotation for the EXDIR call order.  According to the protester, the agency \u201cmissed flaws\u201d --failures to \ncomply with material solicitation requirements --in the awardee\u2019s quotation.  Comm ents \n& Supp. Protest at 11- 13.  The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 15 -24.  While we do not \naddress every assertion raised, we have reviewed all the arguments, and we discuss a representative example below.  \n Among the critical tasks identified for the EXDIR call order was PWS task 5.5 (administrative and human resources support).  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  Under this task, subtask 5.5.2 (executive secretariat support), required records \nmanagement liaison support for the \u201cplanning, development, and maintenance of a user-friendly, effective file system compliant with Department regulations.\u201d  AR, \nTab 11a, EXDIR PWS at 29.  This was to include advising on \u201cdigitization\u201d and \nmaintaining \u201cpaperless  archives.\u201d  Id. \n Premier\u2019s quotation addressed the administrative and human resources support task, identifying the following \u201cfour overarching needs\u201d that shaped the firm\u2019s approach for all work, including electronic records:  technical expertise, systems thinking, emotional intelligence, and reality testing.  AR, Tab 27, Premier Technical Quotations at 15- 16.  \nSpecific to the executive secretariat support, Premier acknowledges the need for personnel to have \u201ca holistic sense\u201d of the organization and applicable policies and procedures and discusses how it will apply its approach to records management.  Id.  \nat 17.   \n The protester contends the awardee\u2019s technical quotation fails to demonstrate \u201cexperience in maintaining and posting electronic archives\u201d and does not specifically address National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards for such archives.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13.  The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably found that Premier proposed a comprehensive technical approach to the executive secretariat support work, including electronic archives.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 21-22. \n Here, the record reflects that WHS found that Premier\u2019s quotation met the requirements for this subtask.  AR, Tab 36, Premier EXDIR TEB Report at 5.  According to the evaluators, Premier\u2019s quotation detailed an adequate approach to the work.  Id.  \nAlthough the protester contends that the level of detail provided by Premier was inadequate, nothing in the solicitation required vendors to detail their experience performing similar requirements.  Instead, the RFQ provided that vendors should describe \u201can effect ive method to accomplish the critical tasks\u201d that evidenced \nunderstanding of the work required.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  While  Page 8 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  the protester advocates that the task is better addressed by detailing experience and \nspecifically naming NARA in its response, that opinion does not demonstrate that the awardee\u2019s approach was deficient with respect to meeting the requirements of the PWS.

This argument --and the similar arguments Sancorp \nraises about other elements of the awardee\u2019s quotation--are therefore denied.  \n Call Order 2 (SASP)  \n Sancorp also protests the issuance of the SASP call order to Arlo.  The protester challenges multiple elements of the agency\u2019s evaluation of its own quotation and the quotation of the awardee under the technical and past performance evaluation factors, as well as the reasonableness of the best -value tradeoff.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments \n& Supp. Protest at  8-10, 15- 18.   \n After submission of the agency report, the intervenor, Arlo, filed comments along with a request for dismissal of the protest arguments related to the SASP call order.  Arlo \nargues that the protester\u2019s quotation for this call order is technically unacceptable and cannot form the basis for an award because Sancorp knew that one of its proposed key personnel became unavailable after quotations were submitted, but prior to the agency making award.  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 5- 10.  The agency subsequently file d a \nresponse in support of the intervenor\u2019s request for dismissal.

Instead, the agency has two options:  either reject the quotation  as  Page 9 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  technically unacceptable for failing to meet a material requirement, or open discussions \nwith all remaining vendors  to permit proposal revisions.  Id. \n Here, under the technical factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose individuals for nine key personnel positions including, as relevant here, staff officer (subject matter expert level IV).  RFQ at 87; AR, Tab 11b,  SASP PWS at 5 -6.  Vendors were required to \nsubmit resumes and letters of commitment for the identified key personnel.

AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp submitted X\u2019s resume, which explained that X had joined Sancorp in April 2024 and \u201ccurrently suppor ts OUSD(I&S)\u201d under an incumbent effort.  Id.  Sancorp also submitted a letter of \ncommitment signed by X, in which X agreed to work for Sancorp in the key personnel role in the event of award to the firm.  AR, Tab 51, Sancorp BPA Quotation at 12.  The evaluators assigned a strength to Sancorp\u2019s quotation based on X\u2019s qualifications for \nthe key personnel role.

Our Office directed Sancorp to \nrespond to the intervenor\u2019s request for dismissal.

Supp. Comments at 3; exh. B to Supp. Comment s.  \nSancorp nonetheless contends that it did not have an obligation to inform the agency because the firm did not have actual knowledge of X\u2019s unavailability.  Supp. Comments at 2-3.  Indeed, Sancorp argues:  \n \nEven where employees have resigned, retired, or otherwise left the contractor who proposed them as key personnel, absent notice that the \nemployees were no longer available in case of award, GAO has held that \nno notice to the procuring agency is required.  \n \nId. at 3 (citing DZSP 21, LLC , B-410486.10, Jan. 10, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 155 at 10).  In \nthis connection, the protester asserts that X had \u201cleft Sancorp amicably.\u201d  Id.   According \nto the protester, because X \u201cleft Sancorp on good terms,\u201d only if X affirmatively and specifically withdrew his letter of commitment or otherwise \u201cindicate[d] that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won the award\u201d would Sancorp have had actual \nknowledge of X\u2019s unavailability.  Id.  at 3.  Sancorp hints --without committing --that it \nwould successfully rehire X if it received the SASP task order.  Id. (\u201c[X] did not withdraw  Page 10 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  his letter of commitment or indicate that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won \nthe award . . . and that letter of commitment remains valid to dat e.\u201d). \n Our Office has rejected arguments that a firm had actual knowledge of a proposed key individual\u2019s unavailability where, notwithstanding resignation or retirement of key personnel, the protester advanced a credible basis to deny actual knowledge of unavailability.  For example, in Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422118.2, B -422118.3, \nJuly 30, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 184, we could not conclude that a firm had actual \nknowledge of unavailability of an individual proposed for a key personnel position that was employed by a proposed subcontractor.  There, the firm did not receive direct notification of the individual\u2019s retirement --instead, the subcontractor had separately \nprovided reassurance of the continued availability of the individual.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  In other instances, we did not find actual knowledge of \nunavailability where the proposed individuals themselves have reaffirmed their ongoing availability in statements submitted within the protest record.  See, e.g., DKW \nCommc\u2019ns, Inc. , B-414476,  B-414476.2, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 206 at 9 (finding \nfirm\u2019s \u201cbelief regarding [individual\u2019s] continued availability was a well -founded one, as it \nwas based on information provided by [the individual] himself\u201d).  Similarly, in DZSP 21, LLC, we found no \u201cevidence of an affirmative, material misrepresentation\u201d of the \ncontinued availability of key personnel proposed despite employment changes where documents produced during the protest reflected that (1) the individuals did not advise the offeror of their unavailability (or employment changes); and (2) the individuals \u201call appear interested in assuming the positions for which they had been proposed.\u201d  DZSP 21, LLC , supra at 11- 12. \n \nBy contrast, X was --as touted by Sancorp in its quotation--employed by Sancorp and \nperforming on an incumbent effort at the time of quotation submission.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp itself received specific, direct communicat ion of a significant change in X\u2019s circumstances when X resigned his \nposition with Sancorp on the incumbent effort while quotations were pending.  Supp. Comments at 2; Supp. Comments, exh. B.  That X had signed a letter of commitment in July 2024 when quot ations were submitted, however, does not immunize Sancorp from \nany knowledge of unavailability, and does not provide a permanent and unrebuttable presumption of continued availability despite a change in circumstances.  See  Booz \nAllen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  Here, the record reflects that X submitted a letter of \nresignation on February 7 and subsequently left Sancorp\u2019s employ later that month.  Supp. Comments, exh. B at 1 (resignation letter of X stating, \u201cmy last official day will be 14 February 2025\u201d ).  Relevant here, the protester has not provided any evidence or \nstatement from X, himself, reaffirming his availability or willingness to return to the firm to perform the key position for which he was quoted to perform by Sancorp.  See , DKW \nCommc\u2019ns, Inc. , supra .   Consequently, we find unpersuasive the protester\u2019s argument \nnow that Sancorp lacked \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the employee\u2019s unavailability simply because X did not --after tendering his resignation--also affirmatively withdraw the letter \nof commit ment X had signed months earlier.  See  Ashlin Mgmt.

This redacted version has \nbeen approved for public release.  \n \n  Page 2 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  BACKGROUND  \n \nThe agency issued the RFQ on May 23, 2024, under the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Services -  Business \nServices multiple award schedule contract.  Agency Report (AR), Tab 14, RFQ at 3.\n1  \nThe RFQ, set aside for 8(a) small businesses and issued under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, sought quotations to establish multiple award blanket purchase agreement (BPAs) with vendors to provide technical, administrative, and profess ional support services to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligent & Security (OUSD(I&S)) enterprise.\n2  Id. at 3, 76.  The solicitation anticipated \nestablishing BPAs consisting of a base year and four 1 -year option periods, and \ncontemplated issuing orders against those BPAs on a fixed- price, labor -hour, or time -\nand-materials basis.  Id.  at 3.  The \u201cgood faith estimate amount\u201d for all BPAs is $856 \nmillion.  Id.  \n \nThe RFQ provided a performance work statement (PWS) for the BPA\u2019s general \nrequirements, and specific PWSs for the two initial call orders that would be awarded \nconcurrently with the establishment of the BPAs.  AR, Tab 2a, BPA PWS; AR, Tab 11a, \nCall Order 1 (EXDIR) PWS; AR, Tab 11b, Call Order 2 (SASP) PWS.

At the same time, WHS established a BPA with, and issued call order 2 (SASP) \nto, Sancorp.  Id.  Following notification of the awards, Arlo and Premier filed protests \nwith our Off ice, challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation and award decisions.  Arlo Sols., \nLLC, B-422985, B -422985.2, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision); Premier Enter. \nSols., LLC , B-422985.3, Oct. 16, 2024 (unpublished decision).  In response, the agency \nadvised our office that it intended to take corrective action; specifically, the agency stated that it would terminate the BPAs and call orders, reevaluate quotations, and make new award decisions.  Id .  We dismissed the protests as academic on \nOctober  16.

COS\/MOL \nat 6.  Relevant here, the SSA found that Premier\u2019s quotation represented the best value \nfor the EXDIR call order, and that Arlo\u2019s quotation represented the best value for the \nSASP call order, and the agency issued the orders accordingly.  AR, Tab 45, SSDD \nat 35, 45.  This protest followed.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n The protester challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of the firm\u2019s quotations for the EXDIR \nand SASP call orders, Premier\u2019s quotation for the EXDIR call order, and Arlo\u2019s quotation \n \n3 The final adjectival rating for Sancorp for the SASP call order is reflected in the \ntechnical evaluation report.

Specifically, the protester contests the agency\u2019s assessment of a weakness in \nSancorp\u2019s quotation under the technical factor for the EXDIR call order and contends \nthat the agency should have identified technical weaknesses in Premier\u2019s quotation.   \nComments & Supp. Protest at 11 -15.  Sancorp also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation \nunder the technical and past performance evaluation factors and the agency\u2019s best -\nvalue tradeoff for the SASP call order.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments & Supp. Protest \nat 8-10, 15- 18.  Although we do not specifically address  every issue raised,  we have \nconsidered all of Sancorp\u2019s arguments , and we find no basis on which to sustain the \nprotest.  \n Call Order 1 (EXDIR)  \n Sancorp\u2019s protest of the EXDIR call order is focused on the agency\u2019s evaluation, under the technical factor, of its own, as well as Premier\u2019s, quotation.   \n  Sancorp\u2019s Quotation \n First, Sancorp contends that the agency \u201cfailed to consider parts of Sancorp\u2019s\u201d technical quotation or \u201cfailed to adequately document the bases for their evaluation conclusions\u201d in assigning a weakness in the evaluation.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13- 15.  The \nagency defends its evaluation of Sancorp\u2019s technical quotation as reasonable and consistent with the solicitation.  COS\/MOL at 9- 19. \n Under the technical factor, vendors were required to address, among other things, \u201can \neffective method to accomplish the critical tasks identified\u201d from the PWS for the EXDIR \ncall order.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  The RFQ specified three critical task areas for this call order, including task 5.1 (professional, policy, consulting, technical and analytical support).  Id.   Task 5.1 consisted of six support subtasks:  \n(1) legislative research analysis; (2) policy analysis and technical servic es; (3) strategy \nand performance assessments; (4) data analysis; (5) research and business analysis; and (6) all source intelligence analysis.  AR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 14 -18. \n The evaluators assessed a weakness in Sancorp\u2019s quotation for its technical approach to this critical PWS task.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 2.  The evaluators found that Sancorp\u2019s quotation met the requirements for five of the six subtasks.  Id. \nat 2-4.  For the research and business analysis subtask, however, the evaluators were \nconcerned that Sancorp\u2019s quotation \u201cspecifically [did] not clearly address the requirements to engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S).\u201d  Id. at 3. \n The evaluation of a vendor \u2019s quotation is a matter within the agency \u2019s discretion.  \nOBXtek, Inc., B -415258, Dec. 12, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  381 at 6.

A protester \u2019s disagreement \nwith the agency \u2019s judgment, without more, does not establish that an evaluation was \nunreasonable.   Technology & Telecomms. Consultants, Inc. , B-413301, B -413301.2, \nSept. 28,  2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  276 at 4.  \n The protester maintains that the solicitation requires the contractor to \u201cinterface with experts across the Intelligence Community, U.S. Government, and external organizations to expand understanding of critical issues relevant to Great Power Competition, to include travel\u201d and that its quotation addressed this requirement.\n5  See  \nAR, Tab 11a,  EXDIR PWS at 17.  Sancorp asserts that its quotation \u201cexplained its \napproach to coordination across various stakeholders external to the OUSD(I&S).\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 14.  The protester invokes two passages from its quotation that refer to Sanc orp\u2019s work \u201censuring the viability and reliability of the US \nDefense Industrial Base\u201d and \u201chow it had accomplished similar cross -collaboration on \nprior contracts.\u201d  Id.  Alternatively, the protester argues that the evaluators should have \nfound that Sancorp\u2019s approach to a separate subtask --all source intelligence analysis --\nmitigated the effect of failing to address the interface required for research and business analysis.  Id.  at 15.  \n \nThe agency explains that the protester\u2019s quotation--including the paragraphs invoked \nduring the protest --sets forth Sancorp\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d that cross -collaboration is \nrequired, but that the quotation did not actually describe a specific method to \naccomplish this critical task.  COS\/MOL at 14 -15; AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB \nReport at 3 -4 (finding quotation \u201cspecifically does not clearly address the requirements \nto engage with experts from outside OUSD(I&S)\u201d).  Although, the agency acknowledged \nthat Sanc orp\u2019s quotation \u201cpartially cover[ed]\u201d an approach to cross -collaboration under \nits response to another subtask (all source intelligence analysis), the evaluators found \nthat this did not entirely mitigate the weakness from the missing detail in Sancorp\u2019s \nquotation.  AR, Tab 25, Sancorp EXDIR TEB Report at 3- 4.  According to the \nevaluators, that portion of Sancorp\u2019s quotation only addressed the intelligence \ncommunity rather than the broader universe of stakeholders, and it was \u201cnot clear to the \nGovernment how  Sancorp would fully apply\u201d the approach to research and business \nanalysis.  Id.  at 4.   \n \nAs our decisions have explained, i t is a vendor \u2019s burden to submit a well -written \nquotation with adequately detailed information to meet  the solicitation requirements, and \nto allow for a meaningful review by the procuring agency.

While the \nprotester expresses its opinion that its quotation adequately responded to the \nsolicitation, the evaluators found otherwise, and disagreement with the evaluators \u2019 \nconclusions, without more, provides no reason for us to question the agency \u2019s \nevaluative judgments.  Id.  Further, although the protester asserts that the two cited \nportions of its quotation address the approach to broad- based cross -collaboration that \nthe evaluators determined was missing, Sancorp does not explain how the quotation specified an approach rather than simply reiterating the firm\u2019s claims to experience.   \n Indeed, the only reference to cross -collaboration methods in this part of Sancorp\u2019s \nquotation is not a complete thought:  \u201cTeam Sancorp will cooperate across EXDIR support efforts to ensure that contract support.\u201d  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 20.  Nor does the protester identify any flaw in the evaluators\u2019 conclusion \nthat Sancorp\u2019s specific discussion of interfacing with the intelligence community did not in fact expressly address similar interaction with the broader universe of stakeholders  as \nrequired by the solicitation.  Accordingly, we deny the protester \u2019s challenges to the \nevaluation of a weakness in the firm\u2019s quotation.  See, e.g., CACI, Inc. --Fed. , \nB-420729.2, Mar. 1, 2023, 2023 CPD \u00b6 51 at 9 (denying evaluation challenge where the \nprotester simply held \u201c a different opinion from the evaluators about the information in \n[the protester \u2019s] proposal \u201d); Innovative M gmt. Concepts, Inc. , supra . \n Next, the protester contends that the agency should have assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding, rather than good, to Sancorp\u2019s quotation under the technical evaluation factor.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10.  According to the protester, WHS was obligated to assign a rating of outstanding to Sancorp\u2019s technical quotation because the \nagency had identified multiple strengths --and only a single weakness --during the \nevaluation.  Id.  \n We have consistently stated that the essence of an agency \u2019s evaluation is reflected in \nthe evaluation record itself, not the adjectival ratings.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , \nB-400670.2, B -400670.3, May 28, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 120 at 9.  Moreover, as a general \nmatter, adjectival descriptions and ratings serve only as a guide to, and not a substitute for, intelligent decision- making.  Science Applications Int \u2019l Corp. , B-407105, B -407105.2, \nNov. 1, 2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 310 at 9.  The relevant question here is not what adjectival \nrating should have been assigned by the agency, but whether the underlying evaluation is reasonable and supports the source selection decision.  See INDUS Tech., Inc. , \nB-411702 et al. , Sept. 29, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 304 at 4.    \n In support of this challenge, the protester simply quotes the solicitation\u2019s definition of the pertinent adjectival ratings and argues that the strengths assessed to Sancorp\u2019s quotation \u201cclearly aligned with the Outstanding rating criteria in the RFQ, rather than the Good rating that the [evaluators]  assigned Sancorp.\u201d  Comments & Supp. Protest at 10. \nThe protester does not otherwise argue why the substance of its quotation merited a higher rating.  In sum, the essence of Sancorp\u2019s challenge is not to the underlying evaluation but to the resulting adjectival rating.  On this record, Sancorp\u2019s disagreement  Page 7 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  with its rating does not provide a basis to conclude that the agency\u2019s evaluation was \nunreasonable.  As such, this challenge is also denied.  Stateside Assocs., Inc. , supra.  \n  Premier\u2019s Quotation \n Sancorp also challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of Premier\u2019s technical quotation for the EXDIR call order.  According to the protester, the agency \u201cmissed flaws\u201d --failures to \ncomply with material solicitation requirements --in the awardee\u2019s quotation.  Comm ents \n& Supp. Protest at 11- 13.  The agency responds that its evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 15 -24.  While we do not \naddress every assertion raised, we have reviewed all the arguments, and we discuss a representative example below.  \n Among the critical tasks identified for the EXDIR call order was PWS task 5.5 (administrative and human resources support).  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  Under this task, subtask 5.5.2 (executive secretariat support), required records \nmanagement liaison support for the \u201cplanning, development, and maintenance of a user-friendly, effective file system compliant with Department regulations.\u201d  AR, \nTab 11a, EXDIR PWS at 29.  This was to include advising on \u201cdigitization\u201d and \nmaintaining \u201cpaperless  archives.\u201d  Id. \n Premier\u2019s quotation addressed the administrative and human resources support task, identifying the following \u201cfour overarching needs\u201d that shaped the firm\u2019s approach for all work, including electronic records:  technical expertise, systems thinking, emotional intelligence, and reality testing.  AR, Tab 27, Premier Technical Quotations at 15- 16.  \nSpecific to the executive secretariat support, Premier acknowledges the need for personnel to have \u201ca holistic sense\u201d of the organization and applicable policies and procedures and discusses how it will apply its approach to records management.  Id.  \nat 17.   \n The protester contends the awardee\u2019s technical quotation fails to demonstrate \u201cexperience in maintaining and posting electronic archives\u201d and does not specifically address National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) standards for such archives.  Comments & Supp. Protest at 13.  The agency responds that the evaluators reasonably found that Premier proposed a comprehensive technical approach to the executive secretariat support work, including electronic archives.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 21-22. \n Here, the record reflects that WHS found that Premier\u2019s quotation met the requirements for this subtask.  AR, Tab 36, Premier EXDIR TEB Report at 5.  According to the evaluators, Premier\u2019s quotation detailed an adequate approach to the work.  Id.  \nAlthough the protester contends that the level of detail provided by Premier was inadequate, nothing in the solicitation required vendors to detail their experience performing similar requirements.  Instead, the RFQ provided that vendors should describe \u201can effect ive method to accomplish the critical tasks\u201d that evidenced \nunderstanding of the work required.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 4.  While  Page 8 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  the protester advocates that the task is better addressed by detailing experience and \nspecifically naming NARA in its response, that opinion does not demonstrate that the awardee\u2019s approach was deficient with respect to meeting the requirements of the PWS.   Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422823, B -422823.2, Nov. 18, 2024, 2024 CPD \n\u00b6 272 at 5 (denying protest alleging that awardee should have received weakness \nwhere the protester merely disagreed with the agency\u2019s assessment).  \n To the extent the protester\u2019s objection is that the contemporaneous record includes a very limited examination of Premier\u2019s approach to electronic records, our Office has consistently explained that agencies need not document all determinations of adequacy .  \nAllied Tech. Grp. , Inc., B -412434, B -412434.2, Feb. 10, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 74 at 13 \n(finding an agency is not required to document why a quotation did not receive a weakness for a particular item).  This argument --and the similar arguments Sancorp \nraises about other elements of the awardee\u2019s quotation--are therefore denied.  \n Call Order 2 (SASP)  \n Sancorp also protests the issuance of the SASP call order to Arlo.  The protester challenges multiple elements of the agency\u2019s evaluation of its own quotation and the quotation of the awardee under the technical and past performance evaluation factors, as well as the reasonableness of the best -value tradeoff.  Protest at 26- 32; Comments \n& Supp. Protest at  8-10, 15- 18.   \n After submission of the agency report, the intervenor, Arlo, filed comments along with a request for dismissal of the protest arguments related to the SASP call order.  Arlo \nargues that the protester\u2019s quotation for this call order is technically unacceptable and cannot form the basis for an award because Sancorp knew that one of its proposed key personnel became unavailable after quotations were submitted, but prior to the agency making award.  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 5- 10.  The agency subsequently file d a \nresponse in support of the intervenor\u2019s request for dismissal.  Supp. COS\/MOL at 3- 4.  \nFor the reasons explained below, we find that dismissal is appropriate.  \n  Key Personnel  \n When, as here, a solicitation requires resumes for  key personnel, the resumes form a \nmaterial requirement of the solicitation.  YWCA of Greater Los Angeles , B-414596 et al. , \nJuly 24, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6  245 at 4.  Offerors are obligated to advise agencies of \nchanges in proposed resources to satisfy material requirements, even after submission of proposals  or quotations , including if an individual proposed for a key personnel \nposition is no longer available.  Chenega Healthcare Servs., LLC , B-416158, June 4, \n2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6  200 at  3 n.2.  The duty to notify does not arise, however, if a vendor \ndoes not have actual knowledge of the employee\u2019s unavailability.  Ashlin Mgmt. Grp. , \nB-419472.3, B -419472.4, Nov. 4, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6 357 at 4- 5.  When an agency is \nnotified of the withdrawal of a key person, the agency cannot proceed with award to that quotation.  Id.  Instead, the agency has two options:  either reject the quotation  as  Page 9 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  technically unacceptable for failing to meet a material requirement, or open discussions \nwith all remaining vendors  to permit proposal revisions.  Id. \n Here, under the technical factor, the solicitation required offerors to propose individuals for nine key personnel positions including, as relevant here, staff officer (subject matter expert level IV).  RFQ at 87; AR, Tab 11b,  SASP PWS at 5 -6.  Vendors were required to \nsubmit resumes and letters of commitment for the identified key personnel.  AR, Tab 12a, Call Order Instructions at 7- 8. \n Sancorp proposed an individual who we refer to as \u201cX\u201d for a staff officer key personnel position.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp submitted X\u2019s resume, which explained that X had joined Sancorp in April 2024 and \u201ccurrently suppor ts OUSD(I&S)\u201d under an incumbent effort.  Id.  Sancorp also submitted a letter of \ncommitment signed by X, in which X agreed to work for Sancorp in the key personnel role in the event of award to the firm.  AR, Tab 51, Sancorp BPA Quotation at 12.  The evaluators assigned a strength to Sancorp\u2019s quotation based on X\u2019s qualifications for \nthe key personnel role.  AR, Tab 26, Sancorp SASP TEB Report at 11.  Based, in part, on X and the other key personnel, the evaluators assigned an adjectival rating of outstanding to Sancorp\u2019s quotation.  Id. at 2. \n Citing \u201cpublic information,\u201d the intervenor asserts that in February 2025, X \u201cleft the employment of Sancorp and began working for another company . . . as an Operations Officer\/Research Analyst, rendering X unavailable to fill the key position for which Sancorp proposed him.\u201d  Arlo Req. for Dismissal at 4.  Our Office directed Sancorp to \nrespond to the intervenor\u2019s request for dismissal.  Electronic Protest Docketing System \nNo. 38.   \n In its response, Sancorp confirms that X \u201cresigned from Sancorp in February 2025\u201d and provided a copy of X\u2019s letter of resignation, dated February 7, 2025--before the agency issued the SASP call order at issue.  Supp. Comments at 3; exh. B to Supp. Comment s.  \nSancorp nonetheless contends that it did not have an obligation to inform the agency because the firm did not have actual knowledge of X\u2019s unavailability.  Supp. Comments at 2-3.  Indeed, Sancorp argues:  \n \nEven where employees have resigned, retired, or otherwise left the contractor who proposed them as key personnel, absent notice that the \nemployees were no longer available in case of award, GAO has held that \nno notice to the procuring agency is required.  \n \nId. at 3 (citing DZSP 21, LLC , B-410486.10, Jan. 10, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 155 at 10).  In \nthis connection, the protester asserts that X had \u201cleft Sancorp amicably.\u201d  Id.   According \nto the protester, because X \u201cleft Sancorp on good terms,\u201d only if X affirmatively and specifically withdrew his letter of commitment or otherwise \u201cindicate[d] that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won the award\u201d would Sancorp have had actual \nknowledge of X\u2019s unavailability.  Id.  at 3.  Sancorp hints --without committing --that it \nwould successfully rehire X if it received the SASP task order.  Id. (\u201c[X] did not withdraw  Page 10 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  his letter of commitment or indicate that he was not available to perform if Sancorp won \nthe award . . . and that letter of commitment remains valid to dat e.\u201d). \n Our Office has rejected arguments that a firm had actual knowledge of a proposed key individual\u2019s unavailability where, notwithstanding resignation or retirement of key personnel, the protester advanced a credible basis to deny actual knowledge of unavailability.  For example, in Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , B-422118.2, B -422118.3, \nJuly 30, 2024, 2024 CPD \u00b6 184, we could not conclude that a firm had actual \nknowledge of unavailability of an individual proposed for a key personnel position that was employed by a proposed subcontractor.  There, the firm did not receive direct notification of the individual\u2019s retirement --instead, the subcontractor had separately \nprovided reassurance of the continued availability of the individual.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  In other instances, we did not find actual knowledge of \nunavailability where the proposed individuals themselves have reaffirmed their ongoing availability in statements submitted within the protest record.  See, e.g., DKW \nCommc\u2019ns, Inc. , B-414476,  B-414476.2, June 23, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 206 at 9 (finding \nfirm\u2019s \u201cbelief regarding [individual\u2019s] continued availability was a well -founded one, as it \nwas based on information provided by [the individual] himself\u201d).  Similarly, in DZSP 21, LLC, we found no \u201cevidence of an affirmative, material misrepresentation\u201d of the \ncontinued availability of key personnel proposed despite employment changes where documents produced during the protest reflected that (1) the individuals did not advise the offeror of their unavailability (or employment changes); and (2) the individuals \u201call appear interested in assuming the positions for which they had been proposed.\u201d  DZSP 21, LLC , supra at 11- 12. \n \nBy contrast, X was --as touted by Sancorp in its quotation--employed by Sancorp and \nperforming on an incumbent effort at the time of quotation submission.  AR, Tab 15, Sancorp Technical Quotations at 126.  Sancorp itself received specific, direct communicat ion of a significant change in X\u2019s circumstances when X resigned his \nposition with Sancorp on the incumbent effort while quotations were pending.  Supp. Comments at 2; Supp. Comments, exh. B.  That X had signed a letter of commitment in July 2024 when quot ations were submitted, however, does not immunize Sancorp from \nany knowledge of unavailability, and does not provide a permanent and unrebuttable presumption of continued availability despite a change in circumstances.  See  Booz \nAllen Hamilton, Inc. , supra at 8.  Here, the record reflects that X submitted a letter of \nresignation on February 7 and subsequently left Sancorp\u2019s employ later that month.  Supp. Comments, exh. B at 1 (resignation letter of X stating, \u201cmy last official day will be 14 February 2025\u201d ).  Relevant here, the protester has not provided any evidence or \nstatement from X, himself, reaffirming his availability or willingness to return to the firm to perform the key position for which he was quoted to perform by Sancorp.  See , DKW \nCommc\u2019ns, Inc. , supra .   Consequently, we find unpersuasive the protester\u2019s argument \nnow that Sancorp lacked \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the employee\u2019s unavailability simply because X did not --after tendering his resignation--also affirmatively withdraw the letter \nof commit ment X had signed months earlier.  See  Ashlin Mgmt. Grp. , supra at 5 \n(denying argument that awardee lacked \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of unavailability of individual  Page 11 B-422985.4; B -422985.5  proposed as key personnel --despite individual\u2019s resignation--because individual could \npotentially be rehired).  \n \nAs our decisions have found, because Sancorp had actual knowledge of the unavailability of X, the protester was obligated to advise the agency of the unavailability of the quoted key person, even after submission of  quotations.  Chenega Healthcare \nServs., LLC , supra.  Having failed to do so, Sancorp\u2019s quotation was rendered \nunacceptable and therefore, ineligible for award.\n6  See  Orion Gov\u2019t Servs. , B-422978, \nB-422978.2, Dec. 30, 2024, 2025 CPD \u00b6 15 at 7.  \n \n Interested Party  \n \nUnder the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, only an interested party may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  3551- 3557.

CACI, Inc. -Fed., B-419499, Mar. 16, 2021, 2021 CPD \u00b6  125 at 5.

Page 3 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, using a \nthree- phase advisory down- selection process under which the agency would evaluate \nquotations under the following evaluation factors:  phase one (facility clearance; \ncorporate experience; staffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology \ndemonstration); and phase three (price).5  The RFP further provided that, with the \nexception of the facility clearance factor (which would be rated on a pass\/fail basis), each non- price factor would be assigned a confidence rating of high confidence, some \nconfidence, or low confidence.\n6  Finally, the RFQ provided that, following its evaluation \nof quotations in phase one and phase two, the agency would provide an advisory notice to each vendor reflecting the agency\u2019s recommendation as to whether the vendor should proceed to the next phase.  Id. at 62-63.  The RFQ noted that the purpose of the \nadvisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id. \n In early 2024, the agency received quotations from several vendors including ManTech and Leidos.  During phase one, the agency conducted discussions and provided evaluation notices to ManTech, identifying various aspects of ManTech\u2019s quotation that decreas ed the agency\u2019s confidence under the non- price evaluation factors.  Following \nManTech\u2019s submission of a revised quotation, the agency provided ManTech with a phase one advisory notice, stating that \u201cManTech is not  among the most highly rated \nand the likeli hood of ManTech receiving the award against CLIN 2 is very low.\u201d  AR, \nTab 7-1, Phase One Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Nonetheless, ManTech elected \nto proceed and submitted a phase two quotation.  At the conclusion of the phase two evaluation, the agency again provided ManTech with an advisory notice stating that \nManTech\u2019s quotation was not among the most highly rated and was not likely to receive \naward.  AR, Tab 7-2, Phase Two Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Again, ManTech \nelected to proceed and submitted a phase three quotation.    On September 20, 2024, the agency selected Leidos for award; thereafter, ManTech \nfiled a protest with our Office.  In response, the agency stated that it would take corrective action, to include reevaluating quotations and making a new award decision; acco rdingly, we dismissed the protest.  ManTech Adv anced Sys. Int\u2019l, Inc. , \nB-421560.12, supra.  \n \n5 The RFQ provided that phase one is more important than phase two; phase two is \nmore important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become more similar in \nnature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important in the best -\nvalue t radeoff decision.  RFQ at 61.    \n6 Of relevance here, the solicitation defined a \u201chigh confidence\u201d rating as reflecting a \nquotation that demonstrated understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with \u201clittle or no\u201d government intervention.  The solici tation \ndefined a \u201csome confidence\u201d rating as applicable to a quotation that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with \u201csome\u201d government intervention.  RFQ at 67.    Page 4 B-421560.14; B -421560.16   \nThereafter, the agency reviewed its evaluation of ManTech\u2019s and Leidos\u2019s quotations,7 \nand documented its rationale for assignment of the following ratings:   \n \n ManTech  Leidos  \nCorporate Experience  Some Confidence  High Confidence  \nStaffing Approach  Some Confidence  High Confidence  \nDemonstration  Low Confidence  High Confidence  \nTotal Evaluated Price  $128,467,487  $137,696,324  \nPrice Complete, Reasonable, and \nRealistic  Yes Yes \n AR, Tab  8, Basis of Award at  8. \n In assessing ratings of some confidence to ManTech\u2019s quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors, and low confidence under the demonstration factor, the agency identified multiple aspects of ManTech\u2019s quotation that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence in ManTech\u2019s successful task order performance.  For example, with regard to the corporate experience factor, the agency concluded that ManTech\u2019s quotation \u201clacked details,\u201d provided \u201cno examples of actually utilizing SAFe Agile processes,\u201d and \u201cdid not demonstrate a mature understanding of the SAFe \nframework.\u201d\n8  Id. at 9.  With regard to staffing approach, the agency noted, among other \nthings, that ManTech\u2019s quotation \u201clacked the SAFe specific detail (not just buzz words)\u201d and \u201cmerely placed SAFe terminology on an already existing process.\u201d  Id. at 11.  The \nagency further noted that ManTech\u2019s quotation \u201cfocus[ed] on incumbent capture for the first [redacted]  days [of the transition period]\u201d and \u201c[did not] outline[] recruitment \nactivities [for external hires]\u201d until the last  [redacted]  days of the transition period, \ndescribing this as a \u201creactive approach to staffing and transition which introduces significant risk.\u201d\n9  Id.  Finally, in assigning a low confidence rating under the \n \n7 After numerous protests and corrective actions, ManTech and Leidos were the only \ntwo companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  2 task order.  AR, Tab 8, \nBasis of Award at  2-3.  Both vendors passed the facility clearance factor, which, as \nnoted above, was evaluated on a pass\/fail basis.  Id.  at 4. \n8 To demonstrate corporate experience, the RFQ required vendors to submit \ninformation for three contracts that \u201care similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this RFQ and corresponding CLIN,\u201d and \u201cprovide clear evidence that the Quoter delivered systems or solutions to an external customer utilizing the SAFe framework.\u201d  RFQ at  54. \n9 For the staffing approach factor, the RFQ required vendors to provide a \u201cdetailed \nrationale for how its quoted staffing approach meets the [task order] requirements\u201d and to \u201cinclude the Quoter\u2019s methodologies and capabilities to recruit and retain employees for this effort.\u201d  RFQ at 54.  More specifically, the RFQ stated:  \u201cIf the Quoter\u2019s transition \n(continued...)   Page 5 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  demonstration factor, the agency concluded, among other things, that ManTech \u201cfailed \nto provide an actual demonstration of an 8- 12 week prototype as required.\u201d10  Id. at 13.   \n Overall, the agency\u2019s evaluation authority considered and compared the quotations, concluding:  \u201cEven though ManTech\u2019s solution is lower priced, the Government \ndetermined the lower price is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach \nand ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.\u201d  Id.  at 15. \n \nOn January 24, 2025, the agency again selected Leidos for award, notified ManTech of \nits decision, and provided a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 9, Unsuccessful Vendor Notice \nat 1-2.  This protest followed.\n  \n DISCUSSION  As noted above, ManTech asserts that the terms of the solicitation no longer reflect the agency\u2019s requirements and should be amended, and that the agency improperly assigned ratings of only \u201csome confidence\u201d to ManTech\u2019s quotation under the corporate exper ience and staffing approach evaluation factors.  As discussed below, we dismiss \nManTech\u2019s challenge to the terms of the solicitation, and we deny its allegations regarding the evaluation of its quotation.\n11 \n Terms of Solicitation  \n \nWe first address ManTech\u2019s assertion that the terms of the solicitation fail to reflect the \nagency\u2019s actual needs.  Specifically, ManTech refers to the issuance of a presidential \nmemorandum dated January 20, 2025, along with subsequent guidance from the Of fice \nof Personnel Management, which addresses return to in- person work requirements for \nfederal government employees in the executive branch.\n12  ManTech asserts that these \n \napproach is \u2018incumbent capture,\u2019 the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if \nincumbent capture is not successful.\u201d  Id. at 55; see also id. at 8-9 (staffing and \ntransition staffing requirements).  The RFQ provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor\u2019s approach.  Id.  at 64. \n10  In its protest, ManTech initially asserted that its quotation should have been rated \nhigher under each of these three evaluation factors --but subsequently withdrew its \nprotest regarding the low confidence rating it received under the demonstration factor .  \nSupp. Comments at  2 n.2.    \n11 In its various protest submissions, ManTech raises arguments that are in addition to, \nor variations of, those specifically discussed below.  We have considered all of ManTech\u2019s arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  \n12 The full text of the presidential memorandum states:  \u201cHeads of all departments and \nagencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in -person at their respective duty stations on a full -time basis, provided \n(continued...)   Page 6 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  actions \u201cdrastically altered\u201d the agency\u2019s requirements for this procurement and, \naccordingly, asserts that the agency was required to amend the solicitation--and allow offerors to submit revised quotations.  Protest at 21.   \n   \nManTech acknowledges that the return to in- person work requirements do not apply to \ncontractors, see Protest at 22 n.8, and ManTech\u2019s protest does not identify any \nparticular contract performance requirement that will be altered by the presidential memorandum.  Nonetheless, referencing its contract performance prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, ManTech makes the general assertion that coordination between \ncontractor and government personnel \u201cis best accomplished by co- locating the \nmembers of these teams --both federal and contractor alike--at the FBI\u2019s facility in \nClarksburg, [West Virginia] . . . which the Agency will be required to consider when implementing its in- office policies.\u201d  Id. at 22.   \n In response to this allegation, the agency first states that it did, in fact, consider place of performance requirements when drafting the RFQ, and established on- site \nrequirements for certain contractor personnel.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see RFQ \nat 15.  The agency further points out that ManTech\u2019s protest fails to identify any \nparticular contract performance requirement that will be materially altered by the return to in-person work requirement for government personnel.  Finally, the agency notes that \nthe solicitation expressly provides that the agency may subsequently change work locations for contractor personnel where appropriate.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see \nRFQ at  15.  Accordingly, the agency maintains that ManTech\u2019s general assertion of \nchanged contractor requirements that allegedly flow from the presidential memorandum, without more, is insufficient to form a valid basis for protest.  We agree.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations provide that a protest must include a detailed statement of \nthe legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.1(c)(4), 21.1(f), and 21.5(f).  These requirements contemplate \nthat a protester will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if \nuncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  Midwest Tube Fabricators, Inc. , B-407166, B -407167, Nov. 20, \n2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 324 at 3.  \n Here, ManTech\u2019s general assertion that in- person work requirements for federal \nemployees will impact the contract requirements --without identification of any particular \nmaterial impact on the contract requirements and contractor\u2019s performance--fails to meet the required standard.  First, as discussed above, the solicitation incorporates the agency\u2019s consideration of on- site performance requirements for certain contractor \npersonnel, and further provides that the agency may change work location requirements for contractor personnel as appropriate.  Second, ManTech\u2019s protest fails to \nmeaningfully address how the executive actions will affect this task order\u2019s requirements \n \nthat the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.\u201d  Presidential Memorandum, Return to In -Person Work , 90 Fed. Reg. 8251 (Jan.  28, 2025).   Page 7 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  to acquire agile teams for the delivery of digital and information technology services to \nthe FBI\u2019s CJIS; rather, ManTech\u2019s allegation rests entirely on its purported belief that co-location is the \u201cbest\u201d way to perform the work.  Protest at  22.  Finally, as the agency \npoints out and ManTech acknowledges, the presidential memorandum and accompanying guidance address remote work arrangements for federal government employees in the executive branch; neither \u201creferences contractors or contractor performance at  all.\u201d  Req. for Dismissal at  3. \n In short, ManTech has failed to identify the specific circumstances presented by the presidential memorandum --in the context of this procurement --that could be construed \nto constitute \u201ca material departure from the assumptions set forth in the solicitation.\u201d  See Chronos Sols. , LLC,  et al. , B-417870.2 et al. , Oct. 1, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  395 at  14 \n(sustaining protest where agency did not consider significant changes in the law, as well as agency\u2019s policies and market conditions, directly applicable to the subject matter of the procurement).  On this record, ManTech\u2019s allegation is insufficient and is dismissed.    Evaluation Challenges  \n Next, ManTech challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of its quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors.\n13  Based on these alleged \nevaluation errors, ManTech also challenges the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff decision.  \n \nCorporate Experience Factor  \n \nFor the corporate experience factor, the agency assigned ManTech a rating of \u201csome \nconfidence\u201d and found four aspects of the quotation that decreased the agency\u2019s \nconfidence in ManTech\u2019s successful performance of the task order.  ManTech\u2019s protest \nexpresses its disagreement with each of the four assessments.   \n For example, with regard to ManTech\u2019s third example of its prior experience, the agency \nconcluded that, even following discussions, ManTech\u2019s quotation failed to reflect \nexperience that was \u201csimilar in size and scope\u201d to the task order requirements.\n14  AR, \nTab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at 5.  More specifically, the \nagency noted a lack of detail in the quotation\u2019s description of prior tasks, stating that the prior effort appeared to be \u201cmore of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) effort rather \n \n13 As noted above, ManTech initially challenged--and subsequently withdrew --its \nchallenge to the agency\u2019s assignment of a low confidence rating under the demonstration evaluation factor.  See Supp. Comments at 2 n.2.  \n14 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to submit information for three contracts \nthat \u201care similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity\u201d to the solicitation requirements.  RFQ at  54.  Page 8 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  than a combination of development, test, integration and O&M\u201d.15  Id.  In this context, \nManTech expresses its disagreement with the agency\u2019s assessments, maintaining that \nits revised quotation \u201cprovided specific details\u201d and asserting that the agency\u2019s evaluation was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d  Protest at  28-29.  Alternatively, ManTec h asserts that \nthe agency\u2019s discussions were \u201cinadequate and misleading\u201d because, in ManTech\u2019s \nview, \u201cit is inexplicable how the Agency could have maintained those criticisms to begin \nwith in the face of the revisions to ManTech\u2019s proposal.\u201d  Supp. Comments at  2; Protest \nat 28. \n \nThe agency responds that it properly concluded, following discussions, that ManTech\u2019s \nrevised quotation continued to contain inadequate detail to demonstrate that the prior \neffort encompassed the scope of the required activities, reiterating its view that \nManTech\u2019s description of the prior effort reflected primarily O&M activities.  COS at 11.  More specifically, the agency provides a list of task descriptions drawn from ManTech\u2019s quotation, stating:   \n \nManTech provided the below tasks performed in [its prior contract] which were the bulk of tasks and are clearly O&M activities.  Examples of O&M include . . . training, monitoring administration, and operational support which often requires development of upgrade\/enhancements to current system function, development of dashboards to monitor performance, security, workflow, etc. for system and subsystem components reports, and deployment of a developed system.   \n Id.  In short, the agency maintains that, based on the specific examples drawn from \nManTech\u2019s revised quotation, the agency reasonably concluded that the prior effort was \u201clargely O&M experience and fail[s] to meet the solicitation requirements.\u201d  Id.   \n In responding to ManTech\u2019s complaint regarding the adequacy of discussions, the agency notes that one of the four evaluation notices provided to ManTech contained the following statements:  \n \n[ManTech\u2019s quotation regarding] corporate experience failed to demonstrate . . . a mature understanding of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles and practices which would require some Government intervention to successfully deliver the requirements.  \n \n    *     *     *     *     * \n[The prior contract] was more of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) example rather than the development, test, integration and O&M requirements of the [task order at issue].   \n \n \n15 The task order requirements \u201c[are] comprised of four key areas[:]  development, \ntesting, integration and O&M.\u201d  AR, Tab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation at 5; see RFQ \nat 4-10; see generally  AR, Tab 3- 2, RFQ attach. 2, Statement of Work.     Page 9 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  See AR, Tab 4 -1, Evaluation Notice at 1, 3.  In this regard, the agency argues that it \nproperly and sufficiently advised ManTech of its concerns.  Supp. MOL at  7-8. \n \nWhere, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our Office \nwill not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 58 \nat 8.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with a procuring agency\u2019s evaluation judgments, \nwitho ut more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.  DEI Consulting , \nB-401258, July 13, 2009, 2009 CPD \u00b6 151 at  2.   \n Further, where, as here,  a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, there \nis no requirement for agencies to conduct discussions in accordance with FAR  section \n15.306.  However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in FAR part 8 procurements, \nlike all other aspects of such procurements, must be fair and equitable.  USGC Inc. , \nB-400184.2 et al. , Dec.  24, 2008, 2009 CPD \u00b6 9 at 3.  When an agency engages in \ndiscussions with an offeror, the discussions must be \u201cmeaningful,\u201d that is, sufficiently detailed so as to lead an offeror into the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or \nrevision.  See  FAR 15.306(d)(3); Southeastern Kidney Council , B-412538, Mar. 17, \n2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  90 at 4.  Agencies, however, are not required to \u201cspoon- feed\u201d an \nofferor during discussions by identifying every possible area where a proposal might be improved or suggesting alternative approaches.  Vizada Inc. , B-405251 et al. , Oct. 5, \n2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6  235 at  11. \n \nHere, the record shows that, following discussions, ManTech revised its quotation by inserting the words \u201cdevelopment, test, integration, and operations support,\u201d deleting one task that used the word \u201cO&M,\u201d and adding several tasks descriptions.  AR, Tab 5-1, ManTech Phase One Quotation at  12; see also Comments and Supp. Protest \nat 9 (showing track changes).  After evaluating ManTech\u2019s revised quotation, the \nagency found that its concerns were not resolved and identified this as a decreased confidence area.   AR, Tab  6-1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at  5.  As \nthe contracting officer explains, the information added to ManTech\u2019s quotation was still \u201cclearly O&M activit[y]\u201d and failed to meet the solicitation\u2019s requirements to address the various  elements of SAFe framework.  COS at 11.  \n Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation of ManTech\u2019s quotation under the corporate experience factor or the adequacy of the discussions.  In revising its quotation, ManTech inserted various words and deleted the task that specifically referenced O&M --but, in evaluating the revised quotation, the \nagency considered the entirety of the quotation and found that it still did not address development, test, integration and O&M.  In our view, the agency reasonably concluded that ManTech\u2019s revised quotation still failed to meaningfully address the solicitation requirements and the agency\u2019s concerns raised during discussions.  Moreover, the plain language of the agency\u2019s evaluation notice identified the aspects of ManTec h\u2019s \nquotation that needed to be addressed to include the agency\u2019s express concern that  Page 10 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  ManTech\u2019s experience reflected O&M work rather than the broader requirement s of the \ntask order.  ManTech\u2019s various expressions of disagreement, without more, are \ninsufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  \n \nStaffing Approach Factor  \n For the staffing approach factor, the agency assigned ManTech\u2019s quotation a rating of \u201csome confidence,\u201d and found six areas that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence in ManTech\u2019s successful task order performance.  ManTech\u2019s protest expresses its disagreement with each of the assessments.   \n For example, the agency criticized ManTech\u2019s focus on hiring of incumbent staff at the beginning of the transition period, and its failure to begin recruiting external hires until after the first [redacted]  days, describing this as a \u201creactive approach to staffing and \ntransition that introduces significant risk.\u201d\n16  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 11; see AR \nTab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing Approach) at 3- 4.  ManTech acknowledges \nthat its quotation stated that, following the first [redacted] days of the transition period, \nManTech would \u201c[c]onduct internal and external hiring and outreach events (if needed),\u201d see AR, Tab 5- 1, ManTech Quotation at 22, but nonetheless, asserts that the agency\u2019s \nconcern was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d  Protest at 31.  \n The agency defends its assessment on the basis that ManTech\u2019s quotation indicated it would delay recruitment activities for external hires until after the first portion of the transition period had passed, concluding that ManTech\u2019s focus on incumbent capture \nrather than \u201csimultaneously\u201d conducting external recruitment activities created risk that \ncould \u201cdisrupt work.\u201d  COS at 13- 14; see AR, Tab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing \nApproach) at 3- 4.  More specifically, the agency notes that ManTech\u2019s delayed \napproach to recruiting external hires could \u201ccreate a security backlog and place a significant strain on the onboarding process.\u201d  COS at 13- 14. \n As noted above, our Office will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s \nevaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , supra.   \n \nHere, ManTech acknowledges the agency\u2019s \u201ccorrect\u201d reading of its quotation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  10-11.  While ManTech contends that the agency \n\u201cignored\u201d other \u201cpre- transition recruitment activities\u201d in its quotation, id. , the protester \ndoes not explain how this addressed the RFQ\u2019s transition requirements or mitigated the \n \n16 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to discuss their proposed \u201cmethodologies \nand capabilities to recruit and retain employees\u201d; stated that \u201c[i]f the Quoter\u2019s transition approach is \u2018incumbent capture\u2019, the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if incumbent capture is not successful\u201d; and provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor\u2019s approach.  RFQ at 54- 55, 64.   Page 11 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  agency\u2019s concerns about recruiting delays during transition.  For example, ManTech\u2019s \nquotation indicated it had [redacted] , but these activities were limited to the time period \nleading up to a possible task order award and not during transition.  See  AR, Tab  5-1, \nManTech Phase One Quotation at  21.  These aspects of the quotation do not address \nManTech\u2019s decision to wait until [redacted]  days into the transition period to address \nstaffing if incumbent capture was not successful.  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s concerns regarding the potential risks associated with ManTech\u2019s staffing approach.  This protest ground is denied.  \n Best-Value Tradeoff Decision  \n \nFinally, ManTech challenges the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff decision \u201cbased upon an \nimproper evaluation.\u201d  Protest at 37.  To the extent this complaint is based on \nManTech\u2019s various allegations that we have rejected, the protest fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See , e.g., CORE O\u2019Ahu, LLC, B -421714, B -421714.2, Aug. 31, 2022, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 212 at 11.  In any event, the record shows that the agency considered the detailed evaluation documentation, compared the competing quotations, and concluded:  \u201cEven though ManTech\u2019s solution is lower priced, the Government determined the lower \nprice is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach and ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.\u201d  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award \nat 15.

ManTech also complains that the agency misevaluated its \nquotation under two evaluation factors.      We dismiss the protest in part and deny it in part.  \n BACKGROUND  \n On August 23, 2022, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.4, the agency issued the RFQ to vendors holding General Services Administration, Multiple Award Schedule contracts under Special Identification Number 54151S for information technology professional services.  See  Agency Report (AR), Tab 3- 1, RFQ amend. 13 \n(RFQ).\n2  The solicitation sought quotations to provide agile teams, each comprised of \nthree to eleven individuals, to deliver digital and information technology services for the \nFBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division (CJIS).3  The RFQ contemplated \nissuance of five task orders (collectively referred to as \u201cFBI Agility with SAFe Teams\u201d or \n\u201cFAST\u201d) --one task order for each of five areas within the FBI\u2019s CJIS that are supported \nby this procurement; each task order was identified by  a separate contract line item \nnumber (CLIN).4  This protest concerns only the task order issued under CLIN 2, \nbiometric services.  RFQ  at 5.  The period of performance for the task order includes a \nbase period of one year (including a 3- month transition period) and four 12- month \noption periods.

References to the RFQ are to the \nfinal conformed solicitation provided by the agency that is dated April  25, 2024.  All \ncitations are to the Adobe PDF page numbers of the documents referenced in this \ndecision.  \n3 The RFQ explains that an agile team is a \u201ccross -functional group of individuals who \ndefine, build, test, and deliver an increment of value,\u201d and that these teams will apply a \u201cScaled Agile Framework \u201d (SAFe), which is \u201can enterprise agility framework that helps \norganizations apply lean and agile principles and practices at all levels of the organization.\u201d  RFQ at  4-5. \n4 The five CLINs were for:  (1) law enforcement support services; (2) biometric services; \n(3) National Crime Information Center; (4) shared services; and (5) operational programs.  The agency states that CLIN  4 has been canceled.  Contracting Officer\u2019s \nStatement (COS) at  1 n.1.   Page 3 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  The RFQ provided that award would be made on a best -value tradeoff basis, using a \nthree- phase advisory down- selection process under which the agency would evaluate \nquotations under the following evaluation factors:  phase one (facility clearance; \ncorporate experience; staffing approach); phase two (SAFe agile methodology \ndemonstration); and phase three (price).5  The RFP further provided that, with the \nexception of the facility clearance factor (which would be rated on a pass\/fail basis), each non- price factor would be assigned a confidence rating of high confidence, some \nconfidence, or low confidence.\n6  Finally, the RFQ provided that, following its evaluation \nof quotations in phase one and phase two, the agency would provide an advisory notice to each vendor reflecting the agency\u2019s recommendation as to whether the vendor should proceed to the next phase.  Id. at 62-63.  The RFQ noted that the purpose of the \nadvisory notice was to minimize quotation development costs, and vendors could choose to proceed to the next phase regardless of the recommendation received in the advisory notice.  Id. \n In early 2024, the agency received quotations from several vendors including ManTech and Leidos.  During phase one, the agency conducted discussions and provided evaluation notices to ManTech, identifying various aspects of ManTech\u2019s quotation that decreas ed the agency\u2019s confidence under the non- price evaluation factors.  Following \nManTech\u2019s submission of a revised quotation, the agency provided ManTech with a phase one advisory notice, stating that \u201cManTech is not  among the most highly rated \nand the likeli hood of ManTech receiving the award against CLIN 2 is very low.\u201d  AR, \nTab 7-1, Phase One Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Nonetheless, ManTech elected \nto proceed and submitted a phase two quotation.  At the conclusion of the phase two evaluation, the agency again provided ManTech with an advisory notice stating that \nManTech\u2019s quotation was not among the most highly rated and was not likely to receive \naward.  AR, Tab 7-2, Phase Two Advisory Down Select Notice at  1.  Again, ManTech \nelected to proceed and submitted a phase three quotation.    On September 20, 2024, the agency selected Leidos for award; thereafter, ManTech \nfiled a protest with our Office.  In response, the agency stated that it would take corrective action, to include reevaluating quotations and making a new award decision; acco rdingly, we dismissed the protest.  ManTech Adv anced Sys. Int\u2019l, Inc. , \nB-421560.12, supra.  \n \n5 The RFQ provided that phase one is more important than phase two; phase two is \nmore important than phase three; and, as the non- price ratings become more similar in \nnature, the price evaluated in phase three would become more important in the best -\nvalue t radeoff decision.  RFQ at 61.    \n6 Of relevance here, the solicitation defined a \u201chigh confidence\u201d rating as reflecting a \nquotation that demonstrated understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with \u201clittle or no\u201d government intervention.  The solici tation \ndefined a \u201csome confidence\u201d rating as applicable to a quotation that demonstrated an understanding of the requirements and would likely result in successful performance with \u201csome\u201d government intervention.  RFQ at 67.    Page 4 B-421560.14; B -421560.16   \nThereafter, the agency reviewed its evaluation of ManTech\u2019s and Leidos\u2019s quotations,7 \nand documented its rationale for assignment of the following ratings:   \n \n ManTech  Leidos  \nCorporate Experience  Some Confidence  High Confidence  \nStaffing Approach  Some Confidence  High Confidence  \nDemonstration  Low Confidence  High Confidence  \nTotal Evaluated Price  $128,467,487  $137,696,324  \nPrice Complete, Reasonable, and \nRealistic  Yes Yes \n AR, Tab  8, Basis of Award at  8. \n In assessing ratings of some confidence to ManTech\u2019s quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors, and low confidence under the demonstration factor, the agency identified multiple aspects of ManTech\u2019s quotation that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence in ManTech\u2019s successful task order performance.  For example, with regard to the corporate experience factor, the agency concluded that ManTech\u2019s quotation \u201clacked details,\u201d provided \u201cno examples of actually utilizing SAFe Agile processes,\u201d and \u201cdid not demonstrate a mature understanding of the SAFe \nframework.\u201d\n8  Id. at 9.  With regard to staffing approach, the agency noted, among other \nthings, that ManTech\u2019s quotation \u201clacked the SAFe specific detail (not just buzz words)\u201d and \u201cmerely placed SAFe terminology on an already existing process.\u201d  Id. at 11.  The \nagency further noted that ManTech\u2019s quotation \u201cfocus[ed] on incumbent capture for the first [redacted]  days [of the transition period]\u201d and \u201c[did not] outline[] recruitment \nactivities [for external hires]\u201d until the last  [redacted]  days of the transition period, \ndescribing this as a \u201creactive approach to staffing and transition which introduces significant risk.\u201d\n9  Id.  Finally, in assigning a low confidence rating under the \n \n7 After numerous protests and corrective actions, ManTech and Leidos were the only \ntwo companies remaining in the competition for the CLIN  2 task order.  AR, Tab 8, \nBasis of Award at  2-3.  Both vendors passed the facility clearance factor, which, as \nnoted above, was evaluated on a pass\/fail basis.  Id.  at 4. \n8 To demonstrate corporate experience, the RFQ required vendors to submit \ninformation for three contracts that \u201care similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this RFQ and corresponding CLIN,\u201d and \u201cprovide clear evidence that the Quoter delivered systems or solutions to an external customer utilizing the SAFe framework.\u201d  RFQ at  54. \n9 For the staffing approach factor, the RFQ required vendors to provide a \u201cdetailed \nrationale for how its quoted staffing approach meets the [task order] requirements\u201d and to \u201cinclude the Quoter\u2019s methodologies and capabilities to recruit and retain employees for this effort.\u201d  RFQ at 54.  More specifically, the RFQ stated:  \u201cIf the Quoter\u2019s transition \n(continued...)   Page 5 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  demonstration factor, the agency concluded, among other things, that ManTech \u201cfailed \nto provide an actual demonstration of an 8- 12 week prototype as required.\u201d10  Id. at 13.   \n Overall, the agency\u2019s evaluation authority considered and compared the quotations, concluding:  \u201cEven though ManTech\u2019s solution is lower priced, the Government \ndetermined the lower price is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach \nand ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.\u201d  Id.  at 15. \n \nOn January 24, 2025, the agency again selected Leidos for award, notified ManTech of \nits decision, and provided a brief explanation.  AR, Tab 9, Unsuccessful Vendor Notice \nat 1-2.  This protest followed.\n  \n DISCUSSION  As noted above, ManTech asserts that the terms of the solicitation no longer reflect the agency\u2019s requirements and should be amended, and that the agency improperly assigned ratings of only \u201csome confidence\u201d to ManTech\u2019s quotation under the corporate exper ience and staffing approach evaluation factors.  As discussed below, we dismiss \nManTech\u2019s challenge to the terms of the solicitation, and we deny its allegations regarding the evaluation of its quotation.\n11 \n Terms of Solicitation  \n \nWe first address ManTech\u2019s assertion that the terms of the solicitation fail to reflect the \nagency\u2019s actual needs.  Specifically, ManTech refers to the issuance of a presidential \nmemorandum dated January 20, 2025, along with subsequent guidance from the Of fice \nof Personnel Management, which addresses return to in- person work requirements for \nfederal government employees in the executive branch.\n12  ManTech asserts that these \n \napproach is \u2018incumbent capture,\u2019 the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if \nincumbent capture is not successful.\u201d  Id. at 55; see also id. at 8-9 (staffing and \ntransition staffing requirements).  The RFQ provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor\u2019s approach.  Id.  at 64. \n10  In its protest, ManTech initially asserted that its quotation should have been rated \nhigher under each of these three evaluation factors --but subsequently withdrew its \nprotest regarding the low confidence rating it received under the demonstration factor .  \nSupp. Comments at  2 n.2.    \n11 In its various protest submissions, ManTech raises arguments that are in addition to, \nor variations of, those specifically discussed below.  We have considered all of ManTech\u2019s arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest.  \n12 The full text of the presidential memorandum states:  \u201cHeads of all departments and \nagencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in -person at their respective duty stations on a full -time basis, provided \n(continued...)   Page 6 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  actions \u201cdrastically altered\u201d the agency\u2019s requirements for this procurement and, \naccordingly, asserts that the agency was required to amend the solicitation--and allow offerors to submit revised quotations.  Protest at 21.   \n   \nManTech acknowledges that the return to in- person work requirements do not apply to \ncontractors, see Protest at 22 n.8, and ManTech\u2019s protest does not identify any \nparticular contract performance requirement that will be altered by the presidential memorandum.  Nonetheless, referencing its contract performance prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, ManTech makes the general assertion that coordination between \ncontractor and government personnel \u201cis best accomplished by co- locating the \nmembers of these teams --both federal and contractor alike--at the FBI\u2019s facility in \nClarksburg, [West Virginia] . . . which the Agency will be required to consider when implementing its in- office policies.\u201d  Id. at 22.   \n In response to this allegation, the agency first states that it did, in fact, consider place of performance requirements when drafting the RFQ, and established on- site \nrequirements for certain contractor personnel.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see RFQ \nat 15.  The agency further points out that ManTech\u2019s protest fails to identify any \nparticular contract performance requirement that will be materially altered by the return to in-person work requirement for government personnel.  Finally, the agency notes that \nthe solicitation expressly provides that the agency may subsequently change work locations for contractor personnel where appropriate.  Req. for Dismissal at 2- 4; see \nRFQ at  15.  Accordingly, the agency maintains that ManTech\u2019s general assertion of \nchanged contractor requirements that allegedly flow from the presidential memorandum, without more, is insufficient to form a valid basis for protest.  We agree.  \n Our Bid Protest Regulations provide that a protest must include a detailed statement of \nthe legal and factual grounds for the protest, and that the grounds stated be legally sufficient.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.1(c)(4), 21.1(f), and 21.5(f).  These requirements contemplate \nthat a protester will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient, if \nuncontradicted, to establish the likelihood that the protester will prevail in its claim of improper agency action.  Midwest Tube Fabricators, Inc. , B-407166, B -407167, Nov. 20, \n2012, 2012 CPD \u00b6 324 at 3.  \n Here, ManTech\u2019s general assertion that in- person work requirements for federal \nemployees will impact the contract requirements --without identification of any particular \nmaterial impact on the contract requirements and contractor\u2019s performance--fails to meet the required standard.  First, as discussed above, the solicitation incorporates the agency\u2019s consideration of on- site performance requirements for certain contractor \npersonnel, and further provides that the agency may change work location requirements for contractor personnel as appropriate.  Second, ManTech\u2019s protest fails to \nmeaningfully address how the executive actions will affect this task order\u2019s requirements \n \nthat the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.\u201d  Presidential Memorandum, Return to In -Person Work , 90 Fed. Reg. 8251 (Jan.  28, 2025).   Page 7 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  to acquire agile teams for the delivery of digital and information technology services to \nthe FBI\u2019s CJIS; rather, ManTech\u2019s allegation rests entirely on its purported belief that co-location is the \u201cbest\u201d way to perform the work.  Protest at  22.  Finally, as the agency \npoints out and ManTech acknowledges, the presidential memorandum and accompanying guidance address remote work arrangements for federal government employees in the executive branch; neither \u201creferences contractors or contractor performance at  all.\u201d  Req. for Dismissal at  3. \n In short, ManTech has failed to identify the specific circumstances presented by the presidential memorandum --in the context of this procurement --that could be construed \nto constitute \u201ca material departure from the assumptions set forth in the solicitation.\u201d  See Chronos Sols. , LLC,  et al. , B-417870.2 et al. , Oct. 1, 2020, 2020 CPD \u00b6  395 at  14 \n(sustaining protest where agency did not consider significant changes in the law, as well as agency\u2019s policies and market conditions, directly applicable to the subject matter of the procurement).  On this record, ManTech\u2019s allegation is insufficient and is dismissed.    Evaluation Challenges  \n Next, ManTech challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of its quotation under the corporate experience and staffing approach evaluation factors.\n13  Based on these alleged \nevaluation errors, ManTech also challenges the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff decision.  \n \nCorporate Experience Factor  \n \nFor the corporate experience factor, the agency assigned ManTech a rating of \u201csome \nconfidence\u201d and found four aspects of the quotation that decreased the agency\u2019s \nconfidence in ManTech\u2019s successful performance of the task order.  ManTech\u2019s protest \nexpresses its disagreement with each of the four assessments.   \n For example, with regard to ManTech\u2019s third example of its prior experience, the agency \nconcluded that, even following discussions, ManTech\u2019s quotation failed to reflect \nexperience that was \u201csimilar in size and scope\u201d to the task order requirements.\n14  AR, \nTab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at 5.  More specifically, the \nagency noted a lack of detail in the quotation\u2019s description of prior tasks, stating that the prior effort appeared to be \u201cmore of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) effort rather \n \n13 As noted above, ManTech initially challenged--and subsequently withdrew --its \nchallenge to the agency\u2019s assignment of a low confidence rating under the demonstration evaluation factor.  See Supp. Comments at 2 n.2.  \n14 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to submit information for three contracts \nthat \u201care similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity\u201d to the solicitation requirements.  RFQ at  54.  Page 8 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  than a combination of development, test, integration and O&M\u201d.15  Id.  In this context, \nManTech expresses its disagreement with the agency\u2019s assessments, maintaining that \nits revised quotation \u201cprovided specific details\u201d and asserting that the agency\u2019s evaluation was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d  Protest at  28-29.  Alternatively, ManTec h asserts that \nthe agency\u2019s discussions were \u201cinadequate and misleading\u201d because, in ManTech\u2019s \nview, \u201cit is inexplicable how the Agency could have maintained those criticisms to begin \nwith in the face of the revisions to ManTech\u2019s proposal.\u201d  Supp. Comments at  2; Protest \nat 28. \n \nThe agency responds that it properly concluded, following discussions, that ManTech\u2019s \nrevised quotation continued to contain inadequate detail to demonstrate that the prior \neffort encompassed the scope of the required activities, reiterating its view that \nManTech\u2019s description of the prior effort reflected primarily O&M activities.  COS at 11.  More specifically, the agency provides a list of task descriptions drawn from ManTech\u2019s quotation, stating:   \n \nManTech provided the below tasks performed in [its prior contract] which were the bulk of tasks and are clearly O&M activities.  Examples of O&M include . . . training, monitoring administration, and operational support which often requires development of upgrade\/enhancements to current system function, development of dashboards to monitor performance, security, workflow, etc. for system and subsystem components reports, and deployment of a developed system.   \n Id.  In short, the agency maintains that, based on the specific examples drawn from \nManTech\u2019s revised quotation, the agency reasonably concluded that the prior effort was \u201clargely O&M experience and fail[s] to meet the solicitation requirements.\u201d  Id.   \n In responding to ManTech\u2019s complaint regarding the adequacy of discussions, the agency notes that one of the four evaluation notices provided to ManTech contained the following statements:  \n \n[ManTech\u2019s quotation regarding] corporate experience failed to demonstrate . . . a mature understanding of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles and practices which would require some Government intervention to successfully deliver the requirements.  \n \n    *     *     *     *     * \n[The prior contract] was more of an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) example rather than the development, test, integration and O&M requirements of the [task order at issue].   \n \n \n15 The task order requirements \u201c[are] comprised of four key areas[:]  development, \ntesting, integration and O&M.\u201d  AR, Tab 6- 1, Consensus Evaluation at 5; see RFQ \nat 4-10; see generally  AR, Tab 3- 2, RFQ attach. 2, Statement of Work.     Page 9 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  See AR, Tab 4 -1, Evaluation Notice at 1, 3.  In this regard, the agency argues that it \nproperly and sufficiently advised ManTech of its concerns.  Supp. MOL at  7-8. \n \nWhere, as here, a procurement is conducted pursuant to FAR subpart  8.4, our Office \nwill not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s evaluation was reasonable and \nconsistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , B-409114 et al. , Jan. 27, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 58 \nat 8.  A protester\u2019s disagreement with a procuring agency\u2019s evaluation judgments, \nwitho ut more, does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable.

However, exchanges that do occur with vendors in FAR part 8 procurements, \nlike all other aspects of such procurements, must be fair and equitable.

When an agency engages in \ndiscussions with an offeror, the discussions must be \u201cmeaningful,\u201d that is, sufficiently detailed so as to lead an offeror into the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or \nrevision.  See  FAR 15.306(d)(3); Southeastern Kidney Council , B-412538, Mar. 17, \n2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6  90 at 4.  Agencies, however, are not required to \u201cspoon- feed\u201d an \nofferor during discussions by identifying every possible area where a proposal might be improved or suggesting alternative approaches.  Vizada Inc. , B-405251 et al. , Oct. 5, \n2011, 2011 CPD \u00b6  235 at  11. \n \nHere, the record shows that, following discussions, ManTech revised its quotation by inserting the words \u201cdevelopment, test, integration, and operations support,\u201d deleting one task that used the word \u201cO&M,\u201d and adding several tasks descriptions.  AR, Tab 5-1, ManTech Phase One Quotation at  12; see also Comments and Supp. Protest \nat 9 (showing track changes).  After evaluating ManTech\u2019s revised quotation, the \nagency found that its concerns were not resolved and identified this as a decreased confidence area.   AR, Tab  6-1, Consensus Evaluation (Corporate Experience) at  5.  As \nthe contracting officer explains, the information added to ManTech\u2019s quotation was still \u201cclearly O&M activit[y]\u201d and failed to meet the solicitation\u2019s requirements to address the various  elements of SAFe framework.  COS at 11.  \n Based on our review of the record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s evaluation of ManTech\u2019s quotation under the corporate experience factor or the adequacy of the discussions.  In revising its quotation, ManTech inserted various words and deleted the task that specifically referenced O&M --but, in evaluating the revised quotation, the \nagency considered the entirety of the quotation and found that it still did not address development, test, integration and O&M.  In our view, the agency reasonably concluded that ManTech\u2019s revised quotation still failed to meaningfully address the solicitation requirements and the agency\u2019s concerns raised during discussions.  Moreover, the plain language of the agency\u2019s evaluation notice identified the aspects of ManTec h\u2019s \nquotation that needed to be addressed to include the agency\u2019s express concern that  Page 10 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  ManTech\u2019s experience reflected O&M work rather than the broader requirement s of the \ntask order.  ManTech\u2019s various expressions of disagreement, without more, are \ninsufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably.  Accordingly, this protest ground is denied.  \n \nStaffing Approach Factor  \n For the staffing approach factor, the agency assigned ManTech\u2019s quotation a rating of \u201csome confidence,\u201d and found six areas that decreased the agency\u2019s confidence in ManTech\u2019s successful task order performance.  ManTech\u2019s protest expresses its disagreement with each of the assessments.   \n For example, the agency criticized ManTech\u2019s focus on hiring of incumbent staff at the beginning of the transition period, and its failure to begin recruiting external hires until after the first [redacted]  days, describing this as a \u201creactive approach to staffing and \ntransition that introduces significant risk.\u201d\n16  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award at 11; see AR \nTab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing Approach) at 3- 4.  ManTech acknowledges \nthat its quotation stated that, following the first [redacted] days of the transition period, \nManTech would \u201c[c]onduct internal and external hiring and outreach events (if needed),\u201d see AR, Tab 5- 1, ManTech Quotation at 22, but nonetheless, asserts that the agency\u2019s \nconcern was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d  Protest at 31.  \n The agency defends its assessment on the basis that ManTech\u2019s quotation indicated it would delay recruitment activities for external hires until after the first portion of the transition period had passed, concluding that ManTech\u2019s focus on incumbent capture \nrather than \u201csimultaneously\u201d conducting external recruitment activities created risk that \ncould \u201cdisrupt work.\u201d  COS at 13- 14; see AR, Tab 6- 2, Consensus Evaluation (Staffing \nApproach) at 3- 4.  More specifically, the agency notes that ManTech\u2019s delayed \napproach to recruiting external hires could \u201ccreate a security backlog and place a significant strain on the onboarding process.\u201d  COS at 13- 14. \n As noted above, our Office will not reevaluate quotations, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency; rather, we will review the record to ensure that the agency\u2019s \nevaluation was reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable procurement laws and regulations.  See, e.g., VariQ Corp. , supra.   \n \nHere, ManTech acknowledges the agency\u2019s \u201ccorrect\u201d reading of its quotation.  Comments and Supp. Protest at  10-11.  While ManTech contends that the agency \n\u201cignored\u201d other \u201cpre- transition recruitment activities\u201d in its quotation, id. , the protester \ndoes not explain how this addressed the RFQ\u2019s transition requirements or mitigated the \n \n16 As noted above, the RFQ required vendors to discuss their proposed \u201cmethodologies \nand capabilities to recruit and retain employees\u201d; stated that \u201c[i]f the Quoter\u2019s transition approach is \u2018incumbent capture\u2019, the Quoter shall provide mitigation strategies if incumbent capture is not successful\u201d; and provided that the agency would make confidence assessments regarding each vendor\u2019s approach.  RFQ at 54- 55, 64.   Page 11 B-421560.14; B -421560.16  agency\u2019s concerns about recruiting delays during transition.  For example, ManTech\u2019s \nquotation indicated it had [redacted] , but these activities were limited to the time period \nleading up to a possible task order award and not during transition.  See  AR, Tab  5-1, \nManTech Phase One Quotation at  21.  These aspects of the quotation do not address \nManTech\u2019s decision to wait until [redacted]  days into the transition period to address \nstaffing if incumbent capture was not successful.  On this record, we find no basis to question the agency\u2019s concerns regarding the potential risks associated with ManTech\u2019s staffing approach.  This protest ground is denied.  \n Best-Value Tradeoff Decision  \n \nFinally, ManTech challenges the agency\u2019s best -value tradeoff decision \u201cbased upon an \nimproper evaluation.\u201d  Protest at 37.  To the extent this complaint is based on \nManTech\u2019s various allegations that we have rejected, the protest fails to state a valid basis of protest.  See , e.g., CORE O\u2019Ahu, LLC, B -421714, B -421714.2, Aug. 31, 2022, \n2023 CPD \u00b6 212 at 11.  In any event, the record shows that the agency considered the detailed evaluation documentation, compared the competing quotations, and concluded:  \u201cEven though ManTech\u2019s solution is lower priced, the Government determined the lower \nprice is not worth the risks associated with its Staffing Approach and ability to successfully execute work within the SAFe framework.\u201d  AR, Tab 8, Basis of Award \nat 15.  O n the record here, ManTech has not established that the agency\u2019s best -value \ntradeoff decision was flawed.  \n \nThe protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.  \n \nEdda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "

        "Summary":"1.  Protest that agency improperly rejected protester\u2019s proposal is denied where the protester failed to provide a certification required by solicitation provision implementing \nrelevant Buy American requirements . \n 2.  Protester is not an interested party to challenge other aspects of agency\u2019s evaluation where the protester was not eligible for award as a result of submitting a technically unacceptable proposal.  \nDECISION  \n Automated Precision, Inc. (API), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, protests the award of a contract to Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Inc., of Kingstown, Rhode Island, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N68335- 22-R-0163, issued by the \nDepart ment of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, for laser trackers and \nassociated component parts for the V -22 aircraft.  The protester contends that the \nagency improperly rejected API\u2019s proposal for failing to meet solicitation requirements.  \n We deny the protest in part and d ismiss  it in part.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The procurement history for this requirement spans several years.  The Navy first issued the solicitation on April 22, 2022, seeking commercially available off -the-shelf \nlaser trackers capable of performing highly accurate three- dimensional measurements  Page 2 B-422063.2  for the V -22 aircraft.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and  Memorandum of Law \n(COS\/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation was issued on \nan unrestricted basis and contemplated the award of a fixed- price contract.  RFP at 1, 3.  \nAward was to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest -priced, technically \nacceptable proposal.  Id.  at 3-4.   \n \nThe solicitation identified numerous minimum technical requirements the proposed laser \ntracker product was required to meet to be considered acceptable.  Id . at 5.  A s relevant \nhere, the proposed laser tracker was required to meet a humidity requirement of \u201c0 to 95 [percent] non- condensing.\u201d  Id.   The solicitation indicated that \u201c[a]ll proposals will be \nevaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements set forth in the \nsolicitation [,]\u201d and \u201c[a] technical proposal must be found to be acceptable in all areas to \nbe considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.\u201d  Id . at 4 .  The RFP further \nadvised that a proposal  with an unacceptable rating under the technical factor  will result \nin the entire proposal being found unacceptable and eliminated from the competition.  Id.   \n In addition, the solicitation incorporated by reference Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.225- 7001, \u201cBuy American and Balance of \nPayments Program.\u201d  RFP at 46.  The clause implements  the Buy American statute,  \n41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8301- 8305 (formerly the Buy American Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10a- 10d) and \nthe Department of Defense Balance of Payments Program, by establishing a preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except for foreign end products of \ncertai n qualify ing countries.  The solicitation also incorporated DFARS provision \n252.225- 7000, Buy American--Balance of Payments Program Certificate (Buy American \ncertificate), which requires offerors to certify whether their proposed products are domestic end products from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.\n2  RFP at 46; DFARS \nprovision 252.225- 7000(c).  \n The agency received three timely proposals, including proposals  from API and \nHexagon.  COS\/MOL at 3.  On September 27, 2023, the agency awarded the contract to Hexagon as the lowest -priced, technically acceptable offer.  Id.  API then filed a \nprotest with our Office on October 4.  A fter the agency notified our Office that the Navy \nintended to take corrective action by  re-evaluat ing proposals, we dismissed API\u2019s \n \n1 Citations to the record are to the pages in the Adobe PDF documents , unless \notherwise noted.   \n2 Agencies may have accompanying evaluation obligations depending upon the certified \norigin of proposed end products.  For example, if an end product is certified  as a foreign \nend product, the agency must evaluate the proposal in accordance with part 225 of the DFARS, which instructs the agency to apply an evaluation factor of 50 percent to a proposal if the low -priced proposal is a foreign end product that is not otherwise exempt \nfrom the price evaluation factors under the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program.

Automated Precision, Inc. , B-422063 (unpublished decision); \nCOS\/MOL at 3-4. \n \nOn February 12, 2024,  as part of  the corrective action re evaluation , the agency  \ndetermined that it had mistakenly identified API\u2019s proposal as technically acceptable.  \nCOS\/MOL at 4.  Consequently, the Navy opened discussions with all remaining offerors and requested additional information from API to confirm whether API\u2019s proposed laser tracker product conform ed to solicitation requirements.   AR, Tab 9, Feb. 23, Discussion \nLetter at 1.  Specifically, the agency explained that the product brochure API included with its proposal listed the relative humidity as 10- 95 percent, conflicting with the \nsolicitation\u2019s minimum requirement of 0- 95 percent.  Id.  The discussion letter also noted \nAPI\u2019s missing Buy American certificate and requested that API complete and submit the Buy American certificate,  individually addressing each contract line item number  (CLIN)  \nidentified in the solicitation.  Id .; COS\/MOL at 4 . \n In response, API submitted a letter to the Navy and attached an updated product brochure for the proposed Radian Plus model, explaining that API had included an \noutdated brochure with its initial proposal and noting the model\u2019s current specifications reflect ed the solicitation\u2019s required humidity figure of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 11, API \nRevised Proposal, March 14 at 1, 4.  API also submitted the required Buy American certificate where API certified the country of origin for its proposed end products.  Id.  \nat 7-9. \n On July 24, the agency amended the solicitation to include the most recent versions of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 and DFARS clause 252.225- 7001 and to identify all \nCLINs  the agency considered \u201cend products\u201d for purposes of Buy American compliance \nand certification.  AR, Tab 13, RFP Amendment 0004; COS\/MOL at 5.  As a result, the \nNavy opened a second round of discussions and requested that API update its  Buy \nAmerican certificat e to conform with the amended solicitation.  AR, Tab 14, July 24, \nDiscussion Letter at 1.  After API submitted its updated Buy American certificate, the Navy initiated a third round of discussions and requested that API correct errors the \nagency identified in API\u2019s Buy American certificate.  AR, Tab 18, August 26, Discussion Letter at 1.  On August 29, API submitted a corrected Buy American certificate to the \nNavy .  AR, Tab  20, API August 29, Buy American Certificate; COS\/MOL at 5.  \n On November 14, the agency notified offerors that discussions were closed and requested final proposal revisions, indicating that the Navy \u201cintend[ed] to make award \nwithout any further discussions or obtaining further proposal revisions.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, Request for Final Proposal Revision at 1.  The agency also advised offerors that \u201c[m]ajor revisions to your proposal are not anticipat ed; however, should you revise your \nproposal in any way, rationale for each revision must be provided in sufficient detail,  Page 4 B-422063.2  including substantiation, as a response to this [final proposal revision] letter.\u201d3  Id.; \nCOS\/MOL at 5 -6.  \n \nAPI submitted a timely final proposal revision , which substituted a new tracker model, \nthe Integrated Laser Tracker (iLTx), in place of the Radian Plus model that API had \nproposed previously.  AR, Tab 24, Final Proposal Revision at 2.  API included updated \npricing and an updated brochure detailing the iLTx product speci fications.  AR, Tab 24, \nFinal Proposal Revision at 4 .  API did not, however, include an updated Buy American \ncertificate  for the new tracker model .  COS\/MOL at 6.  \n \nOn March 21, 2025, the Navy concluded its evaluation, determining that the new \nproduct submitted by API, the iLTx laser tracker, was technically unacceptable because \nthe specifications in the product brochure API submitted indicated 10- 95 percent \nhumidity,  conflicting with the solicitation\u2019s minimum 0- 95 percent humidity requirement.  \nAR, Tab 26, Source Selection Decision (SSD)  at 2.  The agency also rejected API\u2019s \nproposal as noncompliant because API failed to submit a Buy American certificate for \nthe new laser tracker .  Id. at 3.  The Navy then identified Hexagon as the responsible \nand technically acceptable offeror with the lowest price and recommended lifting the \nstop- work order on the contract previously awarded to Hexagon.  Id . at 4; COS\/MOL \nat 7-8.   \n \nAfter the agency notified API  of the new selection decision and provided API with a \ndebriefing, API filed this protest with our Office.  \n DISCUSSION \n The protester contends the agency unreasonably evaluated API\u2019s lower -priced proposal \nas technically unacceptable.  Protest at 1- 7.  Specifically, API argues that the agency \nerred by rejecting API\u2019s proposal for failing to submit the Buy American certification required by the solicitation and for not allowing API to remedy this \u201ccorrectable oversight\u201d though clarifications.  Id . at 5 -6.  The protester also argues the agency should \nhave allowed API to clarify and update the product specification information, as API was \nallowed to do following the submission of its initial proposal .  Id. at 3.  The protester \nfurther  suggests that the Navy may have disparately evaluated proposals by relaxing \nthe solicitation\u2019s minimum relative humidity requirement for the awardee but not for API.\n4  Id. at 2-5.  We have reviewed all of the protester\u2019s arguments, and although we \n \n3 The agency also notified API that if did not have any additional updates to its proposal, \nAPI \u201cneed not provide anything more than a letter stating that the proposal and responses provided during discussions constitute the [final proposal revision ].\u201d\n  \nCOS\/MOL at 5.  \n4 API elected to proceed with its protest without counsel, and our Office did not issue a \nprotective order for this protest.  As such, our discussion of some aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation is, necessarily, general in nature to avoid reference to non- public \ninformation.   Page 5 B-422063.2  do not address every argument in this decision, we find no basis to sustain API\u2019s \nprotest.5  \n \nBuy American Certificate  \n The protester argues that the agency unreasonably rejected API\u2019s final proposal revision for failing to certify whether API\u2019s  proposed products were domestic end \nproducts from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.  Protest at 5- 7.  API argues  that the \nNavy \u201cneither requested [Buy American] compliance documentation with API\u2019s [final revised proposal] nor provided API with a form or opportunity to certify compliance[.]\u201d  Id. at 5.  Relatedly, API contends that the solicitation failed to include the provision at \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.225- 2, Buy American Certificate, which \n\u201cdepriv[ed] API of a fair chance to demonstrate compliance.\u201d  Id. at 6.  API also asserts \nthat because its proposed iLTx laser tracker is \u201cunequivocally [a] domestic end product,\u201d the agency should have allowed API to submit a revised proposal or sought \u201cclarifications for minor or clerical errors\u201d if the agency requir ed documentation \nconfirmin g the iLTx laser tracker\u2019s Buy American compliance.  Id.    \n As discussed below, these arguments are without merit.  \n As an initial matter,  as the agency  correctly  notes, solicitations issued by Department of \nDefense agencies, such as the Navy here, must include DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, instead of FAR provision 52.225- 2.  COS\/MOL at 18; DFARS \n225.1101(2)(i).  As discussed above, DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 was incorporated \nby reference into the solicitation; as a result, all offerors were notified of the requirement to certify thei r proposed products as domestic end products, qualifying country end \nproducts, or other  foreign end products.  See DFARS provision 252. 225-7000(c).  We \nsee no error associated with the agency incorporati ng into the solicitation DFARS \nprovision 252.225- 7000, and not FAR provision 52.225- 2.\n6  \n \n \n5 For example, several of API\u2019s allegations questioned the basis for the inclusion of \ncertain solicitation requirements, such as the solicitation\u2019s 0- 95 percent minimum \nhumidity requirement.  See Protest at 2- 7.  To the extent these arguments  challenge  the \nterms of the solicitation, such as the agency\u2019s decision to include the requirement at section 1.01(m) of the RFP concerning 0- 95 percent relative humidity or the agency\u2019s \ndecision to incorporate DFARS provision 252.225- 7000,  we find them to be untimely  \nsolicitation challenges that should have been raised prior to the closing time for receipt \nof proposals.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , B-420955.2, Oct. 31, 2022, 2022 \nCPD \u00b6 276 at 4 .   \n6 At any rate , as noted above, API failed to challenge the terms of the solicitation, such \nas the incorporation of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, prior to the closing time  for \nreceipt of proposals ; as a result, any such challenge is now untimely.  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , supra at 4.    Page 6 B-422063.2  Second, we find no merit to  the argument that the agency was required to further notify \nAPI of its obligation to submit a current and correct Buy American certificate  with its final \nproposal revision.  Protest at 5- 7.  API initially proposed the Radian Plus laser tracker \nmodel.  Id . at 1 -3; COS\/MOL at 4.  After multiple  rounds of discussion where the agency \neither specifically requested API\u2019s missing Buy American certificate or identified \ndeficiencies contained therein, API elected to propose a new laser tr acker product --the \niLTx laser tracker --in its final proposal revision.7  Protest at 1 -2; AR, Tab 24, API Final \nRevised Proposal at 2, 4.  Under the terms of the solicitation and DFARS provision 252.225- 7000(c) , API was required to certify the country of origin for all proposed end \nproducts, including the iLTx laser tracker, or risk having its proposal rejected as non-compliant.\n8  We find unavailing any suggestion that the protester was not given \nsufficient notice of the need to submit Buy American certification of all end products identified in API\u2019s final proposal revision --particularly considering the agency\u2019s repeated \ndiscussion s with the protester concerning API\u2019s  missing or deficient Buy American \ncertificate s. \n Further , we reject the protester\u2019s argument that because of the iLTx laser tracker\u2019s \n\u201cindisputable domestic production,\u201d API should have been allowed to clarify the omission of API\u2019s Buy American certificate as a \u201cminor or clerical error[]\u201d without opening discussions.   Protest at 6.\n  As a general rule,  clarifications  are limited \nexchanges between an agency and an offeror for the purpose of  eliminating minor  \nuncertainties or  irregularities  in a proposal, and do not give an offeror the opportunity to \nrevise or modify its  proposal.  FAR 15.306(a)(2) ; Satellite Servs., Inc., B -295866, \nB-295866.2, Apr. 20, 2005, 2005 CPD \u00b6 84 at 2- 3 n.2.  Agencies have broad discretion \nas to whether to seek clarifications from offerors, but offerors have no automatic right to \nclarifications regarding proposals --and such communications cannot be used to cure \nproposal deficiencies or material omissions , materially alter the technical or cost \nelements of the proposal, or otherwise revise the proposal.  Alltech Engineering Corp ., \nB-414002.2, Feb. 6, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 49 at 6.   \n \nAlthough API views its proposal\u2019s omission of the Buy American certificate to be minor or clerical, correction of this omission would have required the agency to conduct discussions to allow API to submit the certification required by DFARS provision \n252.225- 7000(c) --a material solicitation requirement the agency addressed with API on \n \n7 In the context of an RFP, it is well established that the submission of a final proposal \nrevision demonstrates an offeror\u2019s intent to modify or replace its initial offer, thus extinguishing an agency\u2019s ability to accept the earlier offer.   See, e.g., UNICA- BPA JV, \nLLC, B-422580.3, Jan. 8, 2025, 2025 CPD \u00b6 2 at 4 .   \n8 As noted above, in solicitation amendment 0004 and in the second round of \ndiscussions with API the agency specifically identified the laser tracker CLIN as an \u201cend product ,\u201d as defined in DFARS clause 252.225- 7001, requiring certification in \naccordance with DFARS provision 252.225- 7000.  See AR, Tab 13, Amendment 0004 \nat 2; see also COS\/MOL at 5.    Page 7 B-422063.2  three prior occasions.9  Cf.

Nor are we persuaded by API\u2019s \nargument for the \u201cindisputable domestic production\u201d of the iLTx laser tracker as a basis for allowing clarification since the Buy American certificate is the manner in which offerors  certify the country of origin for all proposed end products --and API failed to \nsubmit the required certification notifying the agency of that fact . \n Finally, to the extent that API argues generally that the agency\u2019s  rejection of its final \nproposal revision was unreasonable, we disagree.  The solicitation indicated that \u201c[a]ll proposals will be evaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements \nset forth in the solicitation\u201d and that \u201c[a] technical proposal must be found to be \nacceptable in all areas to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.\u201d  RFP at 4.  Under these circumstances, the agency reasonably rejected API\u2019s proposal for failing to include the required Buy American certification.  It is an offeror \u2019s \nresponsibility to submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that \nclearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements.

We see no basis to fault the agency for enforcing the very terms of the solicitation requirement , discussed repeatedly with API , after API submitted a proposal \nthat again omitted the required Buy American certification.  \n \nInterested Party Dismissal  \n \nThe protester also alleges the agency erred by assessing API\u2019s proposal as technically unacceptable for failing to meet the solicitation\u2019s minimum relative humidity requirement and by not allowing API to submit a revised proposal, as was previously  permitted .

We do not need to resolve these issues, however, \nbecause we find that API is not an interested party to pursue its remaining challenges \nsince API\u2019s proposal fails to conform to a material solicitation requirement, rendering the  \nproposal technically unacceptable and ineligible for award.10 \n Under the bid protest provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, only an interested party may protest a federal procurement.  31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551- 3557.

Protest that agency improperly rejected protester\u2019s proposal is denied where the protester failed to provide a certification required by solicitation provision implementing \nrelevant Buy American requirements . \n 2.  Protester is not an interested party to challenge other aspects of agency\u2019s evaluation where the protester was not eligible for award as a result of submitting a technically unacceptable proposal.  \nDECISION  \n Automated Precision, Inc. (API), a small business of Rockville, Maryland, protests the award of a contract to Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Inc., of Kingstown, Rhode Island, under request for proposals (RFP) No. N68335- 22-R-0163, issued by the \nDepart ment of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, for laser trackers and \nassociated component parts for the V -22 aircraft.  The protester contends that the \nagency improperly rejected API\u2019s proposal for failing to meet solicitation requirements.  \n We deny the protest in part and d ismiss  it in part.  \n BACKGROUND  \n The procurement history for this requirement spans several years.  The Navy first issued the solicitation on April 22, 2022, seeking commercially available off -the-shelf \nlaser trackers capable of performing highly accurate three- dimensional measurements  Page 2 B-422063.2  for the V -22 aircraft.  Contracting Officer\u2019s Statement and  Memorandum of Law \n(COS\/MOL) at 2; Agency Report (AR), Tab 1, RFP at 5.1  The solicitation was issued on \nan unrestricted basis and contemplated the award of a fixed- price contract.  RFP at 1, 3.  \nAward was to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest -priced, technically \nacceptable proposal.  Id.  at 3-4.   \n \nThe solicitation identified numerous minimum technical requirements the proposed laser \ntracker product was required to meet to be considered acceptable.  Id . at 5.  A s relevant \nhere, the proposed laser tracker was required to meet a humidity requirement of \u201c0 to 95 [percent] non- condensing.\u201d  Id.   The solicitation indicated that \u201c[a]ll proposals will be \nevaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements set forth in the \nsolicitation [,]\u201d and \u201c[a] technical proposal must be found to be acceptable in all areas to \nbe considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.\u201d  Id . at 4 .  The RFP further \nadvised that a proposal  with an unacceptable rating under the technical factor  will result \nin the entire proposal being found unacceptable and eliminated from the competition.  Id.   \n In addition, the solicitation incorporated by reference Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.225- 7001, \u201cBuy American and Balance of \nPayments Program.\u201d  RFP at 46.  The clause implements  the Buy American statute,  \n41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8301- 8305 (formerly the Buy American Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10a- 10d) and \nthe Department of Defense Balance of Payments Program, by establishing a preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except for foreign end products of \ncertai n qualify ing countries.  The solicitation also incorporated DFARS provision \n252.225- 7000, Buy American--Balance of Payments Program Certificate (Buy American \ncertificate), which requires offerors to certify whether their proposed products are domestic end products from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.\n2  RFP at 46; DFARS \nprovision 252.225- 7000(c).  \n The agency received three timely proposals, including proposals  from API and \nHexagon.  COS\/MOL at 3.  On September 27, 2023, the agency awarded the contract to Hexagon as the lowest -priced, technically acceptable offer.  Id.  API then filed a \nprotest with our Office on October 4.  A fter the agency notified our Office that the Navy \nintended to take corrective action by  re-evaluat ing proposals, we dismissed API\u2019s \n \n1 Citations to the record are to the pages in the Adobe PDF documents , unless \notherwise noted.   \n2 Agencies may have accompanying evaluation obligations depending upon the certified \norigin of proposed end products.  For example, if an end product is certified  as a foreign \nend product, the agency must evaluate the proposal in accordance with part 225 of the DFARS, which instructs the agency to apply an evaluation factor of 50 percent to a proposal if the low -priced proposal is a foreign end product that is not otherwise exempt \nfrom the price evaluation factors under the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program.

Automated Precision, Inc. , B-422063 (unpublished decision); \nCOS\/MOL at 3-4. \n \nOn February 12, 2024,  as part of  the corrective action re evaluation , the agency  \ndetermined that it had mistakenly identified API\u2019s proposal as technically acceptable.  \nCOS\/MOL at 4.  Consequently, the Navy opened discussions with all remaining offerors and requested additional information from API to confirm whether API\u2019s proposed laser tracker product conform ed to solicitation requirements.   AR, Tab 9, Feb. 23, Discussion \nLetter at 1.  Specifically, the agency explained that the product brochure API included with its proposal listed the relative humidity as 10- 95 percent, conflicting with the \nsolicitation\u2019s minimum requirement of 0- 95 percent.  Id.  The discussion letter also noted \nAPI\u2019s missing Buy American certificate and requested that API complete and submit the Buy American certificate,  individually addressing each contract line item number  (CLIN)  \nidentified in the solicitation.  Id .; COS\/MOL at 4 . \n In response, API submitted a letter to the Navy and attached an updated product brochure for the proposed Radian Plus model, explaining that API had included an \noutdated brochure with its initial proposal and noting the model\u2019s current specifications reflect ed the solicitation\u2019s required humidity figure of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 11, API \nRevised Proposal, March 14 at 1, 4.  API also submitted the required Buy American certificate where API certified the country of origin for its proposed end products.  Id.  \nat 7-9. \n On July 24, the agency amended the solicitation to include the most recent versions of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 and DFARS clause 252.225- 7001 and to identify all \nCLINs  the agency considered \u201cend products\u201d for purposes of Buy American compliance \nand certification.  AR, Tab 13, RFP Amendment 0004; COS\/MOL at 5.  As a result, the \nNavy opened a second round of discussions and requested that API update its  Buy \nAmerican certificat e to conform with the amended solicitation.  AR, Tab 14, July 24, \nDiscussion Letter at 1.  After API submitted its updated Buy American certificate, the Navy initiated a third round of discussions and requested that API correct errors the \nagency identified in API\u2019s Buy American certificate.  AR, Tab 18, August 26, Discussion Letter at 1.  On August 29, API submitted a corrected Buy American certificate to the \nNavy .  AR, Tab  20, API August 29, Buy American Certificate; COS\/MOL at 5.  \n On November 14, the agency notified offerors that discussions were closed and requested final proposal revisions, indicating that the Navy \u201cintend[ed] to make award \nwithout any further discussions or obtaining further proposal revisions.\u201d  AR, Tab 22, Request for Final Proposal Revision at 1.  The agency also advised offerors that \u201c[m]ajor revisions to your proposal are not anticipat ed; however, should you revise your \nproposal in any way, rationale for each revision must be provided in sufficient detail,  Page 4 B-422063.2  including substantiation, as a response to this [final proposal revision] letter.\u201d3  Id.; \nCOS\/MOL at 5 -6.  \n \nAPI submitted a timely final proposal revision , which substituted a new tracker model, \nthe Integrated Laser Tracker (iLTx), in place of the Radian Plus model that API had \nproposed previously.  AR, Tab 24, Final Proposal Revision at 2.  API included updated \npricing and an updated brochure detailing the iLTx product speci fications.  AR, Tab 24, \nFinal Proposal Revision at 4 .  API did not, however, include an updated Buy American \ncertificate  for the new tracker model .  COS\/MOL at 6.  \n \nOn March 21, 2025, the Navy concluded its evaluation, determining that the new \nproduct submitted by API, the iLTx laser tracker, was technically unacceptable because \nthe specifications in the product brochure API submitted indicated 10- 95 percent \nhumidity,  conflicting with the solicitation\u2019s minimum 0- 95 percent humidity requirement.  \nAR, Tab 26, Source Selection Decision (SSD)  at 2.  The agency also rejected API\u2019s \nproposal as noncompliant because API failed to submit a Buy American certificate for \nthe new laser tracker .  Id. at 3.  The Navy then identified Hexagon as the responsible \nand technically acceptable offeror with the lowest price and recommended lifting the \nstop- work order on the contract previously awarded to Hexagon.  Id . at 4; COS\/MOL \nat 7-8.   \n \nAfter the agency notified API  of the new selection decision and provided API with a \ndebriefing, API filed this protest with our Office.  \n DISCUSSION \n The protester contends the agency unreasonably evaluated API\u2019s lower -priced proposal \nas technically unacceptable.  Protest at 1- 7.  Specifically, API argues that the agency \nerred by rejecting API\u2019s proposal for failing to submit the Buy American certification required by the solicitation and for not allowing API to remedy this \u201ccorrectable oversight\u201d though clarifications.  Id . at 5 -6.  The protester also argues the agency should \nhave allowed API to clarify and update the product specification information, as API was \nallowed to do following the submission of its initial proposal .  Id. at 3.  The protester \nfurther  suggests that the Navy may have disparately evaluated proposals by relaxing \nthe solicitation\u2019s minimum relative humidity requirement for the awardee but not for API.\n4  Id. at 2-5.  We have reviewed all of the protester\u2019s arguments, and although we \n \n3 The agency also notified API that if did not have any additional updates to its proposal, \nAPI \u201cneed not provide anything more than a letter stating that the proposal and responses provided during discussions constitute the [final proposal revision ].\u201d\n  \nCOS\/MOL at 5.  \n4 API elected to proceed with its protest without counsel, and our Office did not issue a \nprotective order for this protest.  As such, our discussion of some aspects of the agency\u2019s evaluation is, necessarily, general in nature to avoid reference to non- public \ninformation.   Page 5 B-422063.2  do not address every argument in this decision, we find no basis to sustain API\u2019s \nprotest.5  \n \nBuy American Certificate  \n The protester argues that the agency unreasonably rejected API\u2019s final proposal revision for failing to certify whether API\u2019s  proposed products were domestic end \nproducts from the United States, foreign end products from a qualifying country, or foreign end products from a non- qualifying country.  Protest at 5- 7.  API argues  that the \nNavy \u201cneither requested [Buy American] compliance documentation with API\u2019s [final revised proposal] nor provided API with a form or opportunity to certify compliance[.]\u201d  Id. at 5.  Relatedly, API contends that the solicitation failed to include the provision at \nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.225- 2, Buy American Certificate, which \n\u201cdepriv[ed] API of a fair chance to demonstrate compliance.\u201d  Id. at 6.  API also asserts \nthat because its proposed iLTx laser tracker is \u201cunequivocally [a] domestic end product,\u201d the agency should have allowed API to submit a revised proposal or sought \u201cclarifications for minor or clerical errors\u201d if the agency requir ed documentation \nconfirmin g the iLTx laser tracker\u2019s Buy American compliance.  Id.    \n As discussed below, these arguments are without merit.  \n As an initial matter,  as the agency  correctly  notes, solicitations issued by Department of \nDefense agencies, such as the Navy here, must include DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, instead of FAR provision 52.225- 2.  COS\/MOL at 18; DFARS \n225.1101(2)(i).  As discussed above, DFARS provision 252.225- 7000 was incorporated \nby reference into the solicitation; as a result, all offerors were notified of the requirement to certify thei r proposed products as domestic end products, qualifying country end \nproducts, or other  foreign end products.  See DFARS provision 252. 225-7000(c).  We \nsee no error associated with the agency incorporati ng into the solicitation DFARS \nprovision 252.225- 7000, and not FAR provision 52.225- 2.\n6  \n \n \n5 For example, several of API\u2019s allegations questioned the basis for the inclusion of \ncertain solicitation requirements, such as the solicitation\u2019s 0- 95 percent minimum \nhumidity requirement.  See Protest at 2- 7.  To the extent these arguments  challenge  the \nterms of the solicitation, such as the agency\u2019s decision to include the requirement at section 1.01(m) of the RFP concerning 0- 95 percent relative humidity or the agency\u2019s \ndecision to incorporate DFARS provision 252.225- 7000,  we find them to be untimely  \nsolicitation challenges that should have been raised prior to the closing time for receipt \nof proposals.  4 C.F.R. \u00a7  21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , B-420955.2, Oct. 31, 2022, 2022 \nCPD \u00b6 276 at 4 .   \n6 At any rate , as noted above, API failed to challenge the terms of the solicitation, such \nas the incorporation of DFARS provision 252.225- 7000, prior to the closing time  for \nreceipt of proposals ; as a result, any such challenge is now untimely.  4 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 21.2(a)(1); Vigor Marine LLC , supra at 4.    Page 6 B-422063.2  Second, we find no merit to  the argument that the agency was required to further notify \nAPI of its obligation to submit a current and correct Buy American certificate  with its final \nproposal revision.  Protest at 5- 7.  API initially proposed the Radian Plus laser tracker \nmodel.  Id . at 1 -3; COS\/MOL at 4.  After multiple  rounds of discussion where the agency \neither specifically requested API\u2019s missing Buy American certificate or identified \ndeficiencies contained therein, API elected to propose a new laser tr acker product --the \niLTx laser tracker --in its final proposal revision.7  Protest at 1 -2; AR, Tab 24, API Final \nRevised Proposal at 2, 4.  Under the terms of the solicitation and DFARS provision 252.225- 7000(c) , API was required to certify the country of origin for all proposed end \nproducts, including the iLTx laser tracker, or risk having its proposal rejected as non-compliant.\n8  We find unavailing any suggestion that the protester was not given \nsufficient notice of the need to submit Buy American certification of all end products identified in API\u2019s final proposal revision --particularly considering the agency\u2019s repeated \ndiscussion s with the protester concerning API\u2019s  missing or deficient Buy American \ncertificate s. \n Further , we reject the protester\u2019s argument that because of the iLTx laser tracker\u2019s \n\u201cindisputable domestic production,\u201d API should have been allowed to clarify the omission of API\u2019s Buy American certificate as a \u201cminor or clerical error[]\u201d without opening discussions.   Protest at 6.\n  As a general rule,  clarifications  are limited \nexchanges between an agency and an offeror for the purpose of  eliminating minor  \nuncertainties or  irregularities  in a proposal, and do not give an offeror the opportunity to \nrevise or modify its  proposal.

Agencies have broad discretion \nas to whether to seek clarifications from offerors, but offerors have no automatic right to \nclarifications regarding proposals --and such communications cannot be used to cure \nproposal deficiencies or material omissions , materially alter the technical or cost \nelements of the proposal, or otherwise revise the proposal.  Alltech Engineering Corp ., \nB-414002.2, Feb. 6, 2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 49 at 6.   \n \nAlthough API views its proposal\u2019s omission of the Buy American certificate to be minor or clerical, correction of this omission would have required the agency to conduct discussions to allow API to submit the certification required by DFARS provision \n252.225- 7000(c) --a material solicitation requirement the agency addressed with API on \n \n7 In the context of an RFP, it is well established that the submission of a final proposal \nrevision demonstrates an offeror\u2019s intent to modify or replace its initial offer, thus extinguishing an agency\u2019s ability to accept the earlier offer.   See, e.g., UNICA- BPA JV, \nLLC, B-422580.3, Jan. 8, 2025, 2025 CPD \u00b6 2 at 4 .   \n8 As noted above, in solicitation amendment 0004 and in the second round of \ndiscussions with API the agency specifically identified the laser tracker CLIN as an \u201cend product ,\u201d as defined in DFARS clause 252.225- 7001, requiring certification in \naccordance with DFARS provision 252.225- 7000.  See AR, Tab 13, Amendment 0004 \nat 2; see also COS\/MOL at 5.    Page 7 B-422063.2  three prior occasions.9  Cf.

Nor are we persuaded by API\u2019s \nargument for the \u201cindisputable domestic production\u201d of the iLTx laser tracker as a basis for allowing clarification since the Buy American certificate is the manner in which offerors  certify the country of origin for all proposed end products --and API failed to \nsubmit the required certification notifying the agency of that fact . \n Finally, to the extent that API argues generally that the agency\u2019s  rejection of its final \nproposal revision was unreasonable, we disagree.  The solicitation indicated that \u201c[a]ll proposals will be evaluated for compliance with [the] terms, conditions and requirements \nset forth in the solicitation\u201d and that \u201c[a] technical proposal must be found to be \nacceptable in all areas to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.\u201d  RFP at 4.  Under these circumstances, the agency reasonably rejected API\u2019s proposal for failing to include the required Buy American certification.  It is an offeror \u2019s \nresponsibility to submit a well -written proposal, with adequately detailed information that \nclearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements.

AR, Tab 11, API Revised Proposal, March 14 \nat 4.  When API submitted its final proposal revision, however, API included a product \nbrochure for a new product (the iLTx laser tracker) showing a relative humidity level at 10-95 percent, which the agency again noted conflicted with the solicitation\u2019s mini mum \nrelative humidity requirement of 0- 95 percent.  AR, Tab 26, SSD at 2; COS\/MOL at 6.  \nIn contrast, the product specifications included in Hexagon\u2019s proposal were consistent with other aspects of Hexagon\u2019s technical proposal affirming compliance with the \nsolicitation\u2019s humidity percentage requirements, see AR, Tab 3, Hexagon Proposal at 6, \n166, and, unlike API\u2019s proposal, Hexagon\u2019s proposal did not include product \nspecifications in direct conflict with the solicitation\u2019s humidity  percentage requirement.    Page 9 B-422063.2  the protester\u2019s challenges were sustained, we generally consider the protester\u2019s interest \nto be too remote to qualify as an interested party.  See, e.g., HCR Constr., Inc.; Southern Aire Contracting, Inc. , B-418070.4, B -418070.5, May 8, 2020, 2020 CPD  \n\u00b6 166 at 6- 7 n.6.  Accordingly, we conclude that API is not an interested party for \npurposes of challenging the agency\u2019s evaluation of the technical proposals submitted by API and Hexagon.    The protest is d enied in part and dismissed  in part.   \n Edda Emmanuelli Perez  \nGeneral Counsel  "
